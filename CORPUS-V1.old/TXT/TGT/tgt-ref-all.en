Another Balkan High Noon 
With the world focused on Iraq, North Korea, and a possible clash with Iran over nuclear weapons, Kosovo has fallen off the radar screen. 
That inattention will end soon; a decision about the province's fate is looming. 
The United States and its European friends have repeatedly stated their intent to make the difficult decision before the end of the year on whether to separate Kosovo from Serbia. 
This decision -- crucial to the future of an unstable region -- will test Western determination and unity. 
Negotiations this year in Vienna, brokered by the United Nations, showed that an agreed settlement between Serbia and Kosovo on "final status" will not happen. 
Talks continue, but, as UN negotiator and former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari diplomatically told the Security Council, they are effectively dead. 
No Serbian leader will agree to Kosovo's independence, because nationalism remains the dominant political force in the country. 
Indeed, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, the apostle of Serbian nationalism, has been trying in every way to undermine Kosovo's interim government. 
He is rushing to hold a national referendum this month on a new constitution without serious parliamentary debate or the usual public education. 
The main purpose of his new constitution is its preamble, which enshrines Kosovo as an inalienable part of Serbia. 
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians have proclaimed that they will not accept any tie to Serbia, no matter how tenuous. 
Throughout the 1990's, they virtually opted out of Serbian-run Kosovo by creating parallel institutions. 
Their forced mass exodus in 1999 and NATO's subsequent intervention, which ended Serbia's rule and established a quasi-state under UN administration, has made anything other than independence intolerable. 
Some time over the next month or two, the Balkan Contact Group — the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia -- will consider Ahtisaari's recommendations on Kosovo's final status and possibly propose a solution to the Security Council, which must make the final decision. 
In public, all Contact Group members have tried to leave the question of Kosovo's final status open, but informally the US and some of its allies have told the two parties that they will propose independence this year. 
Some members of the Security Council -- particularly Russia and China -- are opposed to or skeptical of an imposed settlement, and few governments favor dividing up another country's territory, however compelling the circumstances. 
Whether the Security Council will approve independence largely depends on averting a Russian veto, which will require considerable diplomatic effort. 
The nature of the independence bestowed is also important. 
An independent Kosovo must be secured and its minorities protected. 
Northern Kosovo, now largely under Belgrade's control, must not be partitioned off in all but name. 
In the interest of reducing the blow to Serbia, the Security Council must avoid granting independence in ways that are so contorted that the new state cannot effectively function. 
If the Security Council fails to reach a decision on final status, it will produce a GRAVE situation: Kosovo would declare independence unilaterally, and all nations would have to make up their mind whether or not to recognize the new state. 
If that happens, it is likely that the Serbs of North Kosovo would declare their own independence. 
At a minimum, Serbia would campaign strongly against recognition. 
In fact, Serbia's government is already trying to persuade the West to postpone a decision until mid-2007. 
It claims that if Kosovo is granted independence, the ultranationalist Radical Party will come to power in the next elections, and believes that holding elections as early as this year will cause the Contact Group to delay a proposal to the Security Council. 
Moreover, the government has encouraged the leaders of Bosnia's Republika Srpska to threaten to hold their own referendum on separation from a still fragile Bosnia. 
And they continue to push &#45;&#45; unsuccessfully &#45;&#45; for Ahtisaari's removal in order to prolong the Vienna talks. 
The timing of the constitutional referendum appears to be a part of this delaying strategy. 
Some hope that postponement will stimulate violence in Kosovo and further encourage Western reconsideration of independence. 
That tactic may be working. 
Many European Union countries are worried about the implications of taking away a country's territory, as well as the impact of Kosovo's independence on Serbian democracy. 
Given Serbia's political instability, they question the harm of a short-term postponement -- albeit mostly self-inflicted. 
But delay only offers more room for Kostunica to find ways to make a Security Council decision more difficult. 
The West must ignore Belgrade's siren song. 
Serbian politics will be chaotic and unstable for the foreseeable future, and Serbian politicians will attempt to present this as an excuse to avoid facing the loss of Kosovo. 
Likewise, there will be problems establishing ties between Serbia and Kosovo under any circumstances. 
But failure to proceed definitively now on Kosovo's final status will produce a worse Balkan situation, one that blocks Serbia's move toward the West and ultimate membership in the EU, condemns Kosovo's ethnic minorities to dangerous ambiguity, and imperils fragile states like Bosnia and Macedonia. 
No realistic solution exists for Kosovo but independence. 
If Serbia wants to join the West, it must not forsake that opportunity by trapping itself in its nationalist past. 
South Korea's Dangerous New Dawn 
North Korea's decision to expel UN atomic energy inspectors is but another reason to view Roh Moo Hyun's election as South Korea's president two weeks ago as an historical watershed. 
The beginning of his term not only coincides with one of the most dangerous episodes on the Korean peninsula in decades, but his presidency will also test South Korea's relations with the US to a degree that has not been seen for many years. 
Roh's victory over Lee Hoi Chang signifies a generational shift in Korean politics, with the young determined to gain a freer hand in Korea's relations with the US. 
Indeed, generational differences were the deciding factor in the race, replacing the regional sentiments that dominated every presidential race before this one. 
According to one report, over 60% of people in their twenties and thirties voted for Roh to produce a margin of 2.3% in this first two-man, head-to-head presidential race in 31 years. 
Roh's populist and nationalist stance will be swiftly and sorely tested by reality when he assumes power in February. 
But couple the generational changeover thaty put him in office with a strong popular desire for continued engagement with North Korea--notwithstanding North Korea's growing nuclear brinkmanship--and the recipe is complete for disputes with the US. 
Roh, a self-made man who passed a bar examination without going to college and law school, succeeded in convincing voters that he would usher in a new brand of politics reflecting South Korea's growing wealth and middle class sentiments, thereby sweeping away insider-dominated politics, regional bickering, and factional struggles. 
His style and rhetoric projected the fresh (for Korea!) image of a common man committed to eliminating the ossified networks of cronyism and corruption. 
For the first time in modern Korean history, the presidential campaign actually debated the central issues facing the country, rather than focussing on parties and personalities. 
Candidate Roh called for a new relationship between South Korea and the US, one based on the principle of independence and equality. 
For example, he said that he would not kow-tow to the US or visit Washington just for the sake of a photo opportunity He also promised to continue President Kim Dae Jung's "Sunshine policy" of engagement with the North. 
Remarkably, Roh won the election despite North Korea's decision to reactivate nuclear reactors that had been frozen since 1994. 
A few years ago this would have doomed Roh's candidacy. 
That he overcame this obstacle without changing his stance on engaging North Korea means that times have radically changed. 
A popular yearning for change, not the security situation, is now the overriding concern of ordinary Koreans. 
Roh's campaign also took advantage of a rising tide of anti-Americanism. 
The acquittal by a US military court of two American soldiers who accidentally killed two Korean schoolgirls with their armored car last June triggered street demonstrations across the country. 
Although President George W. Bush apologized twice for the deaths of the girls, demands continue to escalate for changing the Status of Force Agreement (SOFA) that governs the legal treatment of American troops stationed in South Korea. 
Ordinary Koreans insist that US soldiers who commit crimes should be tried in Korean courts. 
This expression of wounded national pride was enabled by South Korea's tremendous performance in the World Cup football tournament last summer, which helped convince ordinary Koreans that their country was fully grown up--and thus might be able to stand on its own without the presence of 37,000 US troops. 
Indeed, many ordinary people now view the US presence, and not North Korea's communist regime, as the biggest obstacle to unification. 
According to a recent poll, only 54.8% of Koreans now support the stationing of American troops in the country, while 31.7% oppose it. 
These sentiments will form part of the diplomatic test shaping Roh's presidency from the start, for he must re-engineer relations with America at the same time that the Bush administration is fretting about North Korea's nuclear ambitions and its role in spreading weapons of mass destruction to rogue states. 
For now, Korean voters--apparently impervious to the threat that North Korea's nuclear weapons poses--support Roh's policy of maintaining dialogue and economic exchange with the North. 
Under President Roh, South Korea's domestic politics and relations with the US and North Korea will require an almost total overhaul. 
Can he walk the tightrope of maintaining security on the peninsula, keeping America engaged, and retaining the support of the voters who elected him? 
Reconciling those goals would test even the most experienced and cynical of politicians, so it is anyone's guess as to whether President Roh can succeed. 
Failure, however, offers such a horrific prospect that no one can possibly hope for it. 
The Unilateral Road to Peace 
In the next three weeks, the Israeli army will do something unprecedented: instead of defending the country against external enemies or terrorism, it will evacuate -- by force if necessary -- 9,000 Israelis from their homes. 
Israel's unilateral withdrawal is the outcome of a deep political shift that has been caused by two somewhat contradictory convictions that have characterized Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's policies since 2003: first, that the US-initiated "road map" is going nowhere and, second, that the status quo is untenable. 
Certainly, according to Sharon's thinking, there is no future for 9,000 Jewish settlers living among 1.2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. 
Hence, in the absence of negotiations, a unilateral withdrawal is the only meaningful step towards de-escalation and stabilization. 
This policy has deeply divided Israel: the settlers -- mostly, but not exclusively religious -- feel betrayed by Sharon, "The Father of the Settlements." 
It is now the Israeli left that, however reluctantly, realizes that Sharon's new pragmatism may be the first step in the right direction. 
Like de Gaulle in Algeria, Sharon has reshuffled the cards of Israel's politics. 
The last weeks have seen massive demonstrations, some of them verging on violence; many of the settlers have declared that they will not obey government orders to evacuate. 
The army and the police have mobilized almost 50,000 troops to carry out evictions. 
This forcible approach is traumatic not only for the settlers, but also for many other Israelis. 
Only the next days and weeks will tell whether the evacuation proceeds peacefully or not. 
In the meantime, Sharon has paid heavily for his policies. 
Two right-wing parties have left his ruling coalition, he has lost his majority within his own Likud Party, and his finance minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has quit his government. 
Only by bringing Shimon Peres's Labor Party into his cabinet did Sharon manage to retain his parliamentary majority. 
The question, of course, is what will happen after the Gaza disengagement. 
Many governments were initially skeptical about disengagement, but realized that -- as the Washington saying goes -- "this is the only game in town." 
Among them, as well as among the Palestinians, one hears the hope that after the Gaza withdrawal, it will be possible to return to the road map and to resume negotiations leading to a final agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. 
This is a major mistake. 
While motivated by the best of intentions, the hope of reviving the road map is out of touch with reality. 
Future negotiations will have to deal with the ultimate borders between Israel and Palestine, the fate of 200,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, the status of Jerusalem, and with the problem of the 1947-48 Palestinian refugees. 
On all of these issues, the gulf between the Israeli and Palestinian positions has not narrowed since the failed negotiations at Camp David in 2000, while fear and distrust have increased. 
To attempt negotiations under these circumstances would not only be an exercise in futility, but may merely deepen alienation and suspicion on both sides. 
The failure of the Annan Plan for Cyprus suggests that good intentions are not enough -- and the disagreements in Cyprus were miniscule compared to what divides Israelis and Palestinians. 
So what can be done? 
Probably the only rational way to proceed would be to acknowledge that unilateral steps on both sides can still further the cause of de-escalation and ultimate reconciliation. 
On the Israeli side, further disengagement from dozens of isolated and small settlements on the West Bank, entailing the evacuation of between 20,000 and 30,000 settlers, may be politically feasible and would give the Palestinians a contiguous territory on the West Bank. 
On the Palestinian side, consolidation of the Palestinian Authority's control over a dozen security services and militias would be an important step. 
The Palestinian leader, Abu Mazen, recognizes this, but the question is whether he can deliver. 
The Palestinian leadership could also start down the difficult road of telling the refugees that -- contrary to almost 50 years of Palestinian propaganda -- they will not return to Israel, but will have to be settled in the West Bank and Gaza, the areas that will become part of the eventual Palestinian state. 
In an ideal world, conflicts end by agreements and treaties. 
But in the real world -- and Cyprus, Bosnia, and Kosovo may be examples -- stabilization and the slow de-escalation of violence can sometimes achieve the same end, even without formal agreement. 
In the absence of plausible alternatives, one hopes that this will also be the case for Israelis and Palestinians. 
A World Restored? 
BERLIN: Like old battle horses feeling young as the bugle sounds, Cold War strategists are feeling the adrenalin mount as missile defense becomes front page news. 
True, the defense against missiles which Bill Clinton (reluctantly) and George W. Bush (enthusiastically) are proposing -- with massive support from America's Congress -- is different from Ronald Reagan's Star Wars dream of twenty years ago: NMD is supposed to catch only a modest number of warheads, not provide complete protection against enemy missiles. 
Nevertheless, the issue rekindles old debates over deterrence, mutual assured destruction and nuclear arms control, and revives the rivalry between the nuclear powers just when nuclear weapons had lost much of their relevance. 
Amazingly, debate is heating up even though it is uncertain that NMD will work. 
Even if it does work, it will be ten to fifteen years, possibly longer, before NMD is operational. 
So tempers are rising over something which, if and when it happens in the distant future, may or may not have much impact. 
Normally cautious governments are positioning themselves now as if the future were around the corner. 
What explains this odd behavior? 
Not blind faith in technology. 
After all, the history of missile defense is a tale of technology constantly disappointing its advocates in and out of government. 
No one in his right mind can assume that something never achieved before, namely destroying a small number of warheads in flight, will happen over night. 
Of the three tests so far conducted, one failed almost, two entirely, which is why President Clinton left the matter to his successor. 
If President Bush, as he has hinted, now favors a different design, it will take even more time to develop the architecture and devise a test program. 
Nobody can be sure that it will work either. 
Governments are worried now, not because of capabilities, but because of America's real or imagined intentions. 
While Americans claim that NMD is not directed against anyone, that all the US wants is to protect its citizens against states like Iraq or North Korea, almost everyone else thinks differently: Russians fear that America wants to cement its military superiority (and Russia's inferiority) forever; the Chinese are concerned that NMD signals American readiness to help Taiwan remain independent; Europeans worry that America's plans invite tensions with Russia and may separate the US from Europe. 
Because political intentions, not technical capabilities matter, NMD creates problems now: it pushes Russia into confrontation, heightens Chinese nervousness, and underpins a European sense of estrangement from the US. 
Damage is done from the word go while the end of the road remains obscured. 
Inflating this political damage is the fact that, thirty years ago, the US and the then Soviet Union renounced effective defense against strategic nuclear missiles. 
Normally, a US defense project in its infancy would not cause the excitement NMD generates. 
But the 1972 ABM Treaty prohibits, for the indefinite future, systems to protect either country against such nuclear attack. 
As the US proceeds with NMD, it will either have to violate the Treaty or give six months notice to quit, something both signatories are entitled to do if they feel their vital security interests demand it. 
In the eyes of many, that would amount to America opting out of the structure of nuclear arms control built in the latter part of the Cold War. 
The Bush Administration argues that, because the Cold War is over, the formal disappearance of the ABM Treaty would not mean a loss of nuclear stability. 
But stability is as much a matter of political perceptions as of technical calculations. 
By limiting strategic missile defense, the old treaty provides a certain predictability of deterrence for all nuclear weapon states. 
Its disappearance would affect all other arms control agreements. 
Russia threatens to scrap all of them once the US leaves the ABM-Treaty. 
While this threat lacks credibility (it would harm Russian interests most) it has a certain logic. 
The main question NMD poses is not how to prepare for a future world of missile defense but how to dampen today's political concerns. 
Such efforts are getting discretely underway. 
Legal experts in Washington suggest that modest preparations for building missile and radar sites do not violate the ABM-Treaty and so do not yet require a US notice to quit. 
For now, the Bush Administration will await the outcome of tests before deciding. 
Both Moscow and Washington hint at possible deep cuts in their offensive nuclear arsenals. 
Skeptical European allies are being mollified by US assurances of close consultation. 
The most important of confidence-building measures, a modification of the ABM-Treaty to allow for limited missile defense, is being explored. 
Russia's early "nyet" may not be the last word. 
So political turmoil with Russia and Europe might be calmed. 
But what about China? 
In contrast to Europe and Russia, China is not party to an alliance (as is Europe) or to a network of arms control treaties through which political solutions can evolve (like Russia), factors that contribute to Asian instabilities and Chinese sensitivity. 
Here confidence can only be built through the approach taken by the US to China. 
Regrettably, there are no indications yet that the problem is recognized in Washington as a serious one. 
All this comes as a disappointment to old Cold War strategists. 
While brushing up the vocabulary and abbreviations of the age of superpower deterrence, they discover that such a world has gone. 
Missile defense is not a threat to US-Russian strategic stability; its mishandling is a threat to political predictability. 
By announcing its determination to go ahead with a distant NMD, the US has created political turbulence which it must address now if major damage is to be avoided. 
The New Baby Boomers 
Alienated and unemployed youth are a concern everywhere. 
They pose a particular challenge in the developing world, where a demographic bulge equal to the great "baby boom" that occurred in the West at the end of World War II is growing. 
But the post-war era in the world's most developed countries was one of unprecedented prosperity for the baby boom generation, which is now nearing retirement. 
Will the future be as promising for the developing world's billion-plus young people between the ages of 12 and 24? 
Throughout the developing world, governments urgently need to devise the right mix of investments and policies to encourage their young people to get an education, find work, stay healthy, form families, and exercise citizenship. 
The payoff is huge if they get it right: accelerated development as economies reap the benefits of a burgeoning working-age population and lower dependency ratios. 
In East Asia, this "demographic dividend" is believed to have generated more than a quarter of the region's economic growth. 
Developing countries have already invested heavily in children. 
Their young people are therefore better-educated and healthier than previous generations. 
More than 80% of children now attend primary school, up from 50% in 1970, and infant mortality has fallen from more than 10% to 6.5% over the same period. 
But now governments must go beyond investments in children and begin supporting the new generation of young people. 
Indeed, even in countries with high primary-school completion rates, many young people do not attend secondary school. 
Young people account for half of all new HIV infections. 
And, in the Middle East and North Africa region, about a quarter of all young people are unemployed. 
These problems raise thorny questions: What prevents more young people from attending secondary school? 
Is it because they are sometimes close to being illiterate even after primary school, or because it is unaffordable? 
Why don't more young people learn how to lower the risk of getting HIV/AIDS? 
Why do businesses in these countries complain of a lack of skilled workers when so many university students are jobless? 
To build successful youth-friendly policies, governments need to focus on three policy areas: expanding opportunities, enhancing capabilities, and providing second chances for young people. 
Governments must broaden opportunities for young people by improving access to, and the quality of, health and educational services. 
We know that the full benefit of primary school is realized only when children go on to secondary school. 
Yet many young people are ill prepared for secondary school, and places are scarce. 
Today's employers want highly skilled workers. 
More than 20% of all firms, in countries as diverse as Algeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Estonia, and Zambia, rate inadequate skills and education of workers as a major or a severe obstacle. 
If young people are not to become stuck in dead-end jobs, or end up without jobs at all, they need better education and skills that match those needed by employers. 
Several countries now facilitate access to secondary schooling, in particular through "conditional cash transfer programs," which offer a stipend to poor families whose children regularly attend school. 
These programs have successfully increased secondary school enrollment in countries like Mexico, Ecuador, Bangladesh, and Cambodia. 
For these programs to work, however, children must be ready to enter secondary education. 
Yet, in Morocco, for example, more than 80% of school children complete primary school, but fewer than 20% have mastered the material. 
Second, policies should support young people as they strive to make good decisions. 
Governments cannot substitute for parents or for communities, but they can encourage young people and their families to invest in themselves. 
Armed with the right information and incentives, young people can make better decisions about their health and education. 
In Cameroon, Horizon Jeunes, a reproductive health program that targets urban youth, increased young people's knowledge of reproductive health and successfully changed their behavior, with condom use among females increasing from 58% to 76% in the treatment group. 
Similarly, the rate at which eighth graders from the Dominican Republic entered upper secondary levels increased when they were simply told how much more those who finished high school earned -- an amount they had vastly underestimated. 
Bangladesh's Female Secondary Stipend Program was successful in helping girls aged 11 to 14 to delay marriage and remain in school. 
Governments must also begin to offer "second chances" for young people who have fallen behind due to difficult circumstances or poor choices. 
Such programs must be well designed, targeted, and coordinated to give the right incentives to beneficiaries. 
For example, sub-Saharan Africa has thousands of young combatants -- 100,000 in Sudan alone -- who hope to reconstruct their lives in peacetime but clearly require skills training and jobs, as well as medical and psychological support. 
Focusing political will and the efforts of young people themselves to expand opportunities, enhance capabilities, and provide second chances can help countries make the most of today's demographic advantage. 
Countries can either harness this growth -- and in so doing, transform their development prospects -- or face the risk of an alienated generation embittered by the unfulfilled chance of a better future. 
Down with Euro-Paternalism 
Italy's presidency of the European Union bears an enormous responsibility, namely reinvigorating enlargement as the key aspect of the new EU. 
A good place to start would be to push for a different attitude on accession countries' adoption of the Euro. 
Indeed, EU institutions' current paternalistic stance towards the accession countries threatens to create a two-tier Europe that will complicate the task of integration. 
The accession countries have upheld their end of the bargain, achieving a degree of trade integration with EU countries that is even higher than many current members. 
Three of them--Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania--have currency boards or a fixed exchange rate with the Euro, as does Bulgaria, which is expected to enter the EU in 2007. 
The others have declared for several years their interest in adopting the Euro early on, in some cases unilaterally, even before entry into the EU--a position openly supported by the National Bank of Poland, and less forcefully by the National Bank of Hungary and the Czech National Bank. 
But, despite their progress in bringing their inflation and interest rates closer to EU levels, many candidate countries fear that with the full opening up to capital flows--a requirement of accession--they will be exposed to the risk of sudden stops in capital flows and currency crises. 
They have learned the lesson from Latin America and Asia in the 1990's. 
Adopting the Euro would give them a great way to escape such risks and focus on creating real growth in their economies. 
But the response from EU institutions, namely the European Central Bank and the European Commission, has been negative: candidate countries were told that they first must spend at least two years in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II), where Euro aspirants are expected to prove their policy mettle. 
Initially, even currency boards were considered unacceptable, although, as is often the case in Europe, exceptions were made: countries with currency boards could keep them after entry into the EU. 
The opposition of the ECB and the Commission to rapid Euro adoption lacks strong foundations. 
What should matter for the EU is that the policies of any member state are not harmful to other members. 
As Leszek Balcerowicz, the Governor of the National Bank of Poland, argues, adoption of the Euro by candidate countries will certainly create benefits for candidate countries, while in the worst case being neutral for current members. 
Indeed, the combined size of the candidate countries' economies is so small--around 6% of the enlarged EU's GDP--that they cannot possibly exert any significant effect on the Euro. 
But continuing opposition by EU institutions has led most candidate countries to abandon the idea of adopting the Euro unilaterally or as quickly as possible after entering the Union. 
Unfortunately, the stubbornness of the ECB and the European Commission is now providing ammunition to populist governments in accession countries that are counting on currency appreciation to escape the fiscal discipline that adopting the Euro would imply. 
However, such fiscal expansion would probably disqualify a country from entering the Euro any time soon. 
Indeed, the accession countries that have not implemented a currency board have seen their budget deficits surge--exceeding 9% of GDP in Hungary in 2002 and more than 5% in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia--while large capital inflows have kept their currencies under strong pressure to appreciate. 
This trend exposes candidate countries' real economies to precisely the risk of a capital flow reversal and currency crisis that early Euro adoption was meant to eliminate. 
It is ironic that the candidate countries are being lectured to by officials at the ECB and the European Commission on the trade-off between nominal and real convergence. 
The objective of growth for the accession countries is apparently the sole imperative in Brussels; macroeconomic stability can wait. 
Large budget deficits support growth, but inflation evidently is not a problem. 
If this line of thought sounds familiar, perhaps it is because it (more or less) recapitulates the foundations of the unsustainable planning system with which the accession countries broke at the beginning of the 1990's. 
It was, of course, the embrace of rational, market-driven economic policies by the former communist nations that has brought them to the brink of EU membership. 
So European institutions should abandon their paternalistic approach and take seriously the concerns of accession countries' central bankers about the risks of maintaining their own currencies for a long period during which their economies have to open up completely to capital flows. 
As it is, the ECB and the European Commission are de facto supporting the positions of populist governments in Eastern Europe that are already spending the funds they hope to get in the future from the EU. 
It is high time that EU institutions address more seriously the challenges and opportunities posed by enlargement. 
They can begin by viewing accession countries' early adoption of the Euro more favorably, both for countries with a currency board and for those with floating exchange rates. 
Blair's EU disaster 
When voters in France and the Netherlands turned down the proposal for a Constitution for the European Union, the world knew that the European project was in deep trouble. 
Last week's bruising battle over the medium-term future of the Union's budget has confirmed that verdict with a vengeance. 
It also brought to a sorry close the UK's six-month presidency of the European Council, confirming Britain's long-standing reputation as the odd-man-out in the European Union. 
The two events are intimately connected. 
French and Dutch voters did not say why they voted against the planned Constitution. 
But many commentators believe that they were protesting against what they perceived as the precipitate admission of ten new member states, mainly much poorer countries from Central and Eastern Europe. 
In particular, voters were afraid that their jobs would be lost to hordes of Eastern immigrants, exemplified in the image widely quoted at the time, of the low-cost Polish plumber. 
The irony, of course, was that most of the 15 old member states had refused to give the new members full and immediate access to the Western job markets. 
But in any event, it was too late to protest: the ten Eastern states had already been granted membership of the Union. 
But now the 25 member states must deal with the financial consequences of that enlargement, not just in the overall size of the European Union budget for the next seven years, but in who pays and who benefits. 
In particular, the central issue is how far the old member states are willing to pay to boost the less developed economies of the new members. 
In the event, it turned into a three-way battle between Britain, France and the new member states. 
Traditionally, a large majority of the budget has gone either on agriculture or on the development of backward regions. 
In practice, this has meant large flows of money either to big agricultural producers, like France, or to poorer member states, like Greece and Portugal. 
On both counts, the new member states expected to benefit substantially from the EU system. 
In the past, the big loser from the EU system, in budgetary terms, was the UK; for while agriculture accounted for two thirds of all EU spending, the UK had a small farm sector, and therefore received small farm payments. 
The British long complained of the unfairness of these rules, especially in view of the fact that the UK was one of the relatively poorer member states; and in 1984, Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government demanded, and got, a massive rebate on its net contribution to the EU budget. 
Today, the situation has changed in three important respects. 
EU farm policy has started to be reformed, and its share of the EU budget has fallen from over 60% to 40%; Britain has for several years enjoyed significantly faster economic growth than most other member states, so that it is now one of the richer EU countries, even compared with France and Germany; and the new member states are so much poorer than even the poorest of the old members, that they have an unanswerable moral case for a generous share of whatever budget could be negotiated. 
When negotiations started six months ago, it was Britain's turn to take over the Presidency of the European Council. 
Tony Blair, British Prime Minister, electrified the world of European politics by telling the European Parliament that he was a "passionate pro-European". 
This was a message for which Britain's European friends had long been hoping, and for which they had waited in vain since Blair's election in 1997. 
Certainly, he had never expressed any such sentiment inside the British Isles during the previous eight years. 
Since Britain had been one of the most insistent advocates of enlargement of the EU to the candidates from Central and Eastern Europe, one might have expected that the Blair government would have wished to be correspondingly generous to the new-comers in the conduct of the budgetary negotiations. 
At first, this seemed to be the British government's chosen tactic. 
Against all expectations, it struck a morally advantageous posture by offering to surrender some part of its budget rebate, but only if the rest of the European Union (i.e. France, in particular) would agree to fundamental reforms of EU farm policy. 
It took some time before the British came to understand that since President Jacques Chirac is a beleaguered lame-duck President, who will remain in office but not in power until 2007, he is in no position to agree to any such bargain. 
So when the British came to terms with this harsh reality, they played out the lamentable end-game of their management of the negotiations with small-minded cheese-paring and logic-chopping offers, all designed primarily to safeguard narrow British interests, mainly at the expense of the new member states. 
It is a sad conclusion to a presidency, launched six-months ago, with Blair's claim that he was a "passionate pro-European". 
Yet the full text of his speech tells it all. 
Blair is in favour of Europe; but not this Europe. 
He wants to be a part of a political Europe; but only if the other member states follow Britain's model of economic and social reform. 
The problem is that economic and social reform are purely national responsibilities, and do not lie within the competence of the Union; if there is to be economic and social reform in France and Germany, that is a matter exclusively for French and German voters and politicians. 
It could only be a European matter, if the EU were a real federation. 
Is Blair a federalist, then? 
Heavens, no! 
He is merely an unthinking nationalist, living in terror of the nationalist yellow tabloid press. 
So why does he say he is a passionate pro-European? 
Because he has not thought about the question for one moment. 
Europe's Neo-Liberal Challenge 
For over 20 years I have argued that Western Europe's high unemployment rates are unsustainable. 
At the end of the 1970's, monetarists bet that only a transitory and modest increase in unemployment could rein in the creeping -- and trotting -- inflation of the industrial west, and that in retrospect the cost of returning to effective price stability would be judged worthwhile. 
In Britain and the United States, this monetarist bet turned out well. 
In Western Europe, it did not. 
Over the past 25 years in Europe, unemployment rose as monetary policy was tightened and interest rates were raised to fight inflation. 
But after inflation succumbed, unemployment did not fall -- or not by much. 
If unemployment was not stuck quite at Great Depression levels, it remained high enough to make long-term joblessness or the fear of long-term joblessness a defining experience. 
Societies in which the official unemployment rate stands at 10% or more for generations are societies in which government economic management has failed. 
So, for 20 years it has seemed to me that Western Europe's underlying political equilibrium -- corporatist bargaining and ample social insurance, on the one hand, and tight monetary policies, on the other -- must crack. 
Twin fears appear to be paralyzing European policymakers. 
Europe's central bankers fear that their political masters will order them to loosen monetary policy, that the structural reforms needed to free up aggregate supply will not be forthcoming, and that the result will be a return to the inflation of the 1970's. 
In short, they fear that all of the sacrifices made for price stability will have been in vain. 
West European politicians, for their part, fear the opposite outcome. 
They worry that even after undertaking structural reforms to reduce the attractiveness of unemployment benefits and increase the ability of workers to move to jobs and of firms to move to workers, central bankers will continue to insist on tight money. 
In short, they fear that, with no expansion of output or employment, the net effect will simply be an increase in poverty. 
Of course, these fears are accompanied by the hope that structural reforms and monetary expansion work in harmony, boosting employment and output without raising inflation by much. 
But the reality is that steps toward looser monetary policies are non-existent -- especially with the fledgling European Central Bank anxious to establish its inflation-fighting credibility -- and that steps toward structural reforms are half-hearted, hesitant, and small. 
For 20 years, I have been wrong: West European polities have remained stable despite the exclusion of a large proportion of citizens from meaningful participation in much of economic life. 
West European economies have continued to grow -- albeit not as rapidly as they might have -- despite bearing the heavy burden of the unemployed 10% or more of the labor force. 
Now, though, it looks like I may finally be right -- or at least right to worry, if not to panic. 
The French rejected the European Union constitution, primarily -- or so it appears -- because further European integration, it is feared, must bring in its wake the huge costs and disruptions of neo-liberalism. 
It is one thing to back the "European project" when the idea is to bind Germany so tightly to France that never again will anybody think it worthwhile to wage a war over what language is spoken in Alsace-Lorraine. 
It is another when the European project means that French workers face competition from Polish plumbers, Romanian farmers, and Turkish shop clerks. 
In Germany, the electorate seems poised to eject Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder out of discontent with his tepid allegiance to the neo-liberal project. 
The problem is that the electorate will then get four years of rule by a chancellor, Angela Merkel, whose commitment to the neo-liberal project is almost as strong as mine. 
I think that Germany would be better off in a decade under more neo-liberal policies. 
But this does not seem to be what the German electorate wants, and this makes the complexion of German politics four years from now incalculable. 
Coupled with all this is northern European discontent with the central bankers, specifically with the ECB and the euro. 
It is not that the end of European Monetary Union is on the agenda; it is merely that people have begun thinking about possible low-probability futures in which the end of EMU might be placed on the agenda. 
That is enough to shake asset prices worldwide. 
Western Europe's accomplishments since World War II are among the most heartening and impressive success stories in world history. 
Everyone should want today's undivided Europe to build on these accomplishments, rather than for generations of high unemployment to jeopardize them. 
But this will require a shift in the ECB's attitude. 
Europe needs a monetary policy that views aiding employment growth in northern Europe as more important than continental price stability. 
There will, after all be inflation in southern and eastern Europe -- there must be, for as regions develop and industrialize their terms of trade must improve, and under a monetary union regional inflation is how this can happen. 
The ECB should not try to balance inflation in the south and east with deflation in the north in order to hit artificial continent-wide targets. 
Saved by Taxes 
What do we owe to our great-great-great-grandchildren? 
What actions are we obligated to take now in order to diminish the risks to our descendants and our planet from the increasing likelihood of global warming and climate change? 
Almost everyone -- except the likes of ExxonMobil, US Vice President Dick Cheney, and their paid servants and deluded acolytes -- understands that when humans burn hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere, where it acts like a giant blanket, absorbing infrared radiation coming up from below and warming the earth. 
Likewise, almost everyone understands that while global warming might be a much smaller or larger problem than existing models suggest, this uncertainty is no excuse for inaction. 
In fact, uncertainty about global climate change should lead us to do more to guard against it than if we knew it would proceed exactly according to the central-case projections. 
Finally, almost everyone agrees that governments, non-profit institutions, and energy companies should be spending far more to develop technologies that generate non-carbon-emitting power, that remove it from the atmosphere to forests or oceans, and that cool the earth by reflecting more of the sunlight that lands on it. 
Clearly, the world's rich countries should carry the burden of dealing with climate change over the next generations. 
After all, they could take an easy, emissions-intensive path to industrialization and wealth. 
Today, China, India, and other developing countries cannot, and it would be unfair to penalize them for that. 
So now is the time to build, not disrupt or impede, the international institutions that will manage our response to global climate change in the years ahead. 
But should we be doing anything else now and in the next decade? 
Economists like to think of things in terms of prices. 
And when economists see behavior that has destructive side effects, we like to tax it. 
Taxation makes individuals feel in their wallets the destruction they are causing. 
Imposing a tax on those who, say, drive low-mileage SUV's is a way of harnessing humanity's collective intelligence to decide when bad side effects are a reason to alter behavior. 
But it has to be the right tax. 
An SUV going ten miles in the city and burning a gallon of gasoline pumps about three kilograms of carbon into the atmosphere. 
Should the extra "global warming" tax be $0.05 a gallon, $0.50 a gallon, or $1.50 a gallon? 
Our views will change as we learn more, but at the moment the size of the tax hinges on a question of moral philosophy: how much do we believe we owe our distant descendents? 
The Australian economist John Quiggin has an illuminating discussion on his website ( 
On the other hand, critics point out that the world today is poor: average annual GDP per capita at purchasing power parity is roughly $7,000. 
We expect improved technology and its spread to make the world of 2100, at a 2% annual growth rate, much richer: $50,000 per capita of year-2006 purchasing power. 
So the critics argue that we need the marginal $70 per capita today much more than the richer people of 2100 will need the $500 that they would gain from being spared the effects of global climate change. 
But what the critics often don't say is that the same logic applies to the world today. 
Average annual per capita incomes in the US, Japan, and Western Europe are currently around $40,000, and less than $6,000 for the poorer half of the world's population. 
The same logic that says we need our $70 more than the people of 2100 need an extra $500 dictates that we should tax the world's rich more, as long as each extra $500 in first-world taxes generates as little as an extra $70 in poor countries per capita incomes. 
In short, if the world's rich are stingy today toward our much richer descendants, and if we want to leave our environmental mess to them to deal with, we should be lavish toward the world's poor. 
Likewise, if we are stingy today toward the world's poor, we should be lavish toward our descendents. 
At least, that is what we should do, if our actions are based on some moral principle, rather than that of Leonid Brezhnev: what we have, we hold. 
Taking Drug Safety Seriously 
Health hazards -- nuclear reactors, guns, and contaminated foods -- surround all of us, so governments take an active role in limiting these hazards through regulations, which, in many cases, are very successful. 
But the situation is far different concerning the safety of prescription drugs. 
Indeed, as far as protecting the public is concerned, drug safety is the regulator's neglected stepchild. 
The magnitude of the problem is huge. 
In the United States alone, it is estimated that every year up to 100,000 patients die due to serious adverse drug reactions (ADR's). 
If true, drug-induced death would qualify as the fourth or fifth leading cause of death (depending on which mortality estimates are used). 
Moreover, the direct annual hospital costs attributable to ADR's run into the billions of dollars, and this does not include all the suffering that ADR's cause that does not lead to hospitalization (or death). 
The difficulties in determining cause and effect must be acknowledged. 
Whether a patient's death or hospitalization is due to a particular drug, the underlying illness, or a combination of the two can be hard to determine. 
But this makes drug safety all the more important. 
Inherent to drug safety is the fact that all drugs, in addition to their benefits, cause harm in certain patients. 
Drug approval and use requires a careful weighing of desirable and undesirable effects. 
These judgments vary, depending on whether they are made by a drug company, which stands to benefit from sales, or a patient at risk of suffering a serious adverse effect. 
Incomplete knowledge complicates this assessment. 
The rush to get new drugs to market often leads to inadequate safety documentation. 
More than half of all approved drugs produce a serious adverse reaction that is not known at the time of regulatory approval. 
For example, when the new class of painkillers called Cox-2 inhibitors was introduced, regulators, physicians, and patients were unaware that these drugs could cause heart attacks and strokes. 
Tens of thousands of innocent patients -- perhaps more -- suffered such ADR's before the first two drugs of this class were withdrawn. 
Proper and complete documentation of harmful drug effects is difficult. 
Spontaneous reporting rates to regulatory agencies are low -- approximately 1% -- and ongoing monitoring is passive in many countries. 
There is also a general reluctance to report unfavorable drug effects. 
Physicians may feel guilty and fear litigation, drug companies worry about the threat to corporate profits and regulatory agencies must face the question: "Why was the drug approved in the first place?" 
It is especially difficult to attribute an adverse reaction to a drug if the medical event is common in the user's age group or in the condition being treated. 
Because the risk of heart attacks is high in older people, many of whom have arthritic pain requiring treatment with painkillers, it took six years to link Cox-2 inhibitors to a two- to three-fold increase in the risk of heart attacks. 
A recent Harris Survey in the US concluded that 60% of adults are either not confident at all or not very confident that drug makers will publicly and in a timely manner disclose data on their products' adverse effects. 
Their skepticism is hardly groundless: internal documents obtained in recent lawsuits reveal that drug companies often fail to submit critical safety information to regulatory agencies, as required by law, and fail to communicate such information to physicians and patients. 
One problem is that the consequences for neglecting drug safety are non-existing or minimal. 
The time has come to get serious: 
· Citizens and government must make drug safety a priority and commit adequate resources to fixing the problems; 
· Penalties for drug companies' failure to report and communicate safety information must be increased dramatically if they are to serve as effective deterrents; 
· Regulatory agencies need enforcement authority so that stricter rules can be implemented; 
· The drug-safety problem must be seen as a systemic failure. 
It is unfair to blame clinicians for serious ADR's, particularly in the absence of complete safety information. 
Fixing the problem requires full cooperation from clinicians, but this requires ending their fear of litigation. 
This approach works well in the airline industry: pilots reporting near misses are not penalized; 
· Patients need to be better informed about the risks of prescription drugs and more involved in detection and reporting. 
Package inserts in fine print are useless; 
· Monitoring of ADR's must be more pro-active. 
This requires more funding, which should come from the main beneficiary of drug sales -- the pharmaceutical industry -- just as oversight of aviation safety is funded by the airlines. 
Above all, the success of any comprehensive effort to improve drug safety hinges upon establishing an independent office of drug safety to advocate, coordinate, and provide direction to the regulatory agenda. 
Such an office exists in the United Kingdom. 
Other governments should follow this model in order to fulfill their neglected role as guardian of public health. 
The Virtual Enemy 
Five years have passed since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington of September, 2001, yet it seems that policymakers have learned little about how terrorist cells operate, and what their weaknesses are. 
The Bush administration still uses the phrase "war on terror" and behaves as though it really is a war, the ordinary kind where one government fights another. 
Yet after five years of military exertions, strategies based on targeting a united aggressor have only made the situation worse. 
It is time to understand the new, emerging model of conflict. 
In order to make the "war" paradigm fit, the Bush administration alludes to al-Qaeda as a centrally directed enemy. 
In fact, there is now no master planner or funder of terrorist activities. 
The Madrid, London, and Bali attacks, as well as several thwarted operations in the United States and Britain, were all characterized by their dispersed organization. 
Independently generated plots emerged and used ad hoc resources, often within the target country. 
Those small operations also lacked a common internal design. 
Terrorist motivations differ from cell to cell, even from person to person. 
Individuals can be involved for profit and power, or for political and religious reasons, while others participate for hate or thrills. 
Moreover, there are vast differences in terms of risks, rewards, and imperatives as one moves up the organizational chain, or jumps from cell to cell. 
Conventional military models are geared to decapitate something that, in this case, has no head. 
The characteristics of this new structure have already been studied in a very different context. 
Terrorism is a violent version of an "agile virtual enterprise." 
A virtual enterprise is any small group that self-assembles into an organization that is just large enough to accomplish the collective intention. 
Virtual enterprises are unusually innovative, and, in the business sector, they are possibly the only system that can build a one-off product well. 
A conspicuous example already exists in the movie production industry. 
In fact, they are probably the commercial model of the future. 
The benefits of virtual enterprises stem from their lightness over stability. 
At present, most of the price of any product supports the huge, inefficient organization that assembled it. 
Nearly all the creativity and problem solving occurs in small companies and is later "integrated" by mega-corporations, which have an expensive and vulnerable infrastructure, and keep most of the profit. 
This model is the current basis of the business world, just as centralization has also been the favored defense strategy. 
When you buy a car from General Motors, 80 cents from each dollar goes to GM, which mostly only manages itself. 
The small suppliers actually provide you with 80% of the value and innovation but only receive 20% of the reward. 
Ironically, extensive research into alternative models was funded through the US Department of Defense, which, as the world's largest buyer of complex machinery, wanted better, cheaper and more tailored goods. 
The research noted the conditions and triggers needed to facilitate the self-assembly of small opportunistic groups and enable them to act like large companies. 
Unfortunately, the research program was cancelled before its findings could be applied in the business world, almost certainly because it threatened large companies. 
It is often forgotten that US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld emerged from a comfortable retirement to reorganize the American military into a smaller, more agile force, using some of these same insights. 
But the planning for the Iraq invasion, in which Rumsfeld advocated the use of fewer troops than advised, suggests a poor understanding of distributed systems. 
While the forces were deployed for a flexible entry and withdrawal, the Bush administration ended up using them for an old-fashioned occupation. 
Terrorists have been better at capitalizing on models of distributed operation. 
Scores of texts are appearing in the Muslim world on jihadi strategic studies. 
The best known in the West is The Management of Savagery , but only because it was translated and made public. 
These books (and the trends they indicate) are becoming less dogmatic and increasingly sophisticated in the adoption of modern management techniques. 
Their research surely includes the young science of virtual enterprise management: how to nurture and support self-organizing cells. 
Perhaps the first lesson for Western policymakers is that virtual enterprises run on a culture of trust. 
Some kinds of trust can be based on an artificial notion of "not us" rather than on real values and direct experience. 
That is why the Bush administration's actions actually strengthen the virtual terrorist enterprise dynamic. 
Bush's "us and them" rhetoric clearly defines an "other" and positions it as a cohesive enemy. 
His "war" approach is making it easier for Islamist terrorists to view the West as an equally united and malevolent force. 
In the future, the virtual enterprise model will shape how business is conducted, wars will be fought and probably how government services will be administered. 
It promises to decouple the management of finance from that of production, implying faster innovation and economic growth. 
However, if Western governments do not develop a deep understanding of how these structures operate, they stand no chance of combating the agile terrorist enterprise. 
Expansion is Solidarity 
Nowadays it is often alleged that the European Union's sense of solidarity was put in jeopardy, if not shattered outright, by its enlargement to take in the countries of central and eastern Europe. 
As Bulgaria and Romania come closer to membership, and with accession talks with Turkey and Croatia set to begin, it has become increasingly important to challenge that view. 
The values and interests of the EU's newest member states coincide in most ways with those of the 15 earlier members. 
It is, of course, true that enlargement has fundamentally changed the Union and given rise to new problems and policy concerns. 
But the new member states in central and eastern Europe are deeply embedded in the economic, social, and cultural development of our Continent. 
The ties that bind us together were frayed by forty years of Soviet domination, but this did not fundamentally change these states' European character. 
My country, Poland, has always had deep cultural ties to other European countries, especially France. 
We participated in all the major developments in European music, literature, and film (think of Andrzej Wajda's films from the Solidarity era, such as "Danton," which were French co-productions). 
Even in sport, East Europeans have long been integrated with the rest of Europe. 
Indeed, before World War I the German national football team consisted entirely of players with Polish names. 
But, above all, there is a deep sense among Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, and others, that they are Europeans. 
This is the very meaning of the word "solidarity," as defined in the Oxford English Dictionary: "unity resulting from feelings and sympathies." 
Solidarity, in the sense of unity resulting from common interests, also clearly exists within both the original EU-15 and the enlarged Union. 
The exceptions prove the rule. 
The EU's disunity over the war in Iraq should not overshadow its member states' agreement on almost all other great questions of international affairs. 
In economic matters, disagreements on, say, a single EU regulation should not be allowed to mask the fact that no member state, new or old, has ever contested the internal market. 
Finally, the enlargement process itself is also manifestly a symbol of European social, civic, and cultural unity. 
The fact that it provoked debate and dispute does not detract from the conviction shared by old and new member states that they had an obligation to rebuild the Continent after 40 years of division. 
But there are concerns that, if not fundamentally divisive, are worrying. 
Should we fear the fact that Europe is no longer a purely Jewish/Christian and white continent? 
Will EU citizens whose origins are in other continents and whose religion is Hindu or Islam, Sikh or Buddhist, be able to identify with "European" values and culture? 
Will they be able to feel European, like the Poles or the Czechs have always felt? 
These questions apply most pointedly -- indeed, they cannot be avoided -- in the case of Turkey's possible accession to the EU. 
Is European integration animated by respect for another's values? 
Is it about sharing them or about contributing to them? 
These are obviously knotty questions. 
They are particularly difficult if we see culture as the cement of Europe's future. 
All European countries probably believed at the outset that non-European newcomers could be assimilated in the same way that Polish immigrants were assimilated into Germany's Ruhr region in the nineteenth century. 
That this has not happened, at least on a large scale, is not to say that it cannot happen at all. 
Look at the growing number of prominent citizens of Turkish origin in Germany. 
Consider the many second generation Indian and Pakistani Britons who are now seen in business suits carrying laptop computers and flying around the world. 
But Europeans must admit that these individuals represent a small minority. 
Many immigrant groups in Europe find themselves flung back on their own communities by the impossibility of social and economic integration. 
The constant threat of terrorism has made this isolation even more dramatic for the Europe's Islamic populations. 
The EU cannot simply proclaim "solidarity" as a core value and then do nothing to foster it among those who feel marginalized. 
They, too, must be allowed to feel those ties of "unity resulting from feelings and sympathy." 
European solidarity cannot and will not survive their neglect. 
After Kyoto 
The Kyoto Protocol treaty has now entered into force for the 126 nations who have joined it so far. 
Now is the time to start thinking about how to engage all nations, including large emitters, in conversations about what to do after the treaty's expiration in 2012. 
This is exactly what the European Commission did recently by providing its first strategy for a post-Kyoto era, which will be discussed by the European Council next March. 
While the Kyoto Protocol represents only a modest reduction of carbon emissions in industrialized countries -- 5.2% between 2008-2012 relative to 1990 levels, with varying targets for individual countries -- real progress can be made in sustaining development efforts and preserving our planet. 
But first, all countries must integrate climate concerns into policy planning, and improve their governance in key sectors such as energy, infrastructure, and transport. 
In other words, we must act in accordance with the recognition that climate change and its effects on people in both rich and poor countries remains a threat to global security. 
At the end of the day, the long-term approach is likely to include a rules-based system, an incentives system, and investments in technology change. 
Increasingly, adaptation at the national level will be recognized as a major issue that will require appropriate funding. 
Dealing with the impacts of climate change and with emission reductions should not be mutually exclusive, but complementary. 
Looking ahead to the post-Kyoto world offers us the chance to start a new dialogue and to look at new options on climate change. 
Nations could set the more ambitious goal of limiting the long-term change in the earth's temperature, and then assign emissions rights among countries in such a way that will eventually limit temperature increases to an acceptable level. 
This would require increasing investments in energy research and development for new and improved technologies -- a process that needs to be supported by stronger public-private partnerships. 
Up to now, with only 15% of the world's population, rich countries have been responsible for more than 75% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and thus most of the environmental damage. 
However, it is the developing countries -- and thus the world's poor -- who are most vulnerable. 
It is unrealistic to ask poor countries, where more than 1.6 billion people do not have access to clean energy and technologies, to bear the costs associated with the much needed technological change. 
Working with partners, the World Bank is supporting financial strategies to assist developing countries in meeting the costs caused by climate change. 
To date, over $1 billion dollars in Global Environment Facility (GEF) grants, together with about $8 billion in co-financing, have been committed to programs related to climate change. 
While the regulatory mechanisms of both Kyoto and the European Trading Scheme have contributed to the establishment of an emerging market for carbon trading, interested parties are now concerned about the immediate future. 
Without a regulatory framework beyond 2012, the window of opportunity for initiating project-based transactions will close by 2006/2007. 
Given the long lead time between project preparation and the first benefits of emissions reductions, project developers have only a few years to act before carbon payments cease to make a meaningful contribution to project finance in the current context. 
Developing infrastructure projects is a long process that requires 3-7 years from identification, through licensing, financing, and construction, and finally to the first certification of carbon emission reductions. 
Therefore, projects need to be operational at the latest by 2007. 
The World Bank has been instrumental in advancing carbon finance as a viable development tool, and in facilitating private-sector participation in the market. 
The Bank is focused on representing the interests of its borrowing countries, helping them to develop assets for carbon trading according to their own priorities. 
But, without a commitment by governments to limit greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2012, the carbon market will remain uncertain, and the private sector -- vital to the market's success -- is unlikely to expand its participation in a meaningful and sustained way. 
According to a recent World Bank-supported survey of companies interested in carbon finance, only one in five respondents declared that they were interested in buying post-2012 emissions reductions. 
Now is the chance to look forward and enlist the global community -- with no exclusions, although with differentiated responsibilities -- in the pursuit of a more secure world, one that avoids the dire risks of environmental degradation and social conflict implied by inaction. 
State of the Art, or Art of the State? 
September is traditionally the time when opera companies and orchestras return to their home cities from Aix, Salzburg, Tanglewood, and countless other summer festivals. 
This rentrée is also marked (on both sides of the Atlantic) by the return of worries about how classical music is financed. 
American symphonic life is Euro-centric in almost every respect except for its funding. 
Whereas Americans depend upon tax-deductible private donations and box office receipts to finance live classical music, Europeans prefer direct government support for the arts. 
Ironically, while arts advocates in the United States have long argued for adoption of the "European model" -- which has produced a rich and varied artistic life for Europeans -- Europe is being forced to change its system of support to one that depends more on private money and the box office. 
Unfortunately, Europe's system of direct government financial support is falling victim to Europe's slow economic growth and budget deficits. 
Particularly for those countries that have adopted the euro, government spending on the arts will be constrained for some time by the requirement that fiscal deficits be kept to 3% of GDP. 
The resulting pressure on Europe's performing arts institutions is causing concern at various different levels. 
Traditionally, Europe's social democracies have preferred allocating scarce goods and services like concerts and operas by queues (financed by huge subsidies to keep prices low) rather than by willingness to pay. 
Now, this will change. 
Performing arts advocates in Europe point to the US where, among other things, music directors of even major orchestras are now expected to fully participate in fundraising activities and be active in the local community on the orchestras behalf. 
The same thing, they fear, will happen in Europe. 
Some conductors, not wanting to carry a tin cup as they wave their batons, have rejected important posts in the US for this reason, feeling that it would interfere with their art. 
Daniel Barenboim is rumored to have left the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in part because he objected to the fundraising demands that were being made of him. 
But US experience shows that getting artistic leaders like orchestra music directors to participate in fundraising need not be bad for the artistic side of the job. 
Michael Tilson Thomas in San Francisco, for example, has combined effective fundraising and artistic leadership to propel the San Francisco Symphony to the top rank of US orchestras. 
It also should be reassuring to Europeans who are concerned that greater reliance on private money necessarily means conservative programming that the San Francisco Symphony has one of the most adventuresome repertoires in the US. 
If the audience has progressive tastes, private money and innovative programming are entirely compatible. 
A corollary is that public money makes it possible for adventuresome programming even if audience tastes run to the conservative side. 
This is one reason performing artists in Europe like public money -- it liberates them from a diet of only Beethoven and Mozart. 
Moreover, the audience may come to appreciate an adventuresome repertoire the more it becomes exposed to it. 
Of course, with reduced public spending on the performing arts, not only will there be greater reliance on private money, but ticket prices will have to rise as well. 
Some argue that this is a bad thing, because they prefer queuing to the price system and fear that higher prices will compromise future audiences by excluding young people. 
But cheap prices for the performing arts do not solve the thorny problem of access for youth. 
First, youth may not take advantage of cheap tickets to the extent that they are not interested in going to hear live classical music at any price. 
Second, even if they do want to go, they may not be able to get seats, which often are not available because subscriptions stay in the same hands year after year. 
What good are cheap prices, which serve mainly to subsidize the same subscription holders, if there are no seats? 
If a taste for classical music is to be subsidized, some more targeted subsidies should be preferred to cheap prices. 
The best way to bring youth to the performing arts is through education. 
Because American orchestras can't count on schools or government to provide the basic music education necessary to ensure a continuing audience for classical music, some orchestras are doing it themselves with private money. 
In San Francisco, for example, the Symphony runs a $23 million privately funded project -- called Keeping Score -- that includes a national public television series, radio shows, interactive music learning, and school music programs. 
This type of innovative program is relevant for European as well as American orchestras. 
The problem of youth and access to the performing arts exists on both sides of the Atlantic. 
So does poor music education in state schools. 
If orchestras don't look after their own futures, they may well not have one to look after. 
Law and Order, Russian-Style 
Around the world, people worry that political freedom is disappearing in Vladimir Putin's Russia. 
Indeed, about the only people who are unconcerned about creeping authoritarianism in Russia are the Russians themselves. 
Russians seem to care less about political freedom than they do about social welfare - pensions, domestic violence, children's rights, or police brutality. 
In fact, most Russians are indifferent to the government's efforts to curtail press freedom and limit the right to protest. 
Such apathy makes my task as Russia's ombudsman, an office charged by the State Duma (parliament) with protecting political rights in Russia, difficult, if not impossible. 
The ombudsman acts as a bridge between the authorities and the people, seeking to resolve conflicts that arise between state bodies and citizens. 
My office is open not only to Russian citizens, but to foreigners and stateless people who feel their political rights have been compromised. 
The standards we apply are not only those contained in Russia's constitution, but also international legal principles and human rights norms, even if they sometimes contradict our constitution. 
For example, as ombudsman, I was opposed to curtailing the right of Russians to jury trials. 
Those who wanted to limit the use of juries supposedly feared a risk to state security in some instances. 
My office worked closely with the state to assure that, in most cases, juries are used. 
Similarly, my office defended the liberal weekly newspaper Novoe Vremya (New Times), which was being pressured by Moscow's city government on the pretext of a commercial dispute about a lease. 
That fight is not over, but after my intervention, Moscow's authorities must take into account the public's negative attitude to their effort to quash this publication. 
Of course, Russia provides far more headline-grabbling examples of political and human rights problems, such as the low-grade war in Chechnya or the Yukos affair. 
My office pays maximum attention to Chechnya, although this is not easy to do from Moscow. 
Indeed, I could spend all my time in Chechnya, but Russia has 89 regions with countless human rights issues to address. 
This is why I suggested to Putin that Chechnya have its own regional rights ombudsman who would spend all his time there. 
The new Chechen authorities seem to welcome this prospect. 
As to the Yukos affair, my office cannot intervene in any legal process until it is completed. 
Former Yukos CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky's lawyers have sent a complaint to the European Court for Human Rights in Strasbourg. 
If Khodorkovsky disagrees with the final decision of the Russian courts, he will undoubtedly appeal to that court. 
Only then will I be able to express an opinion. 
Many observers nonetheless insist that those under criminal investigation should be released on bail instead of being kept in prison. 
Others say that this is not an option in Khodorkovsky's case - being very rich, he could easily jump bail and flee abroad. 
In fact, this is precisely what happened with other figures accused in the Yukos case. 
All of these serious human rights questions expose the fact that Russia's legal institutions remains half-formed. 
For example, the Duma has taken far too long to enact a law on lobbying, which in most developed democracies clearly defines what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable behavior. 
Khodorkovsky might not be in as much trouble if such precise laws existed. 
Unformed laws are directly related to unformed ideas. 
Human rights in Russia are often violated simply because people are not aware that they have some particular right. 
The most important strategic goal of my office is that people learn how to defend their rights better, and to make the authorities take the complaints of ordinary Russians into consideration. 
Sadly, most bureaucrats still look upon human rights values with disdain. 
But the real problem for my office is neither ignorance nor legal infirmity, it is that in an under-developed legal system such as Russia's, my authority is mostly personal, and requires help from the mass media. 
Because concepts of human rights remain rudimentary, the best that can be hoped for is that awareness will slowly begin to take hold. 
My tactical goal is thus to raise the public profile of the ombudsman's office, in order to win more respect and recognition by both citizens and the state. 
This will be all but impossible without cooperation with non-governmental human rights organizations in Russia. 
Indeed, I view one of my tasks as being to facilitate contacts between these groups and the authorities. 
The government's response to these efforts will be an important indicator of whether and to what extent Putin's administration intends to include human and political rights within its so-called "dictatorship of law." 
The Revolutionary Conservative Pope 
Twenty-five years ago, Poland's people were stunned by the choice of their compatriot, Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Cracow, as Pope. 
Some were frightened, others wept with joy. 
Here, said a prominent writer, was "Poland's second baptism." 
But even in our euphoria, we did not expect how much the new Pope would change not only Poland, but the world. 
His first return visit to his native country soon afterwards showed to all the world the new Pope's power. 
Communist police disappeared from the main streets of Warsaw, yet the streets became models of order. 
After decades of disempowerment, Poles suddenly regained their capacity for self-determination. 
In saying aloud that "there can be no just Europe without an independent Poland on its map," the Pope effectively swept away the unjust postwar settlement that had subjugated Poland to Soviet power. 
Then, in Auschwitz, the Pope said: "I speak in the name of everyone whose rights go unrecognized and violated anywhere in the world, I speak because I am bound, we are all bound, by truth." 
On that spot, that Golgotha of modern times, he called the Poles, who remembered dear ones gassed to death in Auschwitz's crematoria as well as those frozen into glass in Siberia's concentration camps, to a brotherhood devoted to struggle against even justified hatred and revenge. 
Some see in the Pope the person responsible for a religious revival; others see a man of peace. 
Some see a defender of the poor, others a critic of liberation theology. 
For the people of Poland, John Paul II, by making human rights the central subject of his teaching, will forever be the man who gave us courage and hope, who restored our historical identity. 
Indeed, the central feature of the first decade of the Pope's reign was his struggle against dictatorship--Communist dictatorship in particular. 
The strategy formulated by the Pope for the Catholic Church, and his ability to mobilize millions of believers in its cause, meant that no one could ever again repeat Stalin's question: "How many divisions does the Pope have?" 
John Paul II demonstrated that moral force was a weapon potent enough to undo Yalta's division of the world. 
Perhaps in part because of their strong anticommunist stance, the Polish Church and John Paul II are often branded as "conservative." 
The accusation is meant to suggest that the Church cannot live comfortably with a pluralist democracy. 
To be sure, in the struggle against Communism, the Polish Church was, indeed, conservative--and thank God for that! 
It was conservative in its absolute fidelity to evangelical values, to the truth of faith, to its historical identity. 
For the system of official atheism and legalized mendacity, the Church was a living rebuke. 
With Communism gone, however, the problem confronted by John Paul II and his Church today is this: in what language can evangelical values be articulated in a world where evil is not incarnated in a political system but is diffused in individual souls? 
What is the Pope's message for the postcommunist world he helped create? 
John Paul II undoubtedly keeps a distance from liberal economic ideas and the liberal state, which he often charges with permissiveness and moral relativism. 
A critique of individualism in the name of collective values occurs frequently in the Pope's pronouncements. 
He sees the failings of liberalism as particularly pernicious in postcommunist countries. 
The market economy, despite its practical achievements, seems to him oftentimes to lack a heart and a human face. 
He sees the market as favoring entrepreneurship over human solidarity. 
So John Paul II is no enthusiast of modern Western civilization, with its divorce from the world of values, and he contrasts with it the moral sensitivity of societies with fresh memories of decades of dictatorship. 
Like Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the Pope tends to believe that it was above all in resistance to totalitarianism that man could become truly free and preserve the fundamental values of civilization. 
I confess that I view the heritage of Communism with more skepticism. 
Totalitarian pressure did, indeed, form exceptional people such as John Paul II and Alexander Solzhenitsyn, people for whom religious faith bought freedom from mendacity and solitude. 
But it did the same for Andrei Sakharov and Vaclav Havel, who defended their supreme values with reference to, and in the language of, lay humanism. 
For most people, however, life under totalitarian dictatorship was not ennobling; it was, rather, a daily immersion in lies, spiritual depravity, and material corruption. 
This is why postcommunist societies do not demonstrate any nobility or disinterestedness that seriously contrasts with the West. 
Communism's defeat left a huge black hole in communities' souls, which is now being filled with nationalism, bigotry, and Western consumerism. 
But John Paul II's basic intuition is correct: the postcommunist world--East and West--is in spiritual crisis, and the Pope wants to shake it into realizing the importance of higher values. 
Indeed, by his words and example, the Pope disrupts the world: it wants to live in wealth and comfort; he reminds us that we must also live in dignity. 
In the end, John Paul II does not fit neatly into any category and often represents a meeting of opposites: rejection of compromise with ecumenism, toughness with warmth, intellectual openness with insistence on theological orthodoxy. 
He is a conservative who loves freedom and a "peacemonger" who condemns injustice, but who reminds us that mercy is more important than justice. 
In this, he personifies the paradox that is Christianity: unbreakable and lasting principles joined by understanding and tolerance. 
Twenty-five years after John Paul II left Poland for Rome, we Poles remain grateful to him for having helped us regain our freedom. 
It is good that John Paul II is among us. 
A world where everything changes needs a guardian of what remains the same. 
The Intervention Syndrome 
Kosovo is often held up as a test case for the concept of "humanitarian" intervention. 
But as Iraq spirals into chaos, diplomats and leaders everywhere are again asking themselves if it is ever appropriate for alliances of nations or the international community as a whole to intervene when a sovereign country appears unable or unwilling to defend its citizens from genocide, war crimes, or ethnic cleansing. 
At the center of this debate is the so-called doctrine of the "responsibility to protect." 
As the United Nations-appointed Ombudsperson in Kosovo for the past five years, I have had the unique opportunity to observe the aftereffects of that doctrine following NATO's intervention in the former Yugoslavia in 1999. 
Kosovo has subsequently become an international experiment in society building, led by the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). 
Experiment is the right word here. 
Indeed, Kosovo has become a Petri dish for international intervention. 
Having lived and worked long enough in Kosovo to see the outcome so far, I contend that such experiments require further research. 
Clearly, the need for international intervention in crises is often time-specific and a fairly swift response is frequently required. 
However, apart from military factors, where such intervention is being considered, it is of vital importance to focus international policy discussion on the rapid deployment of a linked civilian and security presence. 
This is especially true where human suffering is caused by communal conflict, as was the case in Kosovo. 
An immediate deployment of an adequate civilian and security presence during the months immediately after the end of the 1999 NATO bombing campaign might well have provided suitable protective mechanisms against the backlash that allowed victims to become victimizers. 
NATO peacekeeping troops were not directed to stop the abductions, disappearances, retaliation killings, and massive property destruction by groups of ethnic Albanians, which led to a vast reverse ethnic cleansing of the non-Albanian (mainly Serb) population. 
As a result of this neglect, a noxious social and political residue pervades today's Kosovo. 
Instead of cooling communal conflict, interethnic hatred remains as heated as ever. 
In addition to the lack of an adequate civilian and security presence to reassure every community of its safety, the overall lack of legal mechanisms to deliver swift justice for crimes committed during and after the intervention created additional tension. 
So pervasive is this tension, in fact, that any chance of even beginning the much-needed reconciliation process must now be pushed far into the future. 
Similarly, in Kosovo the international community has devoted little time to helping former combatants contemplate their collective responsibility for atrocities, no matter how direct or indirect their personal involvement. 
Without such an effort, attempting to improve the situation is like building a house on a sand dune. 
This lack of foresight about and planning for the aftermath of armed intervention is not only dangerous to the people who have ostensibly been "saved"; it is counterproductive. 
Unless a humanitarian intervention is structured in such a way that it guarantees basic security, the underlying antagonisms that inspired the intervention in the first place will merely be reinforced, not diminished. 
So, six years after NATO's intervention, Kosovo seems as far from stability and social peace as ever. 
Despite the frequent assurances of UN authorities that Kosovo is on a path toward reconciliation and true home rule, NATO officials indicate that there are plans to maintain a long-term military presence in the province in order to "guarantee that the political process will be concluded successfully." 
This brings me to another key point: a workable exit strategy is just as important to the success of any future humanitarian intervention as the entry strategy. 
If an international intervention is to have any credible chance of success, clear criteria for what constitutes "success" are needed from the start. 
Only such clarity can allow for a proper end to international actors' engagement. 
In Kosovo, such clarity is and has been absent; as a result, NATO and the UN have no clear idea about when and how both should leave. 
Someone once rightly said that it is easy to bomb, but much harder to build; it is relatively easy to defeat a regime militarily, but it is far more difficult to create a solid, sustainable, civil society in its place. 
The UN General Assembly should keep this in mind as it starts to codify the doctrine of the "responsibility to protect." 
Central Europe's Fractious Right 
Is Eastern Europe's political pendulum about to run down? 
Across Central Europe since 1989, elections have oscillated between right and left. 
Is Hungary's slick young prime minister, Viktor Orban, poised to end all that? 
A ruthless program to absorb his political rivals on the right has helped Orban's FIDESZ party become nearly equal in size to his Socialist rivals on the left. 
Moreover, infighting among the Socialists has dented one of their biggest political advantages: the hard-headed discipline and political professionalism inherited from their Communist days. 
Premier Orban's semi-successful efforts to unify the right under the banner of FIDESZ are unique among Eastern Europe's fractured and fractious rightist parties. 
Since Communism's fall, center right parties in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia have suffered from disunity and a lack of vision. 
Despite the fact the region is still recovering from decades of communist mismanagement, the political right's fragmentation helped the political left, in some cases represented by former Communists, to win democratic elections regularly. 
Some problems faced by Central Europe's right are similar to those the political right faces elsewhere in Europe, where social democratic parties expropriated many formerly liberal ideas to seize a monopoly of the political center. 
In Central Europe this effect has been amplified by the fact that, regardless of ideological leanings, rulings parties have had to privatize the economy and, under pressure from the European Union, introduce reform measures that would, in a classical Western system, usually be undertaken by the political right. 
Leftist parties in various Central European countries, indeed, have often turned out to be more successful in reforming because they, paradoxically, have greater legitimacy in this respect. 
Many people believe that the Socialists would not privatize the economy or slash welfare systems if such measures were not absolutely necessary. 
The most serious problem of Central Europe's political right is a lack of identity. 
Although right-of-center politicians in Central European countries formally embrace traditional ideologies, for example, liberalism or conservatism, their electorates, unfamiliar with Western political philosophies, do not always understand the real meaning of those terms. 
In various surveys, significant segments of Central European electorates describe themselves as ``rightist,'' but years of communist paternalism pushed the region's political center of gravity firmly to the left. 
A person may describe him or herself as, for example, a liberal, yet at same time demand that the government continue subsidizing energy, education, or housing. 
Under the communist regimes, ideologies became totally instrumental. 
As during those years, many people now formally accept ideological labels but identify with them only as long as such an allegiance to a specific political current has tangible short-term benefits for them. 
One consequence of this cynical treatment of political ideologies is the wild swings in voters' preferences seen in various Central European countries. 
The problem of identity is made even worse by the fact that most Central European nations, where nation-building was retarded by Communism, easily succumb to nationalist sentiments that in turn are misused by some politicians. 
Although such politicians often describe themselves as ``rightist,'' their real policies, such as, for, example, those of former Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, are in fact demagogic populist or authoritarian. 
The situation of the political right in each Central European country is also influenced by experiences that are rooted in history and tradition. 
Political developments in Czechoslovakia during the last 20 years of communism set the Czech Republic and Slovakia apart from both Poland and Hungary. 
While both the Polish and Hungarian communist parties experienced internal liberalization that allowed relatively large semi-official zones of activity outside communist control, Czechoslovakia after the Soviet-led invasion of 1968 became a rigid neo-Stalinist regime. 
When the communist regimes collapsed in 1989, the communist parties of Poland and Hungary transformed themselves into credible democratic-left parties that became formidable opponents of the newly emerging political right. 
No strong social democratic party in Czechoslovakia could emerge from the rigid Czechoslovak Communist Party. 
In the absence of a credible democratic left party, Czech center-right politicians had the upper hand, and were relatively united, until 1997. 
However, lack of a strong opposition corrupted the political right, which splintered into various groupings that cannot find a common language. 
In Slovakia, where nationalist sentiments were an important political factor after 1989, the political spectrum has not yet coalesced along standard right-left political axis. 
The main political battles occur between nationalist/populist forces, whose outlook have in essence been undemocratic, and forces that struggle for standard democracy. 
The threat of return to power by Meciar forced all democrats, leftist or rightist, into one camp. 
Even in this situation the political right has been quarrelsome, creating space for Meciar's possible return to power. 
Hungary's political right has suffered mainly from differences between conservative and populist forces on the one hand, and traditional, mainly urban, liberals on the other. 
Various rightist parties failed to decide whether the modus operandi on the political right should be traditional Western ideologies or a Hungarian brand of nationalist conservatism and populism. 
Although the current governing coalition, consisting of conservatives and populists, has been successful, the real reckoning for Hungary's right may still be yet to come. 
Poland's right poses the most difficult case. 
Its problems originate in the communist era, when a trade union movement, which under normal circumstances should stand to the political left, became the main anti-communist opposition. 
As a result, various political groups associated with the Solidarity trade union movement have, since Communism's fall, aspired to represent the political right, confusing the terms of political discourse. 
Christian-democratic parties, associated with the Catholic Church, and the liberals have been to some extent marginalized. 
The confusion has been made complete by the existence of relatively strong nationalist and populist parties that use the numerous Polish farmers as their electoral base. 
As in other postcommunist countries, the main beneficiary of such a lack of unity has been the democratic left. 
Wall-to-Wall Wal-Mart? 
Do you want to know which video clip will soon be scaring the daylights out of policymakers throughout the world? 
In a scenario that looks uncannily like the spread of a global pandemic, the economist Thomas Holmes has prepared a dynamic map simulation showing the spread of Wal-Mart stores throughout the United States. 
Starting at the epicenter in Bentonville, Arkansas, where Sam Walton opened his first store in 1962, giant boxy Wal-Mart stores have now multiplied to the point where the average American lives less than seven kilometers from an outlet. 
Interestingly, the video shows how the stores spread out like petals of a flower, ever thickening and expanding. 
Rather than jumping out to the coasts -- 80% of all Americans live within 80 kilometers of the Pacific or Atlantic oceans -- Wal-Marts have spread organically through an ever-expanding supply chain. 
Even though each new store takes away business from Wal-Mart stores established nearby, ever-improving supply efficiencies help maintain the chain's overall growth. 
Love them or hate them, what is undeniable is that Wal-Mart is the quintessential example of the costs and benefits of modern globalization. 
Consumers pay significantly less than at traditional outlets. 
For example, economists estimate that the food section of Wal-Mart charges 25% less than a typical large supermarket chain. 
The differences in price for many other consumer goods is even larger. 
Consider the following stunning fact: together with a few sister "big box" stores (Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot), Wal-Mart accounts for roughly 50% of America's much vaunted productivity growth edge over Europe during the last decade. 
Fifty percent! 
Similar advances in wholesaling supply chains account for another 25%! 
The notion that Americans have gotten better at everything while other rich countries have stood still is thus wildly misleading. 
The US productivity miracle and the emergence of Wal-Mart-style retailing are virtually synonymous. 
I have nothing against big box stores. 
They are an enormous boon to low-income consumers, partly compensating for the tepid wage growth that many of them have suffered during the past two decades. 
And I don't agree with friends of mine who turn their noses down at Wal-Mart stores, and claim never to have visited one. 
As a consumer, I think big-box stores are great. 
They have certainly been great for America's trading partners; Wal-Mart alone accounts for over 10% of all US imports from China. 
But I do have some reservations about the Wal-Mart model as a blueprint for global growth. 
First, there is the matter of its effect on low-wage workers and smaller-scale retailers. 
While completely legal, studies suggest that Wal-Mart's labor policies exploit regulatory loopholes that, for example, allow it to sidestep the burden of healthcare costs for many workers (Wal-Mart provides healthcare coverage to less than half its workers). 
And the entry of big-box stores into a community crushes long-established retailers, often traumatically transforming their character. 
Yes, to some extent, such is the price of progress. 
But the loss of aesthetics and community is not easily captured in simple income and price statistics. 
Big-box stores are not exactly attractive -- hence their name. 
If they continue their explosive growth over the next 20 years, will Americans someday come to regard their proliferation as a spectacular example of the failure to adopt region-wide blueprints for balanced growth? 
Indeed, many Europeans, and others, will view Holmes's video simulation of Wal-Mart's spread as a horror film. 
The French may have invented the hyper mart -- the forerunner of the big-box store -- but they never intended to let their growth go unchecked. 
The big question for Europeans is whether they can find ways to exploit some of the efficiency gains embodied by the Wal-Mart model without being overrun by it. 
For Americans, there is the additional question of what to do when the big-box store phenomenon has run its course. 
If so much of the US productivity edge really amounts to letting Wal-Mart and its big-box cousins run amok, what will happen after this source of growth tapers off? 
The US economy has many other strengths, including its superior financial system and leading position in high-tech capital goods, but the fact remains that America's advantage in these areas has so far not been nearly as striking as the Wal-Mart phenomenon. 
It is curious how many people seem to think that the US will grow faster than Europe and Japan over the next ten years simply because it has done so for the past ten years. 
Wal-Mart and its ilk are a central feature of the modern era of globalization. 
They are not quite the pandemic that their explosive growth pattern resembles, but nor is their emergence completely benign. 
Those who would aim to emulate US productivity trends must come to grips with how they feel about big-box stores sprouting across their countryside's, driving down wages and plowing under smaller-scale retailers. 
Americans, in turn, must think about where the proper balance lies between aesthetics, community, and low prices. 
Embracing Science 
Long-term economic progress comes mainly from the invention and spread of improved technologies. 
The scientific revolution was made possible by the printing press, the industrial revolution by the steam engine, and India's escape from famine by increased farm yields -- the so-called "Green Revolution." 
Today's era of globalization emerged with the spread of computers and the Internet. 
Thus, when we seek solutions to some of the world's toughest problems, they, too, are likely to be found, at least in part, in new technologies that can resolve old and seemingly intractable problems. 
Consider poverty in Africa. 
Every conceivable explanation has been given, usually focusing on what Africans do wrong. 
But a visit to Africa's villages makes clear that the problems have more to do with the struggle for survival under difficult physical conditions than with any special problems that are unique to African societies. 
Africa's farmers produce roughly one-third or less food per hectare of farmland than their counterparts around the world, resulting in massive hunger, which is exacerbated by a heavy disease burden. 
Malaria poses a unique challenge, owing in large part to Africa's mosquito species, which are especially adept at transmitting the disease. 
Other tropical parasitic diseases imply similarly extraordinary burdens in Africa. 
Add the practical difficulties of broken-down roads and few cars and trucks, and economic isolation follows. 
So the challenges of survival are enormous. 
Yet practical solutions are at hand, because simple and low-cost technologies can address specific problems. 
Low farm yields can be addressed through improved seed varieties specially adapted for African conditions, combined with technologies for replenishing soil and managing water. 
Malaria can be controlled through newly designed long-lasting mosquito nets and a new generation of effective medicines. 
Other tropical diseases also can be controlled, and practical technologies for safe drinking water can dramatically reduce diarrheal diseases. 
Mobile phones, local wireless Internet, and more paved roads could do much to break the economic isolation of Africa's villages. 
Donor countries incessantly ask Africans to change their trade policies, government institutions, public administration, and more. 
Some of these changes are important, but the role of the rich countries has been lopsided, focusing on everything except how to finance and introduce practical technologies to solve practical problems. 
The rich countries' mistakes wouldn't matter if African countries had enough money to adopt the needed technologies on their own, but Africa is so poor that it must get financial help to escape poverty. 
The development challenges in Africa are just one example of how tough societal problems can be addressed by the design and spread of improved technologies. 
The same will be true of how the world best addresses manmade climate change -- another of those seemingly intractable global problems. 
Right now, rich countries are changing the world's climate by emitting billions of tons of carbon dioxide each year from the use of coal, oil, and natural gas. 
In future years, China and India also will make massive contributions to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 
Yet no country, rich or poor, is keen to cut its energy use, owing to concern that to do so would threaten jobs, incomes, and economic growth. 
New technologies will provide a key part of the solution. 
Already, "hybrid" automobiles, which combine gasoline and battery power, can roughly double fuel efficiency, cutting carbon dioxide emissions by half. 
Similarly, engineers have developed ways to capture the carbon dioxide that results from burning coal in power plants and store it safely underground. 
This new technology, called "carbon capture and sequestration," can cut by 80% the carbon dioxide emitted during the production of electricity. 
The costs appear relatively small. 
Consider also the depletion of ocean fisheries through over-fishing. 
Global demand for fish consumption is growing, and so, too, is the global capacity to catch fish, driving some species to the point of extinction. 
Improved aquaculture, in which fish are grown at manmade fishponds and reservoirs is still far from being a perfect technology, mainly for environmental reasons, yet it is enormously promising. 
On a recent visit to Africa, a senior agricultural scientist said that in today's world, the scientist is closer than ever before to the farmer, but farther away than ever from the policymakers. 
Politicians don't understand science, and rarely seek the advice of scientists and engineers in addressing major issues. 
Everything is viewed as politics and votes, not as technical problems requiring technological expertise, which is why Africa's poverty is so often attributed to corruption rather than to ecological challenges. 
It is easy to dismiss the suggestion that technology can save the day. 
After all, technological advance also requires good governance, market forces, effective universities, and more. 
Politics will still play its role. 
Nevertheless, it's time to recognize that governments are ill-equipped to understand the sophisticated technological challenges and opportunities facing the world, and that new ways are needed to ensure that science and technology are given the prominence needed to address a wide range of increasingly urgent global problems. 
Now is the time for every major international agency and national government to assume responsibility for gaining the scientific and technological expertise that they will need in the twenty-first century. 
Getting Latin America Unstuck 
One of the world economy's biggest puzzles is Latin America's poor performance. 
Since the early 1980's, Latin America has been stuck, with per capita incomes growing slowly (if at all) in most of the region, and with one big crisis following another. 
Many policies have been tried, especially trade liberalization, privatization of inefficient state enterprises, and budgetary reforms. 
Yet something is holding Latin America back. 
The lack of vigorous growth is all the more bewildering in view of Latin America's many advantages and social successes. 
Natural resources are plentiful, with vast amounts of fertile land. 
Health conditions are reasonably good, and all Latin American countries have made headway against illiteracy, with most reaching 90% adult literacy or higher. 
Moreover, fertility rates have fallen sharply, to a point where populations in many countries will probably level off in coming decades. 
Women's status has improved, and girls enjoy equal access to education, with even higher enrollment rates than boys in many countries. 
Latin America may be known for its "macho" culture, but women increasingly participate in the labor force and attain prominent political and social positions. 
Latin America boasts still other long-term advantages. 
Most people live near the coasts, with good access to international trade, and most live in cities - another advantage for growth. 
Indeed, the region is not poor by international standards, but rather stuck in the middle-income range between the world's poorest places and the high-income countries of North America, Europe, and East Asia. 
What, then, accounts for the puzzling lack of real growth over the past 25 years? 
I blame two unsolved, but solvable, problems. 
The first has been around for centuries: the social divisions that trace their origins back to the European conquest over Native Americans in the sixteenth century. 
More than most places, Latin America was born in violent conquest. 
Europeans subdued Amerindian populations and also brought in massive numbers of slaves from Africa, especially to the Caribbean basin and Brazil. 
Societies became racially and ethnically complex, as the European, Amerindian, and African populations intermarried, but the long-term trend of European dominance, indigenous and Afro-American subservience, and entrenched poverty became a scar on Latin American societies. 
Even today, income inequality in Latin America is among the highest in the world, reflecting the old patterns of ethnic and racial division. 
Income inequality casts a long shadow. 
The rich have long fought against taxation needed to increase investment in the education and health of the poor, perpetuating deep social divisions and leaving many people without the health and skills that global competitiveness requires. 
The situation today is improving in some places - such as Brazil - which augurs well for the future. 
In other places - for example, Guatemala and parts of the Andean region - social divisions remain fraught with violence and distrust. 
Beyond this, a basic failure of economic strategy has been largely overlooked, one that is reflected in a major difference between public policy discussions in Latin America and Asia. 
In Asia, public debate is about technology: how can Asia catch up? 
Asian governments relentlessly act to raise the scientific and technological capacities of their economies. 
In Latin America, the global technological revolution is much less discussed, and national policies to promote science and technology are rarely given prominence. 
The result is that Latin America has failed to benefit adequately from the global technological revolutions. 
Asian developing countries are now producers of computers, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and software. 
By contrast, even Latin America's star performer, Chile, remains largely a resource-based export economy, with a heavy concentration in copper and agricultural exports. 
These sectors are technologically sophisticated, but form a narrow base for long-term development. 
The situation is far from hopeless. 
Brazil has demonstrated the ability to be a technological export power. 
It has succeeded, notably, in exporting airplanes and many consumer durable goods. 
Mexico, too, has begun to mobilize significant technological prowess. 
Argentina, Chile, and other countries could become high-tech agricultural producers, in the forefront of agro-biotechnology for example, if they put their minds to it. 
Still, Latin American countries have not yet tried to foster a technological revolution, certainly not with the focus, skill, commitment, and financing that Asian countries have shown. 
Such a push could play a major role in jump-starting economic growth. 
Such a policy would entail committing to a major increase in spending on research and development, as Asian developing countries have done. 
Latin American countries should aim to increase spending to around 2% of GNP (from 0.5% currently), partly through public support for laboratories and universities and partly through incentives for private-sector R&D. They should roll out the red carpet for high-tech multinational firms, just as Asia has done. 
They should also increase their focus on scientific and technological training and encourage a higher proportion of students to go on to university education. 
Government stipends for tuition and for new and enlarged universities can play a big role, as can investment in computers and information technology in schools and communities. 
The social agenda and the technology agenda are not independent of each other. 
Both call upon Latin American societies to invest more in their people, so that Latin Americans can join the cutting edge of global productivity. 
If these investments reach all parts of Latin America, rich and poor, the region's prospects will brighten enormously. 
Are Housing Prices a House of Cards? 
The first big city to boom was London, starting around 1996. 
Boom mentality spread to Los Angeles, New York, and Sydney around 1997, to Paris in 1998, to Miami, Moscow, and Shanghai in 2001, and Vancouver around 2002. 
These and other cities have been booming pretty much ever since; prices in most are up at least 50% in real terms since 2000. 
This has been a big windfall to homeowners, but has hurt anyone planning to buy. 
Now growth in home prices is weakening in some of these cities. 
The rate of price growth in London and New York slowed sharply over the past year, to only about a 1% real increase in the second quarter of 2004. 
In Sydney, home prices actually fell in the second quarter. 
Has the boom ended? 
Will no other cities benefit? 
Worse still, could the mood in housing markets soon lead prices in downward? 
No one predicted this boom, so predicting its end is risky. 
Housing prices have shown tremendous upward momentum in the face of previous warnings that the party is over. 
Any prediction concerning the boom's end requires understanding why it occurred in so many places. 
Surprisingly, there is no well-received explanation, because this boom's ultimate causes are mostly psychological. 
Economists would rather talk about interest rates or unemployment statistics - factors that are concrete and knowable. 
Of course, these indicators do have a legitimate role to play in explaining housing markets, but they are simply not adequate to account for the recent booms. 
Three psychological causes stand out: first, a change in people's perceptions about the source of value in a changing world economy; second, increasing public faith in "glamour" cities with international name recognition; and third, the plain giddy dynamics of speculative bubbles. 
Each factor deserves greater attention if we are to understand current housing market conditions and discern future price trends. 
First, the world economy does look more chaotic than it did a decade ago. 
The crash in equity prices since 2000 in most countries has made financial assets look less secure, spurring a "flight to quality" - in this case, housing. 
Moreover, terrorism is now viewed as a problem for everyone, with major tragedies in Indonesia, Spain, and Russia. 
People feel safest investing in their homes, and there is little reason to expect imminent change. 
Fear and upward momentum in home prices go together. 
Second, the public's faith in glamorous international cities has increased with the explosive growth in global communications due to the Internet and the cell phone. 
Just as people increasingly admire international celebrities, so they believe that world famous centers of business, technology, and culture - whose names are household words to people everywhere - are uniquely valuable. 
As with fear of terrorism and suspicion of equities, geographical celebrity appears resilient, if not self-reinforcing: the more famous New York, Paris, and London get, the more glamorous they become. 
Third, and no less important, is the speculative contagion that underlies any bubble. 
The current boom has seen contagion within markets and across markets, as rising prices fuel popular excitement - and hence further price increases - in the same city, and then in other cities, even on the other side of the globe. 
People in Shanghai may not talk about London home prices, but Shanghai's opinion leaders know what is happening in London, and the boom there makes it seem plausible that there should be a boom in Shanghai, too. 
In contrast to the other two psychological causes, speculative contagion has a natural end. 
A speculative bubble, sustaining itself solely by reaction to price increases, cannot go on forever. 
So, where does this leave us? 
Two of the three psychological causes suggest continued upward momentum in housing prices, while the third suggests that the momentum will come to an end some day, but does not pinpoint when. 
I am betting that some high-flying glamour cities will continue to see decelerating growth in home prices - and eventually decreases. 
Historically, housing prices have shown a lot of momentum, and prices in all these cities are still going up at a brisk rate, though usually somewhat slower than a year or more ago. 
Based on extrapolation of growth trends, it looks safe to predict that prices will go up substantially in most of these places for another year or more, even as the rate of increase continues to decline. 
The psychological factors are more important for longer-term forecasts, beyond a year, where momentum no longer plays an important role. 
At this point, there is likely to be some downward instability in prices, because enthusiasm for investing in houses is likely to wane in line with declining price growth. 
Prices in glamour cities are likely to drop sharply the next time there is a serious recession, or if the local economy suffers a severe shock, or if interest rates rise too fast. 
Then, contagion within and across markets can work in a downward direction, propelling prices lower for years. 
Water for All 
This month, water once again takes center stage at the Fourth World Water Forum in Mexico City. 
It is an opportune moment: while much of the world's attention has been fixed on issues of energy supply and security, hundreds of millions of people in the developing world continue to see the supply and security of fresh water as equally, if not more, important. 
Surveys undertaken by the World Bank in developing countries show that, when poor people are asked to name the three most important concerns they face, "good health" is always mentioned. 
And a key determinant of whether they will have good health or not is access to clean water. 
More than a billion people around the world today do not. 
As a result, they are increasingly vulnerable to poor health. 
The World Bank estimates that by 2035, as many as three billion people, almost all of them in developing countries, could live under conditions of severe water stress, especially if they happen to live in Africa, the Middle East, or South Asia. 
This will cause obvious hardship, but it will also hold back the economic growth needed for millions of people to escape poverty. 
In Latin America, about 15% of the population -- roughly 76 million people -- do not have access to safe water, and 116 million people do not have access to sanitation services. 
The figures are worse in Africa and parts of Asia. 
This is a situation that few people in rich countries face. 
Generally, these countries' citizens enjoy services that provide for all water needs, from drinking to irrigation to sanitation. 
In addition, other water-related issues, such as the risks posed by flooding, have been reduced to manageable levels. 
Rich industrial countries have invested early and heavily in water infrastructure, institutions, and management capacities. 
The result, beyond the health benefits for all, has been a proven record of economic growth; one only has to look at investment in hydropower to see the positive impact of water management projects on many economies. 
Granted, rich countries have a certain advantage: they benefit from generally moderate climates, with regular rainfall and relatively low risks of drought and flooding. 
Even so, they are not immune to water-related disasters, as Hurricane Katrina's destruction of New Orleans taught us. 
But the impact of such events on poor countries is much greater. 
Extreme rainfall variations, floods, and droughts can have huge social and economic effects and result in the large-scale loss of life. 
The Gulf coast of Mexico and Central American countries has repeatedly experienced such tragedies, with poor communities the most vulnerable and the least able to cope. 
Ethiopia and Yemen are equally stark examples. 
Ethiopia's development potential is closely tied to seasonal rains, so high rainfall variation, together with lack of infrastructure, has undermined growth and perpetuated poverty. 
A single drought can cut growth potential by 10% over an extended period. 
Yemen, for its part, has no perennial surface water; its citizens depend entirely on rainfall, groundwater, and flash flooding. 
To move forward, developing countries need new water infrastructure and better management. 
Any approach must be tailored to the circumstances of each country and the needs of its people, but there is no fundamental constraint to designing water development investments that ensure that local communities and the environment gain tangible and early benefits. 
In some countries, new water infrastructure may mean canals, pumping stations, and levees. 
Still others might need deeper reservoirs, more modern filtration plants, or improved water transport schemes. 
These can all potentially be designed to improve and expand water supplies for power generation, irrigation, and household and industrial use, while providing security against droughts and protection from floods. 
The key to successful increased investment in water infrastructure is an equally increased investment in water institutions. 
Badly managed infrastructure will do little to improve peoples' health or support economic growth, so water development and water management must go hand in hand. 
Water infrastructure can and must be developed in parallel with sound institutions, good governance, great attention to the environment, and an equitable sharing of costs and benefits. 
A water investment policy that reduces the vulnerability of the poor and offers basic water security for all will require customized planning and an effective partnership of donor countries, developing country governments, the private sector, and local communities. 
Delegates to the World Water Forum will have ample opportunity to forge and/or strengthen these partnerships. 
If they succeed, the rewards for the world's poor will be immense. 
Germany's Five Shocks 
Over the last decade, Germany has been the slowest growing economy in the European Union, and Europe has been the slowest growing continent in the world. 
From 1995 to 2005, Germany will have grown by only 14.6%, while the old EU on average will have grown by 24%, the US by 39.9%, and the world economy by 45.6%. 
Why has Germany performed so badly? 
One theory, endorsed by the head of Germany's ruling Social Democratic Party, Franz Müntefering, is that Germany is already where the others still want to be. 
Slow German growth, he maintains, is a sign of natural convergence. 
But this theory is not convincing. 
Germany has recently been overtaken in terms of per capita income by several EU countries, including Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands, and France, and is still growing more slowly than all of them. 
Another, more plausible theory is that over the past fifteen years there have been various external challenges or shocks that have hit the country simultaneously. 
Rigid as it was, with an extensive welfare system and an over-regulated labor market, Germany was unable to react to these shocks and ran into trouble. 
This theory recalls that of the British historian Arnold Toynbee, according to which empires collapse because they are unable to react to external challenges. 
The first shock was intensified globalization, which brought a lot of new low-wage competition. 
Although globalization is a gradual process, it gained momentum when China decided to play the game. 
China is ten times the size of Japan, and Japan was not easy to deal with, either. 
German precision instruments and optical equipment, for example, lost their competitive edge when Japan entered the game. 
The second shock was EU integration, including the northern and southern enlargements. 
The dismantling of the EU's internal borders boosted each country's market size and brought about the predicted economies of scale. 
But this helped Europe's small countries more than the big ones, and it implied more competition for Germany, Europe's biggest economy. 
Think of Nokia, the mobile phone maker. 
Due to the economies of scale that the common market made possible, Nokia was able to exploit its inventions fully, while Germany's Siemens recently decided to give up on the mobile phone market. 
The third shock was the euro, which has induced a rapid convergence of long-term interest rates, which in some countries had been five to seven percentage points above the German level. 
Freed from exchange-rate risk, international investors no longer demanded a risk premium from these countries and were willing to provide funds to all of them under the same favorable conditions that previously had been reserved for Germany. 
This is good for Europe, because it helps improve the allocation of capital and stimulates growth by transporting German savings to the remote and previously disadvantaged regions of the euro zone. 
But it is of doubtful benefit to German workers who also would have liked to cooperate with that capital. 
The fourth shock was eastern EU enlargement, which has brought extraordinary chances for trade and investment in the east, but has also brought massive low-wage competition. 
On average, wage costs in the ten countries that joined the EU in 2004 are only 14% of the West German level. 
Low-wage competition has led to substantial outsourcing and off-shoring activities that have kept German firms competitive by reducing their demand for domestic labor. 
As neither Germany's unions nor its welfare state would accept falling wages, the result was higher unemployment and slower growth. 
The fifth shock was German unification, which is a failure in economic terms. 
GDP per working-age person in East Germany had been 61% of the West German level in 1996, but it is now only 59%. 
The slow growth of the eastern part of the country has pulled down the Germany-wide average, while the enormous demand for public funds in the east has increased public debt. 
The weak fiscal position has in turn undermined investors' confidence, with obvious implications for economic growth. 
All five shocks constitute historical developments that are good for the world as a whole, but problematic for Germany. 
In order for the country to meet the challenges and to continue to grow, it would have to make its labor markets flexible. 
Only if wages adjust downward to accommodate the new international environment can German workers become competitive again, so that the country returns to a higher employment level, exploiting its human capital up to the capacity constraint. 
The new government that voters will most likely elect in September will be confronted with the difficult task of confronting Germans with reality and pushing through the necessary reforms. 
Only then will we know whether Germany can meet the Toynbeean challenge it is facing. 
Lessons from the Tsunami 
There are many lessons that emerge from the tsunami that brought such devastation and loss of life to Asia. 
It demonstrated the power of globalization, as television brought vivid pictures of the destruction to homes around the world. 
Indeed, it is at times like this that the world truly does seem like a global village. 
Of course, it seemed to take somewhat longer for news of the extent of the disaster to reach the Crawford, Texas, ranch of President Bush. 
But, in the end, he decided to interrupt his vacation and offer amounts of aid that were successively revised upwards, in a global competition which promised to benefit those who were desperate for help. 
America's aid still appeared niggardly when compared with the amounts offered by countries with a fraction of America's economic wealth. 
Lightly populated Australia offered more than twice America's assistance, Japan promised almost 50% more, and Europe pledged more than five times as much. 
This led many observers to reflect on the fact that the world's richest country was in general the most miserly in foreign assistance -- all the more so in comparison to the amount it spends on war and defense. 
The disaster was international, so it was appropriate that the United Nations take the lead in coordinating the relief effort. 
Unfortunately, in an effort that was widely seen as another attempt to undermine multilateralism, the US tried to lead a "core group" driving the assistance program, ignoring ongoing efforts within the region and at the UN. 
Whatever America's motive, it later wisely decided to join the UN effort. 
The Bush administration's face-saving rhetoric that it had rushed to push together the core group in the absence of other efforts was quietly let to pass. 
The response of some countries within the region was truly impressive, showing how far they had come in establishing efficient and effective governments. 
Myriad details were addressed: Thailand flew ambassadors to the affected part of the country to help attend to the needs of their citizens, helped those who lost their money and passports return home, provided health care for the injured, set up systems to identify bodies, and dealt with the difficulties posed by shortages of body bags and the lack of cold storage facilities. 
Countries, like Thailand, that felt that they could handle the finances on their own asked that assistance be directed to others. 
They did ask one thing: a reduction of tariff barriers and greater access to markets abroad. 
They didn't want a handout, only a chance to earn income. 
The response, at least at the time of this column's writing, has mostly been deafening silence. 
On the other hand, the G-7 made a truly important contribution in offering debt relief. 
This is especially important for Indonesia, which must service a debt of $132 billion (of which $70 billion is owed to public creditors or guaranteed by government agencies). 
Even without the tsunami, this debt burden would have been an enormous hindrance to the country's development as it finally recovers from the aftermath of the 1997 financial crisis. 
Indeed, there is a compelling case to be made for Indonesian debt relief in any case, given that much of the debt was incurred in loans to the corrupt Suharto government. 
Lenders knew, or should have known, that not all of the money was going to help Indonesian development. 
Moreover, some of the debt was incurred as part of the 1997-1998 crisis, which was aggravated and deepened by IMF-imposed policies. 
No one pretends that we can prevent or alter the forces of nature. 
Rather, we have to learn to cope with them. 
There are now calls for improved tsunami early warning systems. 
But in one area, global warming, we have already received an early warning. 
Most countries have recognized this, coming together in Rio and Kyoto to do something about it—not enough, but the Kyoto protocol was intended only as a start. 
Sadly, global warming will likely destroy some of the same countries ravaged by the tsunami. 
Low lying islands like the Maldives will become submerged. 
We are, however, still not a global village. 
After first disputing that there was scientific evidence of the problem, the largest polluter in the world, the US, is now simply refusing to do anything about it (other than preaching voluntary restraint—of which there is little evidence, at least in America). 
The international community has yet to figure out what to do with an aberrant member who fails to live up to its responsibilities as a global citizen. 
Optimists say that technology will solve the problem. 
Realists observe that in the long race between the environment and technology, it appears that technology has so far been losing. 
Nature, as we have learned from the tsunami, has its own timetable. 
Unless we learn how to respect it, we will all miss the boat. 
How Accurate Are Your Pet Pundits? 
Every day, experts bombard us with their views on topics as varied as Iraqi insurgents, Bolivian coca growers, European central bankers, and North Korea's Politburo. 
But how much credibility should we attach to the opinions of experts? 
The sanguine view is that as long as those selling expertise compete vigorously for the attention of discriminating buyers (the mass media), market mechanisms will assure quality control. 
Pundits who make it into newspaper opinion pages or onto television and radio must have good track records; otherwise, they would have been weeded out. 
Skeptics, however, warn that the mass media dictate the voices we hear and are less interested in reasoned debate than in catering to popular prejudices. 
As a result, fame could be negatively, not positively, correlated with long-run accuracy. 
Until recently, no one knew who is right, because no one was keeping score. 
But the results of a 20-year research project now suggest that the skeptics are closer to the truth. 
I describe the project in detail in my book Expert Political Judgment: How good is it? 
How can we know? 
The basic idea was to solicit thousands of predictions from hundreds of experts about the fates of dozens of countries, and then score the predictions for accuracy. 
We find that the media not only fail to weed out bad ideas, but that they often favor bad ideas, especially when the truth is too messy to be packaged neatly. 
The evidence falls into two categories. 
First, as the skeptics warned, when hordes of pundits are jostling for the limelight, many are tempted to claim that they know more than they do. 
Boom and doom pundits are the most reliable over-claimers. 
Between 1985 and 2005, boomsters made 10-year forecasts that exaggerated the chances of big positive changes in both financial markets (e.g., a Dow Jones Industrial Average of 36,000) and world politics (e.g., tranquility in the Middle East and dynamic growth in sub-Saharan Africa). 
They assigned probabilities of 65% to rosy scenarios that materialized only 15% of the time. 
In the same period, doomsters performed even more poorly, exaggerating the chances of negative changes in all the same places where boomsters accentuated the positive, plus several more (I still await the impending disintegration of Canada, Nigeria, India, Indonesia, South Africa, Belgium, and Sudan). 
They assigned probabilities of 70% to bleak scenarios that materialized only 12% of the time. 
Second, again as the skeptics warned, over-claimers rarely pay penalties for being wrong. 
Indeed, the media shower lavish attention on over-claimers while neglecting their humbler colleagues. 
We can see this process in sharp relief when, following the philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin, we classify experts as "hedgehogs" or "foxes." 
Hedgehogs are big-idea thinkers in love with grand theories: libertarianism, Marxism, environmentalism, etc. 
Their self-confidence can be infectious. 
They know how to stoke momentum in an argument by multiplying reasons why they are right and others are wrong. 
That wins them media acclaim. 
But they don't know when to slam the mental brakes by making concessions to other points of view. 
They take their theories too seriously. 
The result: hedgehogs make more mistakes, but they pile up more hits on Google. 
Eclectic foxes are better at curbing their ideological enthusiasms. 
They are comfortable with protracted uncertainty about who is right even in bitter debates, conceding gaps in their knowledge and granting legitimacy to opposing views. 
They sprinkle their conversations with linguistic qualifiers that limit the reach of their arguments: ‘but,' ‘however,' ‘although.' 
Because they avoid over-simplification, foxes make fewer mistakes. 
Foxes will often agree with hedgehogs up to a point, before complicating things: "Yes, my colleague is right that the Saudi monarchy is vulnerable, but remember that coups are rare and that the government commands many means of squelching opposition." 
Imagine your job as a media executive depends on expanding your viewing audience. 
Whom would you pick: an expert who balances conflicting arguments and concludes that the likeliest outcome is more of the same, or an expert who gets viewers on the edge of their seats over radical Islamists seizing control and causing oil prices to soar? 
In short, the qualities that make foxes more accurate also make them less popular. 
At this point, uncharitable skeptics chortle that we get the media we deserve. 
But that is unfair. 
No society has yet created a widely trusted method for keeping score on the punditocracy. 
Even citizens who prize accuracy have little way of knowing that they are sacrificing it when they switch channels from boring foxes to charismatic hedgehogs. 
Here, then, is a modest proposal that applies to all democracies: the marketplace of ideas works better if it is easier for citizens to see the trade-offs between accuracy and entertainment, or between accuracy and party loyalty. 
Wouldn't they be more likely to read pundits with better track records? 
If so, pundits might adapt to accountability by showing more humility, and political debate might begin to sound less shrill. 
Granted, it is not easy to create methods of keeping score that are credible across the spectrum of reasonable opinion. 
But in a world where, as Yeats said, "and the best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity," it is worth trying. 
What Next for Europe? 
In many ways, 2005 has been Europe's annus horibilis. 
It began well, when Spanish voters approved the draft European Union constitution, but it turned sour when French and Dutch voters spurned it soon after. 
Those votes partly reflected displeasure with domestic policies, and partly disappointment with the way governments conduct European affairs. 
Governments promptly obliged with more of the same. 
Within days of the votes, they failed to agree on the EU budget for 2007-13. 
French and British leaders engaged in a heated quarrel that derailed the subsequent summit, before Britain assumed the rotating six-month EU presidency in July. 
Normally, countries use their EU presidencies to display their ability to solve problems and move the Union forward. 
But, as of early December, Britain has remained dormant. 
Besides burying the draft constitution, it has largely sidestepped the budget issue. 
Chances that it gets the budget approved this year are slim, and, unless the dispute is resolved soon, the Union will not have an operational budget by 2007. 
Even if a budget is adopted, there is no lack of depressing business for the Austrian presidency, which starts on January 1. 
The deepest problem is Europe's inability to grow at more than a snail's pace and to provide jobs to its citizens. 
This is mostly due to the Big Three -- France, Germany, and Italy -- which produce 70% of Europe's GDP. 
The collective response, adopted in 2000, has been the "Lisbon Strategy," which aims at making the EU "the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world" by 2010. 
More realistically, it is designed to provide governments with the incentive to undertake the reforms that stimulate economic growth and productivity. 
That means facing down the myriad interest groups -- from industry lobbies to trade unions and entrenched bureaucracies -- that have (so far) successfully protected their turfs. 
The strategy rests on peer pressure, naming and shaming governments that fail to make progress. 
In practice, however, peer pressure has become peer collusion. 
When EU leaders met last spring to assess progress, they pitifully recognized that the Lisbon Strategy's goal was unlikely to be met. 
The best that they could do now would be to dump the pretense of a strategy and carry on with the other business. 
Unfortunately, the host of the 2000 summit was José Manuel Barroso, then Prime Minister of Portugal and current President of the European Commission, who has staked his presidency on the Lisbon Strategy. 
Expect him to push on hopelessly. 
One of the few good ideas contained in the Lisbon Strategy was to remove barriers to trade in services. 
Intra-European competition in services is restricted by innumerable national regulations that, for instance, strictly determine the requirements for becoming a hairdresser or a plumber. 
One of the defining features of the past decades is the sharp increase in services productivity in the US; none of that happened in Europe. 
Guess why. 
Because services account for 70% of European GDP, the potential impact from enhanced competition is substantial. 
But removing protection is always politically difficult. 
The European Commission submitted a proposal in 2005 -- just as the constitution was being put up for a vote. 
Not surprisingly, the proposal was quickly shelved. 
Now, with countless private interest groups trying to water it down into irrelevance, the battle will be firmly on the EU's agenda in 2006. 
At the same time, Europe is again blocking progress in the Doha round of world trade talks, with the farmers' lobby fighting to preserve its subsidies. 
Many governments are so fearful of their farmers that they see no other option than to hold their ground, no matter what. 
Europe has agreed to a single trade policy. 
When disagreements run as deep as they do on agriculture, there can be no give-and-take of the kind that allows for successful negotiations. 
There is little reason for optimism. 
And what next for the ECB, which has just nudged up interest rates by 0.25%, after 30 months on hold. 
Experts can disagree about whether the move was premature, but no one agrees with the many political leaders who have argued that the tiny hike will derail the timid resumption of economic growth. 
The sharpness of political attacks on the ECB might trigger dangerous talk about restricting its independence. 
While such a move is out of the question -- it would require a change in the European Treaty -- the noise is unhealthy. 
It distracts the ECB, adds to the impression that Europe is bad, and, more importantly, will be used by ineffective governments as a scapegoat for their failings. 
Expect more ECB-bashing. 
Is Europe stuck? 
The current team of leaders has been an enormous disappointment. 
But as they fade away, there could be some light at the end of the tunnel. 
In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel is obviously more positive on Europe and more pro-reform than her predecessor, but she is tied up in a grand coalition. 
In France, President Jacques Chirac, the epitome of a leader captured by his lobbies, is staggering impotently toward the end of his term in 2007. 
The two frontrunners to succeed him, Dominique de Villepin and Nicolas Sarkozy, both in government, compete on a reformist agenda, but pre-election years do not encourage bold moves. 
Meanwhile, Italy must decide whether it replaces Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who displayed no interest in reform and European affairs, with the cautious Romano Prodi, the former European Commission President. 
Tony Blair, once an ardent pro-European (at least by Britain's undemanding standards), might finally have to cede power to Gordon Brown, who is famously cold to European integration. 
Fortunately, Britain has always been an outsider. 
In the end, whatever light there is, it may not shine until 2007, after the French elections. 
Taming Politicians on Both Sides of the Atlantic
Despite occasional grumbles from politicians, no one seriously doubts the European Central Bank's independence, or that monetary policy within the euro zone is therefore well insulated from political pressures.
But the recent death of the Stability and Growth Pact-killed off by Germany, its father, with France acting as co-conspirator and willing accomplice-reminds us of a key lesson: elected politicians find it hard, if not impossible, to relinquish substantial power in the area of fiscal policy.
The same is true across the Atlantic.
The US Federal Reserve Board is, of course, very independent.
But any attempt to limit the fiscal discretion of America's Federal government in the manner of the Stability Pact-for example, the infamous Gramm/Rudman rules of the Clinton era-always collapse in the end in the face of presidential and congressional pressure.
Monetary policy can be used to stimulate an economy just as much as fiscal policy, if not more, in election years, which politicians will always want to do.
But reckless use of either mechanism for short-term goals may create long-term costs, justifying some restrictions on politicians' latitude in influencing macroeconomic policies.
When politicians can control inflation by exercising decisive sway over central banks, they can use their power to devalue the burden of public debt, avoiding the need for more taxation to pay it off.
This was the great lesson of the 1970's and early 1980's, when rampant inflation forced politicians to surrender this power to independent central banks, which alone could convince markets that price stability would be restored.
Yet monetary policy is not a unique species of economic policymaking.
Aspects of fiscal policy could also be delegated to independent bureaucrats in order to keep politicians in line.
Why not, for example, entrust an independent bureaucracy with some redistributive goals or control over the level of public investment or deficit management?
An independent fiscal authority could arguably implement a society's long-term goals in these areas better than politicians, who have their eyes on the next election.
Indeed, as a matter of principle, it is not clear why monetary policy and fiscal policy should be treated so differently, with one completely delegated to a bureaucratic agency and the other completely discretionary and in the hand of politicians.
So why do we see this large difference in reality in both America and Europe?
The answer is that fiscal policy is the key tool politicians use to attract and maintain the support of a winning coalition of voters, say retirees, public employees, and middle-class homeowners, while imposing the costs on the losers.
It is not necessary to please 100% of the voters, only enough to win.
The fiscal card is critical in choosing which groups of voters to buy.
Independent fiscal authorities-or fiscal rules such as the Stability Pact-stand in the way of this political use of fiscal policy, which is costly.
After all, if politicians could not win elections by taking money from some-including future generations, which will have to foot a portion of the bill-and giving it to others, they would have to work much harder to display some ability in producing public benefits for all.
This is far more difficult!
Of course, monetary policy also has redistributive effects.
Think about the different effects of interest rates on debtors versus creditors.
However, monetary policy is a much more awkward, indirect and imprecise way of choosing winners and losers than fiscal policy.
Independent central banks can occasionally be a pain for politicians, but at least they can be used as scapegoats when necessary-a role whose political benefits outweigh the costs of losing control over a useful tool.
These considerations should guide the choice of what will follow the Stability Pact in Europe.
It is now abundantly clear that national governments (especially those of large countries) will never accept substantial limitations on their fiscal discretion.
They may have suspended their freedom of fiscal maneuver long enough to launch the euro, but in normal times, national governments will reclaim their fiscal turf.
So the European Commission should stop fighting a rearguard battle that merely weakens its credibility, especially in the eyes of small countries, which are the only ones that can be bullied into accepting unwanted fiscal rules.
Realistically, all that the Commission can ask of European national governments is for transparency and clarity in their fiscal accounts.
Preventing the political use of fiscal policy is an impossible task.
But at least a country's fiscal actions should not be hidden in its budgets' obscure methodological footnotes.
Even this limited goal may not be easy to achieve.
A strategic lack of transparency is the bread and butter of shrewd politicians who want to please a lobby by hiding the costs of the public's largesse from the majority of citizens.
The rules that govern politicians' behavior must not be written as if disinterested, well-intentioned public servants will apply them.
Politicians are willing to go to great lengths to please their supporters and win elections.
The best that we can plausibly hope for is to ensure that the worst of what they do is done out in the open.
Will the EU Keep Faith with Turkey?
More than forty years ago, Turkey applied for associate membership of the European Economic Community.
With the Association agreement of 1963, a special relationship was established, culminating in the customs union of 1996.
During all these years, European governments consistently confirmed Turkey's eligibility for full membership, making accession dependent on compliance with membership criteria.
Turkey's formal recognition as a candidate state in 1999 led Turkey to undertake unprecedented reform efforts in the area of human and minority rights, including abolition of the death penalty, safeguards against torture, promotion of religious freedoms, gender equality, and restriction of the military's role in political life.
Should the EU consider the accession criteria as having been fulfilled, it must decide to open negotiations in early 2005.
Not to do so would mean to renege on political commitments and to severely damage the EU's credibility in the world.
In many parts of Europe, however, Turkey's admission to the EU is viewed with skepticism owing to its size, relatively poor economy, fears of massive immigration, and, above all, cultural and societal differences - a euphemism for Islam.
It would be foolish to deny that some of these factors represent serious challenges.
However, they are often exaggerated and certainly not insurmountable.
Negotiations with Turkey would be lengthy and accession may not occur before 2015.
This period of time would offer both Turkey and the Union an opportunity to come to terms.
With 80 million people, Turkey would be one of the largest EU states.
But the size of a country plays only a limited role in the EU's decision-making process, because political influence within the Union depends more on economic power.
Moreover, for decades Turkey has been a responsible member of many European institutions, and there is no reason to believe that it would act differently in the EU.
Because of its weak economy, Turkey would be eligible for substantial EU assistance.
The size of these transfers, however, would depend on the EU's financial policies at the time of admission, the outcome of accession negotiations, and economic developments in Turkey.
In any case, the EU's practice of "capping" its budget would prevent an explosion in the financial costs entailed by Turkey's accession.
Immigration should not be a cause for undue concern, either.
Human mobility is limited, and Turkey workers' would probably be allowed to move freely within the EU only after a long transition period, possibly not before 2025.
Given the expected upswing of Turkey's economy and its declining birthrate, experts predict a figure of around 2.7 million immigrants by that point.
Meanwhile, diminishing and aging populations in most of Europe will have made immigration a necessity.
Among the countries from where immigration to the EU is probable, Turkey has the best prospects for successful adaptation.
It is Turkey's Muslim population that creates the strongest emotions.
Many feel that Turkey simply does not fit into a European society based on Christian traditions and culture.
It is also feared that Islamists may one day turn Turkey into a fundamentalist state.
Unlikely as it may be in view of Turkey's deeply rooted secularism, such a risk cannot be totally excluded.
But the same is true for any other democracy, where radical groups could well misuse the democratic process for their purposes.
Surely, the best protection against such a calamity is to strengthen Turkey's democratic system, which can best be achieved by anchoring it firmly in a bloc of similarly democratic countries.
As for the EU, it must decide whether it wants to be a closed "Christian club" or an open and inclusive society, drawing strength from cultural and religious diversity.
Turkey's accession to the Union would give a powerful answer, one that would be heard with particular clarity in the Islamic world.
The need to refute arguments against Turkey's admission to the EU leaves the advantages rarely mentioned: its unique geopolitical position at the crossroads of the Balkans, Southern Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East - vitally important regions for Europe's security; its role as mayor transit country for energy supplies; its military capabilities at a time when the EU is developing its new European Defense Policy; and the great potential of the Turkish economy, with its young and dynamic labor force.
At the same time, the risks of rejecting Turkey must also be taken into account: the likelihood that the reform process would collapse, bringing radical currents to the fore and leading to instability and political unrest at the EU's doorsteps.
Turkish EU membership presents both opportunities and challenges.
On balance, however, the advantages far outweigh the risks.
Playing at Democracy
In Calcutta, when some younger kid came along and insisted on joining the game my friends were playing, we would let the new kid in, but only after whispering into each other's ears the words,
As a child, mastering the cruel art of
The technique of
What's true of children and adults is also true of international institutions.
Indeed, organizations that are officially committed to involving all nations in their decision making are often controlled by small groups of powerful nations, while others merely go through the motions of participation.
The World Trade Organization (WTO), supposedly run on the principle of one country one vote, actually has its agenda selected behind the stage by a small group of nations.
It is now standard practice for international organizations publishing a report to involve all the "stakeholders" and to reflect their opinions.
So the evolving report is usually put up on a Web site and suggestions are invited from one and all--NGOs, trade unions, and other organizations of civil society.
This promotes a sense of participation, but as a friend, seasoned in such matters, informed me, the key in the end is to ignore all the comments received and to write up the report as if there were no Web site and no participation.
Increasingly, free expression of opinion does not influence or restrain how government behaves.
Consider the United States.
People expressed their opinion freely--in newspapers, on television, in Internet chat rooms--concerning George Bush's planned war on Iraq.
Never before was there so much opposition to a war
Part of what happened--or, rather what didn't happen--is admirable: almost no effort was made to muzzle criticism of the government, as happens in China and scores of dictatorial countries.
But the world's great democracies--the US, India, the UK, and others--are increasingly adept at not allowing freely expressed opinions to constrain what the government does.
The current war in Iraq is perhaps the strongest proof of this.
Leaving aside the immorality of this war--and immoral it is--I wish to draw attention to this increasing ability and inclination of democracies to "deal" with (meaning neutralize) public opinion.
They have embraced the
As democracies mature they become ever more practiced at managing opinion, and in many cases, at shaping opinion.
Every time Hans Blix commented on the UN inspections of Iraq that he was conducting, members of the Bush administration would paraphrase what Blix said.
The paraphrasing would subtly change Blix's comments to suit America's case for war.
By repeating the altered comments, it was hoped, mass opinion would shift in favor of the war.
Overthrowing a totalitarian regime and organizing elections may be hard, but the harder task is to go from voting to establishing a true democracy.
For people accustomed to living in a totalitarian state, learn what participation means is not easy.
Hence the popular belief that democracies, like wine, improve with age.
While this may be true, there is a downside to maturity.
Just as citizens in a democracy continuously learn to participate, democratic governments continuously learn how to get their way despite the participation.
It is no use denying that civic participation too often serves only to legitimize a sham.
We must recognize and confront this problem to prevent established democracies from atrophying and to help new democracies become more effective.
For it is not only morally wrong to leave nations and communities feeling marginalized and without voice; it is a recipe for frustration, rage, and terrorism.
Recasting Governance in Asia
Governance--the way in which decisions that affect the public interest are made--has emerged as a key factor in determining a country's pace of development.
Successful governance brings purposeful change.
Failure is punished by unrest, disaffection, and stagnation. On April 18
Today's Asian policymakers confront a very different environment from that faced by their predecessors fifty years ago.
Asia's population has more than doubled since 1950, with most of that growth coming in its poorest countries.
The political systems of these countries were tailored to small, static, rural populations.
Now these societies must cope not only with vast urban centers, but also with the very different talents and demands of urbanized people.
The global economy has changed dramatically, too.
Increased flows of goods, money, and knowledge around the world mean that foreign organizations and individuals become more influential, making it increasingly difficult for national governments manage their countries by themselves.
For example, international bodies such as the WTO have changed the framework within which economic decisions are taken.
Local economic change has been equally dramatic.
In parts of Asia, living standards have skyrocketed.
Foreign investment from within and outside the region has altered the structure of domestic economies.
Old models of economic growth, however, such as export orientation and selective use of import restrictions that worked well for East Asia in the last century, are less feasible under today's global trade rules.
So new rules of the game are needed.
In most Asian countries, formal rules need to be simplified and applied more fairly.
A "back to basics" approach is vital in three inter-linked areas, in which national governments must take the lead: minimizing corruption, enforcing property rights, and consistent application of the rule of law.
Few countries score strongly here.
Close links between business and governments were blamed by many for the financial crisis that struck Southeast Asia in 1997.
In parts of South Asia, violent conflict and the power of vested interests threaten the rule of law.
The result of such failures is that small elites benefit while the majority suffers.
A clear structure of formal rules is the best antidote to these flaws, for they bolster the informal customs on which so much in society depends.
Most business is not conducted in courts but in meetings where trust and reputation are essential.
As the social theorist Robert Putnam has explained, "social capital"--the networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate cooperation and coordination for mutual benefit--is as much a determinant as it is a result of economic growth.
Empowering as many members citizens as possible is likely to instill a widespread sense of purpose into efforts to move countries forward.
Government, the private sector, and civil society all have a role to play in strengthening social capital.
But successful interactions between these sectors cannot be wished into existence, and it is essential that the role of each is clearly defined.
Many Asian governments recognize the need to define their roles more clearly.
Following the 1997 crisis, the state withdrew further from markets, acknowledging the limits to what it can achieve and the importance of allowing private enterprise to flourish.
But governments retain a role in fostering an enabling environment within which markets operate.
Monitoring rules and enforcement are important, but different ways of working--say, through public-private partnerships--are also increasingly being considered in many innovative Asian economies.
The valuable role of civil society in giving voice to communities that governments cannot reach is also recognized, but its relationship with government and business is often characterized more by conflict than cooperation.
The private sector's role in decision-making, too, often needs to be clarified--where businesses have too much influence over government, their need to operate profitable may lead to policies that favor the few over the many.
The metaphor of a game--with rules and participants--leads many to think in terms of a competition between nations.
This is not entirely healthy, as our interdependent world is not a zero-sum game, where one country's gain is another's loss.
Indeed, countries do not compete against each other in the way that firms do.
Trade is potentially a positive-sum game, with all countries benefiting by exploiting their areas of comparative advantage.
Good governance can enhance this positive-sum game, and ensure that companies and individuals within countries partake of the benefits.
In another sense, however, it is valuable to think of governments as being in competition--providing a more effective service to their people than other governments.
International comparison of systems therefore plays an important role.
In this spirit, this month's UNCTAD-UNDP conference--"Governance in Asia: Underpinning Competitiveness in a Global Economy"--will bring together policy-makers from across Asia to discuss the governance challenges that Asia faces.
The role of government--the only actor possessing the legitimacy of a popular mandate--is fundamentally important in steering a society forward.
The private sector and civil society are, of course, increasingly important partners for governments.
How relationships among these stakeholders function will powerfully influence Asia's future development.
The Eighteenth Brumaire of Arnold Schwarzenegger
Replacing a governor whom they re-elected only a year before with Arnold Schwarzenegger must have given Californian voters an enormous--if guilty--pleasure.
Some members of the opposition in Germany would dearly love to do the same to Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, though they have not (yet!
) found a film star to replace him.
Several other European governments find themselves in a similar state of unpopularity not long after being elected.
Beyond Europe this is true even for the recently acclaimed Brazilian President Luis Inacio "Lula" da Silva, to say nothing of Mexican President Vicente Fox and South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun, the latter having called for a referendum to help arrest his sinking popularity.
Electoral success, it appears, fades fast nowadays.
So should every country adopt a recall procedure to maintain the legitimacy of governments?
Absolutely not.
Democracy, in the words of the philosopher Karl Popper, is about being able to remove those in power without violence; it is in this sense about trial and error.
But leaders must be given the chance to govern.
Indeed, they need a chance to make mistakes and to learn and recover from their errors, as long as their decisions do not affect the foundations of the democratic order itself.
Trial and error implies the opportunity to err before we try again.
Californian voters' first mistake is thus what may be called "the lure of the immediate"--none too surprising in a state where instant gratification is supposedly a core value.
But sometimes this desire seems overwhelming in post-modern democracies everywhere.
Indeed, democracy nowadays has embraced a pop culture of rapidly passing fads; today's hysteria-generating pop group is forgotten tomorrow, and there are always more waiting in the wings.
In politics this can be dangerous, because it encourages basing decisions, no matter how weighty, on whatever popular opinion momentarily prevails.
The call for more referenda both reflects and fuels this trend.
Referenda are for the most part snapshots.
Switzerland, with its generally slower pace and its thorough political debates before votes are held, may be the exception.
As a rule however, referenda measure the popularity of political leaders at a particular moment, regardless of the issue at stake.
If and when Britain votes on joining the Euro, the result will most likely tell us all sorts of things about Tony Blair and about the European Union, but little about the merits of the common currency.
So the case for representative government remains strong.
Democracy is government by debate, by taking important decisions after thorough deliberation of the kind that--at least in large countries--must be conducted in a parliament through elected representatives.
Sometimes parliaments wish to act quickly, and perhaps must do so, but as a rule they take enough time to examine issues fully.
Parliaments talk before reaching conclusions; hence their name.
Consider Germany, where some leaders of the opposition Christian Democrats yearn to sink the Schröder government.
Clearly, the reforms proposed and already partly enacted by the government are unpopular, and there is little doubt that, a year after their re-election, the coalition of the Social Democrats and the Greens would not stand much of a chance at the polls.
But who knows what the electorate will think in three years, at the end of the government's full term in office?
By the time of the next regularly scheduled election, it could become clear that there were no real alternatives to Schröder's policies, and it could even be the case that the predicted beneficial effects of painful reforms will become apparent by then.
Leadership needs time to take and implement unpopular decisions as well as popular ones.
Leaders themselves need the nerve to take often precarious parliamentary majorities through the troughs of popularity.
This is why they should commit their cruelest deeds in the first year and soften up as the next election approaches.
The uneasy partnership of Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown is a good example of this tactic.
Leaders who never risk their popularity are not worth their position.
So California has set a bad example, and Californians will probably pay a heavy price for it.
They may not pay as heavy a price as France a century and a half ago, when the popularly elected Louis Napoleon transformed himself, via a wildly popular referendum, into Napoleon III--that vote being the last the French would enjoy until the end of the Second Empire.
Californians, of course, won't be disenfranchised, but their willfulness threatens to yield a wayward and irresponsible form of state politics.
To be sure, democracy implies limiting the time that the powerful have to exercise their power without challenge.
An effective democracy must give them enough time to win the support of those elected to legislate and to carry out their program.
These two imperatives are inherently contradictory, but the balance between them is still best achieved through representative, parliamentary democracy.
Anything else is likely to be about as stable as this week's top ten pop songs.
Herbert Hoover and the Stability Pact
In mid-July the great-and-good finance ministers of the European Monetary Union (EMU) gathered to consider the euro zone's economic condition.
They ruminated over the most recent economic forecast, which projects annual GDP growth in the euro zone this year at a pathetically anemic 0.7%.
Then, to a minister, without exception, they all but decided that their economies should suffer more of the same, if not worse.
They reiterated their commitment to the Stability and Growth Pact, which requires euro-zone countries to raise taxes and cut spending, putting even more downward pressure on their economies.
The Pact is already knocking Germany into recession, and Italy's government is struggling to revise its growth forecasts fast enough to keep up with falling output.
But none of this is apparently enough to force officials to re-examine their priorities.
Some EU finance ministers still view the Stability Pact as the ``cornerstone'' of EMU.
Others talk of the importance of obeying the ``rules of the game.''
Still others say that while it is clearly essential to restore economic growth, the recovery must occur ``within the spirit of the Pact.''
From the American side of the Atlantic, all of these rationales seem utterly bizarre.
The last time an American government tried to ensure a balanced budget in the face of a recession was over seventy years ago, during the presidency of Herbert Hoover at the outset of the Great Depression.
Since then the broad consensus in the US has been that cyclical economic distress requires the use of budget deficits to ameliorate suffering, stimulate aggregate demand, and hasten recovery.
Economists call these cyclical fiscal boosts ``automatic stabilizers.''
When private incomes fall, so do public revenues.
The reduction in tax collection can increase disposable income.
But, more importantly, when private incomes fall, government social-welfare expenditures rise, sparking a recovery in demand, output, investment, and employment.
The fall in taxes and the rise in spending do widen the budget deficit, but in a healthy and useful way.
On the American side of the Atlantic, the usefulness of these automatic fiscal stabilizers is unchallenged.
On the contrary, whenever recession threatens, political debate revolves around whether they need to be reinforced by
Nor is it even a fiscal discipline issue.
Whenever proposals have surfaced for some sort of balanced-budget amendment to the US Constitution, proponents have typically included exemptions not just for war, but also for recessions.
We know the origins of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Northern European countries--particularly Germany and the Netherlands--prided themselves on traditionally maintaining moderate debt-to-GDP ratios and relatively low interest rates.
These countries saw that Southern European countries--Italy and Greece were the biggest worries--traditionally had high debt-to-GDP ratios and relatively high nominal interest rates because of their perceived tolerance of inflation.
The Northern European countries feared that deficit spending by the South might ultimately create pressure for partial monetization of their debt through inflation of the euro--or, more precisely, their leaders feared that investors, fearing the same thing, would demand higher interest rates.
The Stability and Growth Pact was intended to keep the public debts of southern Europe low, and thus keep interest rates low by reassuring investors that national debts would never be allowed to rise high enough to generate serious inflationary pressures.
But if you look at the euro zone's economic problems today, the danger of high long-term nominal interest rates does not even rank among investors' top ten concerns.
At the very least, investors clearly do not fear that high debt will lead governments to stoke inflation by printing more money.
The EU's problems are stagnant output, high structural unemployment, weak productivity growth, the wasteful and unfair Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and the forthcoming structural adjustments from the expansion of the EU itself.
From one perspective, it is good that the euro zone's finance ministers are eager to keep their national debts low in the long term: it is a sign that the victories over inflation won in the 1970's will not be casually thrown away.
But it is dangerous to become obsessed with the past.
There is no more certain route to economic disaster than to put on historical blinders.
As Herbert Hoover could attest, when we see only the economic policy problems of a generation ago, we risk missing the hazards that lie directly in front of our eyes.
The Ghosts of Economics Past
In Charles Dicken's great novel "A Christmas Carol," the soulless businessman Ebeneezer Scrooge is tormented by a visit from the Spirit of Christmas Past.
Today, economists are similarly troubled by unwanted ghosts, as they ponder the reappearance of economic ills long thought buried and dead.
From Stephen Roach at Morgan Stanley to Paul Krugman at Princeton, to the Governors of the US Federal Reserve and the senior staff at the European Central Bank, to almost everyone in Japan, economists all over the world are worrying about deflation.
Their thoughts retrace the economic thinking of over fifty years ago, a time when economists concluded that the thing to do with deflation was to avoid it like the plague.
Back in 1933 Irving Fisher --Milton Friedman's predecessor atop America's monetarist school of economists-- announced that governments could prevent deep depressions by avoiding deflation.
Deflation --a steady ongoing decline in prices-- gave businesses and consumers powerful incentives to cut spending and hoard cash.
It reduced the ability of businesses and banks to service their debt, and might trigger a chain of big bankruptcies that would destroy confidence in the financial system, providing further incentives to hoard.
Such strong incentives to hoard rather than spend can keep demand low and falling, and unemployment high and rising, for a much longer time than even the most laissez-faire-oriented politician or economist had ever dared contemplate.
Hence the Keynesian solution: use monetary policy (lower interest rates) and fiscal policy (expanded government spending and reduced taxes) to keep the economy from ever approaching the precipice where deflation becomes possible.
But if this is an issue solved over fifty years ago, why is it haunting us now?
Why is this menace a matter of grave concern in Japan today, and a threat worth worrying about in the US?
In the late 1940s, those present at the creation of the post-World War II international economic order tried to create an international monetary system that would (a) allow for exchange rates stable enough for producers and consumers to escape the risks of excessive and irrational exchange rate fluctuations, (b) allow countries to follow their own domestic macroeconomic policies, and (c) prevent the catastrophic panics affecting not just individual banks but whole countries that produced the destructive international financial crisis of the Great Depression.
The result was the fixed-but-adjustable exchange rate system of Bretton Woods, which over time mutated into the floating-rate system of the 1980s.
Then came the 1990s.
All of a sudden tremendously destructive herd-driven financial crises were back: Mexico, Thailand, Korea, Brazil, and so on looked like nothing as much as the US financial panic of 1873 or the Austrian Creditanstalt crisis of 1931.
Argentina's crisis at the end of 2001 looked remarkably like Argentina's Baring Brothers crisis of 1890 -- save that politicians and international bankers seem to have had a much better idea of what to do to minimize the damage in 1890 than they do today.
But if those who built the post-World War II international monetary system worked to guard against the dangers posed by panic-driven international financial crises, why are these financial devils back?
The truth is that economic policymakers are juggling sets of potential disasters, exchanging the one that appears most threatening for a threat that seems more distant.
In the US, the Bush Administration is skeptical of the stimulative power of monetary policy and wants bigger fiscal deficits to reduce unemployment, hoping that the future dangers posed by persistent deficits -- low investment, slow growth, loss of confidence, uncontrolled inflation and exchange rate depreciation-- can be finessed, or will not become visible until after the Bush team leaves office.
In Europe, the European Central Bank believes that the danger of uncontrolled inflation following a loss of public confidence in its commitment to low inflation outweighs the costs of European employment that is far too high.
In developing countries, capital controls to prevent financial crises are feared as obstacles to attracting the finance necessary for industrialization, and as potential sources of corruption as financial flows somehow pass through the hands of the Vice Minister of Finance's nephew-in-law.
Flexible exchange rates, designed to allow the market to signal when confidence in the currency is declining, also put exporters at a competitive disadvantage against foreign-country producers whose prices aren't batted around by unpredictable exchange rates.
Even the import-substitution policies, now universally scorned, were originally adopted by the developing world for good (as well as bad) reasons: the protectionist shutting-off of developed-country markets during the Great Depression which had disastrous consequences for the developing economies.
The ghosts of economics' past return because the lessons of the present are always oversold.
Politicians and policymakers advance their approach to economics as the "One True Doctrine."
But what they are doing, however, is dealing with the biggest problem of the moment but at the price of removing institutions and policies that policymakers before them had put into place to control problems which they felt to be the most pressing.
Ebeneezer Scrooge's nocturnal visitors were able to convince him of the errors of his ways.
Let's hope that today's economists also learn the lessons of their unwanted ghosts.
In the D-Mark's Shadow
Getting Over the Irish Stew
Justifying Humanitarian Intervention
In 1998, I visited Central Asia's former Soviet republics for talks--concerning the democratic development that was--or should have been--taking place in those newly independent countries.
My hosts were former communist leaders who were now more or less democratically elected presidents.
Each spoke easily about institutions, democratic procedures, and respect for the rule of law.
But human rights were another matter entirely.
In each country, I presented lists of political prisoners and asked about their fates.
In one country, the president immediately decided to free a man accused of plotting a coup.
But even this seeming success was morally ambiguous.
The president had not made a political decision; he had bestowed a personal favor.
I was receiving a gift--itself merely another demonstration of the president's arbitrary exercise of power--not proof of respect for moral principles.
In one country, I spoke with a leader of the Islamic fundamentalist opposition, which had waged a long civil war against the government.
This man now styled himself as chairman of a "Committee of National Reconciliation."
Guards armed to the teeth surrounded him, yet he firmly supported the notion of democratization.
Indeed, he saw it as his surest route to power, because the vast majority of the population thought exactly as he did.
Democracy, he hinted more ominously, would enable him to "eliminate"--he did not dwell on the exact meaning of the word--those who did not.
In such democracies without democrats, "human rights" are more problematic to discuss than procedural formalities, because they are not thought of as "rights" in the legal sense, but merely as pangs of conscience, or else as gifts to be exchanged for something else of value.
This distinction matters because it points to the limited effectiveness of formalized legal norms as a means of promoting human rights.
This gap between human rights and the behavior of rulers has brought about the greatest shift in the conduct of international affairs in our time--the advent of "humanitarian intervention."
It arose initially outside established international institutions and the UN system, originating with the French group, Doctors Without Borders, which deemed human rights to be a value superior to national sovereignty.
Doctors Without Borders introduced the concept of "the right of intervention" in humanitarian disasters, bypassing the strictures of traditional international law.
The international system rather quickly adopted (and transformed) this notion, and numerous humanitarian
NATO's intervention in Kosovo is a precedent that US Secretary of State Colin Powell used to justify the war with Iraq.
But, however compelling the cause of humanitarian military intervention, such actions must be brought under the umbrella of the UN Charter.
Promoting respect for human rights was, after all, the guiding principle behind the UN's establishment.
Its tasks in this area were affirmed in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 1975 Helsinki Accords, which give human rights legal supremacy over the sovereignty of individual states.
Yet a glaring contradiction exists between the universality and supremacy of human rights and the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in states' internal affairs, which are also enshrined in UN documents.
One way to overcome this chasm is to introduce into the UN Charter a new chapter devoted to human rights and to reformulate Chapter IV, which concerns the use of force in international relations.
Moreover, the principle of sovereignty itself needs redefinition.
What the world needs is a system of legal injunctions--bilateral and multilateral agreements, as well as appropriate monitoring and supervisory institutions--to regulate the use of force for humanitarian reasons.
Legal restraints on humanitarian intervention are necessary because dictators too often use it to justify criminal aggression.
Adolf Hitler minted this strategy when he dismantled Czechoslovakia--supposedly in defense of the Sudeten Germans--and later when he invaded my homeland, Poland.
As Milosevic showed again in the 1990s, when he claimed to be defending innocent Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia, justifying military intervention solely on the basis of moral principles leaves too much room for their distortion and abuse.
This is why debates about reforming the Security Council should focus not on changing its composition, but on its mission.
The Council should be made explicitly responsible for "human security" and be given a responsibility to protect it, in addition to its current role in safeguarding more traditional notions of international security.
The principle of non-intervention in a state's internal affairs was never absolute, and globalization confronts it with a radical challenge.
The term "international relations" assumes the Westphalian order of commitments among sovereign nation states, which replaced the medieval order of communities defined by personal fealty to a king.
But today it is the Westphalian order that is in decline, along with the significance of state borders.
In this wider and uncertain context, the need to regulate humanitarian military intervention looms large.
What Does America Want?
When the leaders of the world's richest nations gather in Evian, France, one unasked question will dominate: what does America want in the world?
So it may be helpful to outline the principles and ideas that guide US foreign policy.
First, inconsistency is no vice.
Indeed, in foreign policymaking, inconsistency is often a virtue.
I speak not of principles, but of policy.
The US does not have a "one size fits all" approach to the world.
What happened in Iraq should not be over?interpreted as a rigid template for US policy toward countries that pursue weapons of mass destruction, support terrorism, or deny people liberty.
In Iraq, the US used force as a last resort, against a country with a clear record of aggression, and after a large degree of international consensus had developed about what Iraq needed to do.
Different policies-tailored for local, regional, and international realities-will be needed to meet the challenges posed by North Korea, Iran, Syria, or elsewhere.
America's armed forces are an essential background to much of what the US accomplishes internationally.
But defense policy is only one component of foreign policy.
Not every threat to America's national interests can be addressed with military power.
If all you have to work with is a hammer, as the saying goes, every problem looks like a nail.
Success in foreign policy, as in carpentry, requires the right tools for the job.
Partnership is essential here.
For all of America's power, there is little that the US can do in the world that it can't do better with the active participation of others, be they governments, international organizations, or non-governmental organizations.
Partnership facilitates solutions to problems that defy purely national responses and means that burdens are shared.
America relies on partnerships in the global war on terrorism: foreign governments provide intelligence and law enforcement cooperation; trading partners ensure the security of shipping containers; private financial institutions help track the transfers of funds that sustain terror networks.
Beyond partnerships, international institutions add value-provided they are effectively organized, have realistic mandates, and contain members that are committed to common norms and aims.
Such institutions can and often do advance US national interests.
Indeed, it would be difficult to carry out critical dimensions of US foreign policy-from trade to non?proliferation to environmental policy-without them.
The World Trade Organization is a case in point.
It provides a forum in which to negotiate new trade liberalization agreements, seek remedies against protectionist and discriminatory policies, and resolve disputes with trading partners.
But the US must also ensure that existing institutions are adapted to current realities.
NATO, for example, is evolving from a Cold War alliance focused solely on Europe to one suited to meeting today's security challenges wherever they may arise, such as in Afghanistan and possibly Iraq.
Multilateralism is most successful when built on a real convergence of interests and values.
The UN and other global frameworks may sometimes be best placed to address US foreign policy goals.
When the UN or other bodies are unwilling or unable to move against dire threats, America reserves the right to act in less encompassing alliances or flexible,
This flexibility is needed because of the nature of the challenges that loom on the horizon.
We ignore failing states at our peril, because anarchy creates an environment conducive to extremist ideologies and can offer a haven for terrorists, criminals, and drug traffickers.
One of our most pressing tasks today is to prevent the implosion of weak states.
Another is to assist countries that have collapsed into violence to begin the slow process of recovery.
One impulse behind America's international engagement, and one of the great sources of its global power, has been its enduring impulse to make the world a better place.
Any US foreign policy must combine interests and values, because the American public always insists that US national objectives be linked to national ideals.
The appeal of US leadership abroad rests in part on the attractiveness of America's political institutions, society, and culture, and its willingness to champion human rights and democracy.
At the same time, our efforts to promote democracy worldwide serve US interests, owing to the hardheaded realization that democracies settle their differences peaceably.
Today's world lacks irreconcilable conflict among the main concentrations of world power: Europe, Russia, China, Japan, and the US.
This congruence of interest and agreement on the rules of international order offers a promising foundation for managing the common challenges that confront us all.
Our over?riding goal should be to create a world in which governments, organizations, and peoples embrace arrangements that allow them to realize their shared interests and that reflect fundamental universal values.
Everyone has an interest in a world in which force is used only as a last resort, terrorism is regarded as beyond the pale, weapons of mass destruction do not spread and are not used, free trade becomes the norm, citizens enjoy basic liberties, democratic values triumph, and the rule of law replaces the way of the gun.
Bringing such an integrated world may be optimistic, even idealistic, but it is hardly naive.
The Road to the Double Helix, the Structure of DNA
Fifty years ago, on April 25, 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick published a short letter in the science magazine
A second major advance came a few months later, when Max Perutz discovered a technique to determine the structures of large molecules like myoglobin and hemoglobin.
Since then, X-ray structural analysis of protein molecules has helped us to understand the chemistry of biological reactions.
Both discoveries--DNA structure and protein structure--were made at Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory.
So why were these two foundation stones of the revolution in biology and medicine that dominated science in the second half of the 20th century uncovered in a British
The great breakthroughs of 1953 rested on the strength of experimental physics at Cambridge, beginning in the late 19th century.
This legacy shaped the intellectual environment in which the father-and-son team of William and Lawrence Bragg were trained, and where Lawrence Bragg--first as an undergraduate and then as a research student--developed in 1912 the ideas that led to X-ray structural analysis.
Although Max von Laue, Walter Friedrich, and Paul Knipping had discovered the diffraction of X-rays by crystals, it was Lawrence Bragg who understood how it could be exploited scientifically.
Reflection by "Bragg planes"--sheets of atoms that can diffract X-rays at specific angles that are determined by the separation between sheets--enabled the Braggs to calculate the exact arrangement of sodium and chloride atoms in a crystal of salt.
William Bragg graduated in mathematics in Cambridge in 1884, and became professor of physics in Adelaide, Australia.
In 1909 he returned to Britain to take up a chair at Leeds, continuing his work on the nature of X-rays.
He became director of the Royal Institution in London in 1923, where he attracted some outstanding young scientists interested in the X-ray field.
Among them were two recent Cambridge graduates, William Astbury and John Desmond Bernal, who became interested in the problem of protein structure--Astbury as a result of being asked by Bragg to provide X-ray diagrams of wool and silk.
Bernal moved back to Cambridge as a lecturer in structural crystallography in 1927, and in 1931 was promoted to assistant director of research in crystallography, by then a sub-department of the Cavendish Laboratory.
Bernal's main scientific interest was initially the atomic structure of crystals, metals, and minerals, then of hormones and sterols--and of some amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.
Astbury, meanwhile, moved to Leeds in 1928, where he also began working on amino acids and proteins.
Describing his unsuccessful attempts to obtain well-ordered X-ray diffraction patterns from crystals of the protein pepsin, he wondered whether Bernal could help obtain crystals of other proteins.
A friend of Bernal's named Glenn Millikan had happened to visit a lab in Uppsala, Sweden, where large pepsin crystals had been obtained, and he brought some of the crystals, still in their mother-liquor, back to Cambridge.
Bernal and Dorothy Crowfoot (later Hodgkin) obtained patterns of the dry crystals, as Astbury had, and with similarly disappointing results.
But when Bernal observed the crystals in a light microscope, he noticed that as the large amount of water in the crystal lattice evaporated, they became disordered.
They repeated the X-ray experiment, but with the crystal surrounded by its mother-liquor and sealed in a glass capillary, obtaining patterns with large numbers of crystalline reflections.
The results of this first defining moment in protein crystallography were published as a letter in
Max Perutz, a chemistry graduate from Vienna, arrived in Cambridge in 1935 to work as a graduate student with Bernal.
The next year, he was given excellent hemoglobin crystals and soon produced the best X-ray diffraction patterns to date.
But the observable diffraction pattern--the intensities and positions of the individual reflections--represents only half of the data needed to deduce the structure of the diffracting object.
In mathematical terms, it gives the amplitude, but not the phases--i.e., the stages in an oscillatory motion--without which the atomic positions could not be determined.
With simpler structures made up of small numbers of atoms, chemistry could provide considerable guidance as to the atomic arrangements, and a solution could thus often be found by trial and error.
But proteins, which contain thousands of atoms, were far too complicated for this to work.
So despite the enormous amount of excellent data that was collected, the solution remained tantalizingly out of reach.
But the faith remained that detailed information about protein structure could be obtained from the X-ray patterns in some way, if only it could be discovered.
It was only natural that where chemistry fell short, physics--and its premier laboratory--showed the way forward, a way grasped by Watson and Crick in the epic breakthrough that we celebrate this month.
Worlds Apart
Macroeconomic policies, financial globalization, and changes in labor market institutions have exacerbated inequality in recent decades, not only in income and wealth, but also in access to education, healthcare, social protection, as well as in political participation and influence.
Even within countries experiencing rapid economic growth, an array of factors, exacerbated by tremendous demographic changes, has conspired to transmit inequality of knowledge, social responsibility, and life chances from one generation to the next.
As surveyed in the United Nations report The Inequality Predicament, few countries, rich or poor, have proved immune to the global trend of rising inequality, or to its consequences for education, health, and social welfare.
Of course, there is no simple causal relationship linking poverty and inequality to violence.
But inequality and a sense of deprivation do contribute to resentment and social instability, threatening security.
Excluded and facing bleak life prospects, young people, in particular, often experience anomie and may turn to anti-social behavior, including violence.
Nor is there a simple explanation of what causes poverty.
Clearly, however, poverty arises from various complex conditions, and its amelioration requires a multidimensional approach.
It is hard to imagine, for example, how to "make poverty history" without also generating enough decent work, educational opportunities, and healthcare for all.
To be sure, the world has seen progress on some fronts in recent decades.
Access to education for girls has improved, and some gender gaps have been reduced.
Despite AIDS and the resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis, life expectancy has increased in much of the world due to improved public health systems.
Overall, however, the inequality gaps are large and, in many cases, growing.
The most important determinant of income inequality today is wealth inequality, with the increasing concentration of asset ownership in recent years principally responsible for greater income inequality in most countries.
Meanwhile, growing unemployment, widening skill and productivity gaps, and the "informalization" or "casualization" of labor markets have exacerbated income inequalities worldwide, as the number of "working poor" and the incidence of "jobless growth" has spread.
Nor have stabilization and structural adjustment programs, imposed since the 1980's, delivered on their promise of achieving higher economic growth.
Growth in much of the world during the past quarter-century has been slower than in the previous 25 years, despite more rapid growth in East Asia, India, and a few other countries.
Such growth differences suggest that overall global inequality may not have increased unequivocally.
But inequalities at the national level have deepened in most countries in recent years, largely due to economic liberalization at both the national and international levels.
Indeed, in much of the world, such economic reforms have actually undermined growth rates as well as the progressive role of government, while otherwise increasing overall inequalities.
The few exceptions have been due largely to continued or new progressive government interventions.
But they are exceptions: the cumulative impact of these reforms over the past 25 years has been greater inequality in most developed and developing countries, with rising unemployment, greater earnings disparities, reduced social protection, and environmental degradation.
International financial liberalization, for example, has undermined the use of more inclusive and targeted developmental credit to promote desired economic activities.
In addition, contrary to the promises of its proponents, financial liberalization has actually resulted in net capital flows from the capital-poor to the capital-rich over the long term, while increasing financial volatility and weakening economic activity.
Meanwhile, free-trade negotiations seem to ignore historical trends.
Developing countries' international terms of trade have worsened: prices of primary commodities have declined in relation to manufactures, as have tropical agriculture prices against temperate agriculture, and prices of generic manufactures have fallen relative to output protected by intellectual property rights.
As a result, trade liberalization of manufactures has resulted in de-industrialization and greater unemployment in much of the world, as in the case of garments this year.
And, while agricultural trade liberalization may enhance export earnings for some poor countries, the main beneficiaries will be the more well-to-do agricultural exporters.
Countries that import currently subsidized food will be worse off.
The "retreat of the state" in much of the developing world in recent decades has involved a generally reduced role for government, including the capacity to lead and sustain development, as well as its progressive social interventions in areas such as public education, health, housing, and utilities.
The economic liberalization carried out in much of the world in the last 25 years was a flawed policy from the start, and its consequences have become glaringly obvious.
Unless the world refocuses economic policies to address the adverse impact of economic inequality on growth and poverty reduction, the poor and the privileged will continue to live worlds apart.
Don't Follow The Fed
The US Federal Reserve faces a dilemma, for it needs to continue raising interest rates in the face of a hurricane-devastated economy.
The Fed's failure to raise rates earlier thus holds a powerful lesson for the European Central Bank: after a prolonged period of monetary stability at unusually low interest rates, waiting too long to raise rates to more normal and appropriate levels holds dangerous consequences.
The Fed was late in beginning the interest-rate normalization process, and it is now paying a price.
The ECB must not make the same mistake, even bearing in mind that the two central banks operate in different milieus and under different constraints.
Warning signs of impending inflation abound across the euro zone.
Money-supply growth has been well above target levels for some time now, indicating excess liquidity.
September headline inflation, at 2.6%, is above the ECB's 2% target ­ -- as is the latest forecast for 2006 inflation (updated forecasts will be released at the beginning of December).
"The period of wage moderation may be coming to an end," warns Otmar Issing, the ECB's chief economist, implying that soaring energy prices may now be feeding through into the overall price level (so-called "second-round effects").
In these circumstances, there is no good reason to wait to raise interest rates.
The longer energy prices remain at their current lofty levels, the greater the probability that inflationary expectations will increase and that second-round effects will materialize.
Further procrastination on interest-rate normalization by the ECB could well lead to a nasty bout of inflation.
This would be disastrous for Europe's economic recovery, as the ECB would have no choice but to slam down hard on the monetary brakes.
No one wants this.
Better a 50-basis-point increase now -- thereby allowing the economic recovery to continue by keeping inflation in check -- than triple or quadruple that figure down the road.
The old adage that "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" applies with particular force to monetary policy.
Judging from the outcome of last month's meeting of the ECB's Governing Council, that "ounce of prevention" appears to be right around the corner for the euro-zone economy.
Indeed, the pace of ECB warnings about the risks of inflation has quickened in recent months -- the earlier "We are vigilant" became "We are particularly vigilant" in September, which became "Strong vigilance with regard to upside risks to price stability is warranted" in October.
The Governing Council is in danger of running out of adjectives -- as well as credibility -- if it does not act soon.
The tone of ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet's comments in the Q & A section of the press conference following the October meeting was unusually hawkish.
Trichet appeared to be calling for a pre-emptive approach when he said, "We must not allow second-round effects to materialize."
For the first time, the ECB president was willing to admit publicly that the Governing Council had discussed the pros and cons of a rate hike at the meeting.
Nonetheless, current interest rates were described as "still appropriate" in October, signaling that the ECB has not yet reached a decision to bite the bullet.
To be sure, an unexpected slowdown in economic activity or a strong rise in the value of the euro could postpone the inevitable rate hike.
But what seems clear is that the ECB used the October press conference to warn politicians, trade unions, and the markets that its long period of monetary-policy inactivity is coming to an end.
The exit process has begun.
Not everyone is happy with this news.
Politicians -- like Jacques Chirac in France, Silvio Berlusconi in Italy, and ECOFIN (the finance ministers of the European Union's member states) -- continue to press for fixed, even lower, interest rates.
But it's easy for politicians to be irresponsible about monetary policy.
They are not the ones who will be blamed for soaring prices, nor are they the ones who will have to force the inflation genie back into the bottle.
By constantly pushing for lower interest rates than the ECB can deliver, politicians set the central bank up as a scapegoat for Europe's poor economic performance.
Europe is doing badly, they argue, not because of their own failure to lead the structural reform process, but because interest rates are too high.
At the same time, the ECB does not need to go nearly as far as the Fed, which has raised interest rates in increments of 25 basis points at 12 consecutive meetings, with still more to come.
For the ECB, an increase of 50 basis points could do the job at this point -- after which rates could probably be put on hold for some time.
The Fed waited too long to start the normalization process, and, because it was more aggressive in lowering rates in the downward phase of the interest-rate cycle, it has had to be more aggressive in raising them in the upward phase.
This is not the type of volatile monetary policy that Europe wants or needs.
The West Versus the Rest?
The Madrid bombings have made Europeans feel the scourge of terrorism in their bones.
March 11 is now Europe's version of September 11 in America.
Yet America and Europe often do not seem to see the world through the same glasses: Spain's response to the terrorist attacks - a threat common to all democracies - was to vote in a government promising an end to pro-US policy on Iraq.
Does this mean that Europe and the US have dramatically different visions?
Part of the seeming disconnect on foreign policy emerges from a misunderstanding about what "Europe" is about.
The European project is a realist's response to globalization and its challenges.
It was initiated to create "solidarités de fait," promote political stability, and consolidate democracy and Europe's social model.
Having achieved these goals, Europe now wants to make a positive contribution to world developments.
This is not nostalgia for past glory.
An unprecedented degree of solidarity now exists across Europe, as was apparent in the collective mourning and outpouring of sympathy towards Spain; we must build on that huge potential to create a logic of solidarity in the world.
The US, also victim of a horrendous attack, feels drawn to the world but not to promote a similar model of cooperation.
Rather, in defending their values and security, Americans strive to defend the world, especially the Western world, from dark new threats.
The messianic idealism that liberated Europe from Nazism and protected Western Europe from communism is now directed at other enemies.
With all the attention devoted to strained transatlantic relations, it is easy to overlook how often our preoccupations overlap.
On issues such as terrorism, weapons proliferation, Iran, Afghanistan (where we jointly train the country's future army), and Africa (where French initiatives with American support recently succeeded in stabilizing Côte d'Ivoire and Congo), Europe and the US speak with a common voice.
But on some issues, such as the Iraq war, Europeans are not all ready to follow America blindly.
The world - Europe in particular - has fascination and admiration for the US.
But today we must move away from fascination and gratitude and realize that the pursuit of European integration remains in the best interest of the US, which has supported it for 50 years.
In today's world, there is clearly work for two to bring about stability and security, and in promoting common values.
In particular, the Franco-German "engine" of Europe should not be seen as a potential rival to the US.
France and Germany are not an axis aspiring to be some sort of an alternative leadership to the US.
Rather, the two countries form a laboratory needed for the internal working of the EU.
Anyone who thinks we are building a European rival to America has not looked properly at the facts.
Indeed, France and Germany do not get along naturally.
Much sets us apart: EU enlargement, agriculture, and domestic market issues.
So it is not the
So I do not believe that a lasting rift looms.
Most Americans still see in Europe a partner with largely the same aims in the world.
Most Europeans see in America a strong friend.
We are all allies of the US; our draft constitution restates the importance of the NATO link; our strategy for growth and our contribution to global stability depend on the irreplaceable nature of our relationship with America.
This is why the US should encourage the development of a common European security and defense policy, which is merely the burden sharing that America has been pressing on Europe for decades.
We must forge greater European military capacities simply to put in place a mechanism that allows us to stand effectively shoulder to shoulder when terrorism or other catastrophes strike one of our democracies, as just happened.
But we must also establish an autonomous European military planning capacity, because the EU might need to lead its own operations, perhaps because NATO is unwilling to.
We French are opposed to building a "two-speed" Europe.
But we want structured co-operation - meaning that some European states may press ahead in defense capacity - because we are not prepared to let the more cautious and hesitant dictate a recurrence of the Balkan tragedy of the 1990's, when Europeans couldn't act and Americans wouldn't (for a while).
The creation of such a capacity will make the EU a more effective transatlantic partner.
So it is hard for Europeans to understand why plans for closer European integration should be seen as anti-American.
The only way to arrest such fears is through closer and more frequent dialogue.
On defense and security matters, the EU's security doctrine provides a great opportunity to build on our common worries: terrorism and non-proliferation, but also the need to ensure sustainable development in all quarters of the world.
Europe and the US must pursue their aims in cooperation, while ensuring that such cooperation never becomes an alliance of the "West against the Rest."
Some in the West have tried to conjure a "Clash of Civilizations" out of our troubled times.
Our task is to find a way to stand together without standing against anybody in particular.
Is India Ready for Full Currency Convertibility?
India's political boldness in seeking peace with Pakistan in their half-century twilight struggle for Kashmir may soon be matched by economic moves equally as daring.
Indeed, India is edging toward a truly bold reform: full international convertibility of the rupee.
How it goes about this will not only effect India's economic development, but provide object lessons for China as it ponders convertibility in the years ahead.
Since 1991 India has been travelling on a path from rupee devaluation to full convertibility, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) relaxing a range of foreign-exchange controls.
Resident Indians can now maintain a foreign-currency account and invest in shares of foreign companies, while non-resident Indians can repatriate legacy/inheritance assets.
Indian companies listed abroad can buy property in foreign countries, and resident firms will be allowed to pre-pay external commercial debt up to US$100 million.
Limits on exporters' foreign-currency accounts will be removed, and banks may invest in overseas money and debt markets.
Is India ready for full convertibility?
The government is still lagging on its domestic economic reforms.
Structural reform and privatization have slowed, eroding investors' confidence.
But failure to address structural problems could expose the economy to external shocks in the long term.
Hence it would be premature for India to open up its capital account immediately.
Exchange rate stability is the key anchor when a country's reform process is underway.
There is, however, little evidence that capital account convertibility has a meaningful impact on a country's growth rate.
With capital-account convertibility, the rupee's exchange rate will be determined more by capital flows than by inflation differentials, as India's inflation rate remains broadly in line with the OECD average of around 3%.
Because India is still running a trade deficit, there could be some pressure on the rupee following any negative shock.
Although monetary growth is more than twice the rate of real GDP growth, the inflationary risk is probably low because substantial excess capacity exists.
Indeed, throughout the 1990s, despite rising output, deflation occurred, which means that India's potential output is expanding.
The moves towards full capital-account convertibility have proceeded in step with impressive growth in India's foreign-currency reserves.
Indeed, India's external liquidity position has strengthened dramatically in the past decade.
As a result of a current-account surplus and an interest-rate differential of 3-4%, foreign reserves reached $70.3 billion by the end of 2002--enough to cover almost 15 months of imports--up from only US$4 billion in 1990.
Following the 1991 balance of payments crisis, the rupee's exchange rate was devalued around 20%.
Exporters could exchange 30% of their earnings at the market rate.
This was subsequently replaced with a two-tier exchange-rate system making the rupee partially convertible--60% of export earnings could be converted at the market exchange rate, and the rest at the RBI's fixed rate (used by the government to finance essential imports like petroleum, cooking oil, fertilizers, and life-saving drugs).
The two-tier exchange-rate system acted as an export tax, but it did not survive for long, giving way to a unified exchange rate on the trade account.
Full convertibility on the current account followed in August 1994.
The policy debate then turned to capital-account convertibility, with the IMF and the World Bank strongly in favor.
In May 1997, the Tarapore Committee on Capital Account Convertibility charted a three-stage liberalization process to be completed by 1999-2000, with an accompanying emphasis on fiscal consolidation, a mandated inflation target, and a strong financial system.
Then the East Asian currency crisis put further action on hold and raised serious questions about when--and whether--to proceed.
The sudden meltdown of apparently healthy economies served as a stark reminder that strong external liquidity should not be the driving force towards full convertibility.
The downside risk of capital-account liberalization, after all, is higher exchange-rate volatility, and even countries with sound liquidity positions could not prevent a run on their reserves.
The lesson for India is that, in the event of a domestic or external shock, full convertibility could prove to be a costly, short-lived experiment.
The fundamental question is whether full convertibility will encourage higher net inflows or outflows of capital.
The downside risk of higher volatility for the rupee is aggravated by some serious problems, including a deficit running at 6% of GDP and the strategic stand-off with Pakistan.
Short-term capital outflows--which might occur should either risk worsen--could create greater output volatility.
So it is vital for India to increase the inward flow of long-term capital, regardless of whether the capital account is closed or open.
In this context, it is noteworthy that China, with a closed capital account, has foreign-exchange reserves of US$286 billion, four times the size of India's, though China's economy is only double India's size.
Nor is full convertibility the key to attracting higher inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI).
China attracted FDI inflows of US$52.7 billion in 2002--the largest in the world.
India needs to attract higher FDI inflows to help soak up the economy's excess capacity.
This underscores the importance for India's financial stability of successful management of the capital account (monitoring inflows and outflows) following any move toward full convertibility.
But, in the near term, full capital account convertibility is not in India's interest.
Twilight of the Chancellor?
Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's resignation as chairman of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) will deeply affect the distribution of forces within the German government and its slim "Red-Green" majority in Parliament.
While it seems to be premature to speak, as some in Germany now do, of a "Twilight of the Chancellor" or to call Schröder's surprising step "the beginning of the end" of his tenure, it is perfectly correct to describe it as a dramatic loss of power.
The immediate winner is Franz Müntefering, age 64, the SPD's parliamentary floor leader who will succeed Schröder, as party chairman.
Both politicians will constitute a tandem, but Schröder will be more dependent on Müntefering's loyalty than Müntefering is dependent on Schröder's success.
Schröder has been representing a moderately left political platform and agenda, one comparable to British Prime Minister Tony Blair's New Labour philosophy or former US President Bill Clinton's centrism.
Müntefering, however, is more attached to traditional Social Democratic (or Old Labour) values.
In terms of leadership style, Schröder is a soloist; Müntefering a team player.
In Germany, the Chancellor holds the strongest position among the key political players.
However, the main source of any German Chancellor's strength is not to be found in the legal powers conferred upon him by the constitution; it is the actual support he holds within his own party.
With one notable exception in the 1950's, none of Germany's two main political parties - the Social Democrats and the moderately conservative Christian Democrats - has ever managed to win an absolute majority in Parliament.
As a consequence, German Chancellors usually preside over coalition governments, and their effective authority is based on the loyalty of the party forces they command within such political alliances.
Although the Social Democrats never really liked Schröder (they certainly do not love him in the way they did the unforgettable Willy Brandt), they willy-nilly followed him so long as they saw him as the only guarantor of electoral success after 16 frustrating years (1982-1998) in opposition to Helmut Kohl.
But this is no longer the case.
Since the end of 2002, Schröder and the SPD have been facing unusually low public approval ratings - and this pattern is not likely to change soon.
In 2003 alone, almost 40,000 Social Democrats left their party, a hemorrhaging previously unheard of.
If national elections had, say, been held last Sunday, February 8, a centre-right coalition consisting of the Christian Democrats and the Liberals would have won 57% of the vote, according to "Infratest dimap," one of Germany's main polling institutes.
With no more than 35% of the vote, Schröder's "Red-Green" coalition would have suffered a disaster.
At the beginning of what has been dubbed a "super election year" in Germany - with 14 elections, one at the European, five at the regional, and eight at the local levels - this is hideously bad news for the SPD.
Several times before, Schröder had been thoroughly energized by desperate situations when he stood with his back to the wall.
This quality is his greatest strength, and it seems he has now embarked on his riskiest counteroffensive ever.
It is based on the bet that there will be a considerable economic upswing from mid-2004 onwards until the next national elections in autumn 2006 - and that voters will attribute the expected recovery to the economic, labour market and welfare state reforms, called "Agenda 2010," that Schröder has made the hallmark of his chancellorship.
For a long time, Schröder's reformist rhetoric had not been matched by his politics.
Only after his re-election in autumn 2002, did he give up his previous populist stance, short-term responses and neo-corporatist ways of trying to talk trade unions and employers' associations into compromise.
In view of Germany's most pressing problems - an accelerating demographic decline, an overregulated labour market, and a cloudy and confusing tax system - Schröder's reform agenda may look far too timid, but many cuts have been perceived as extremely cruel by the SPD's core constituency, especially the powerful labour unions.
But, given Germany's economic distress, which looks likely to worsen given the country's demographic problems, the Social Democrats are now condemned to give wealth creation priority over redistribution.
Germany cannot afford to slow down or, worse yet, stop the reform process.
In the best case scenario, Schröder will therefore stick to the "Agenda 2010" philosophy, and Müntefering will patiently explain to a reluctant SPD that you have to cross the desert in order to make it to the Promised Land.
In the worst case, Schröder will lapse back into populism for the sake of short-term electoral success, and Müntefering will confirm that method so as to save the wounded Social Democratic soul from total despair.
Schröder's tragedy is that his power may further erode whatever way he chooses.
At the end of this current "super election year," we will know the answer.
The Great Man Syndrome
In our globalized age, vast impersonal forces are supposed to determine events.
Globalized markets, unfettered trade, militant Islam, China's awakening: these are the things historians and strategists usually portray as the key forces shaping our destiny.
But most people don't see things this way.
Instead, most people still instinctively look at "great men" as the agents of history, the men (and women) who seem to forge events through their political vision, personal charisma, and the force of their moral claims.
By sheer force of conviction and personality, such figures, many of us believe, can carry the day, bringing a glimmer of hope to an otherwise detached and impersonal universe.
This yearning for providential men or women in our global age results from at least three factors.
The first concerns the complexity and vulnerability of our world.
The second, paradoxically, reflects our growing cynicism towards politics and politicians.
And the third is the result of our media culture, obsessed as it is with putting a "face" to events.
Confronted with the problem of bringing about positive changes in a domestic or international environment that seems to defy the power of "normal" leaders, one looks for new Alexanders to untie the "Gordian knot" and transcend complexity by sheer force of will and dynamism.
For example, structural reforms in Europe are thought impossible to enact unless imposed by some reincarnation of Margaret Thatcher.
In the Middle East, everyone waits for a new Anwar Sadat to arise among the Arabs.
Disillusion with politics and politicians also is a key element of our yearning for providential leaders.
In France for example, the overly flattering commemoration of President François Mitterrand's death ten years ago primarily reflects widespread disillusion with his successor, Jacques Chirac.
Indirect criticism of the present is usually a key element in idealized views of the past.
The less we expect from a "normal" politician, the more we look for a hero.
With the world becoming a global stage, the media's role in fueling the appetite for providential leaders is essential.
The public demands quick answers to complex problems that, unsolved, risk endangering the planet.
They need figures with whom they can identify, immediately recognize, and, above all, trust.
The emergence of an embryonic "world civil society" heightens demand for universal and charismatic figures, holding out the hope of global accountability, but also carrying populist overtones.
In a world searching for providential leaders, the case of Ariel Sharon is both symbolic and paradoxical, for this universal man remains one of the most controversial figures of recent decades.
He has become a nearly revered figure in his country, and large segments of Western public opinion believe that his political demise represents a potentially fatal blow to any hope of progress in the region, even as he remains hated in large parts of the Arab and Muslim world.
Sharon's transformation from villain to hero within the space of a mere few years is a source of fascination for his people, the region, and the world -- all the more so because his ultimate intentions will remain a subject of endless dispute among historians tomorrow and among politicians claiming to be his faithful heirs today.
Was Sharon really convinced by demographers that the "Great Israel" that once seemed to be his dream would actually mean the end of a Jewish State, or did his disengagement strategy of "Gaza first" really mean "Gaza last"?
For those who support one or the other reading, Sharon will forever hold the benefit of the doubt.
That Sharon's stroke could be compared -- in terms of political consequences -- with the assassination of Yitzak Rabin demonstrates that his personality had become associated with hope and security.
The "bulldozer" had become the grandfather of most Israelis and the last card of Western diplomacy, for Americans and, surprisingly, for Europeans, too.
He alone seemed to incarnate the combination of reassuring strength and vision to carry the majority of Israelis behind him in a process of unilateral disengagement.
In fact, one may wonder if the world has made of Sharon a providential man because it wanted so much to believe that there was still "hope around the corner" in the Middle East.
Was this wishful thinking or self-fulfilling prophecy?
We will never know.
What is certain is that the vacuum left by Sharon's departure from politics is all the more striking in view of the images of chaos emerging from the Gaza that Israel has vacated, and the collapse of the Palestinian authority before our eyes.
Nor will the emergence of another providential figure come easily.
Not all exceptional periods create their Bonapartes, and this is probably a good thing, for exceptional leaders may give the illusion that all problems have solutions, which is far from true.
The natural course of history in the most optimistic sense is progress "at the margin," but the rapid pace of technological change is pushing us to expect equally rapid progress in human affairs.
Many of us believe that such an impossible wager can be fulfilled only by a providential man, with all the hopes -- and dangers -- that this entails.
The Fall of the UN
Saddam Hussein's reign of terror is about to end.
His Ba'athist government, however, will not go alone.
In a fitting irony, the United Nations is going down with him.
Perhaps the entire UN will not disappear.
Those parts devoted to "good works" (i.e., the low-risk peacekeeping bureaucracies or those that fight AIDs and malaria or protect children) will remain.
The looming chatterbox on New York's East River will also continue to bleat.
What died with the Security Council's unwillingness to sanction force to implement its own resolutions on Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction was the decades-old fantasy of the UN as the bedrock of world order.
As we sift the debris of the war to liberate Iraq, it will be important to preserve-the better to understand-the intellectual wreckage of the liberal conceit of security through international law administered by international institutions.
As free Iraqis document the quarter-century nightmare of Saddam's rule, we must not forget who supported this war and who did not, who held that the international community's moral authority was enshrined in pleas for more time for the UN arms inspectors, and who marched against "regime change".
In the spirit of post-war reconciliation that diplomats are always keen to engender, we must not reconcile ourselves to the timid, blighted notion that world order requires us to recoil before rogue states that terrorize their citizens and menace our own.
Decent, thoughtful, high-minded, the millions who marched against holding Iraq to account were catalyzed by the idea that only the UN Security Council has the authority to legitimize the resort to force.
A voluntary coalition of liberal democracies willing to put their own soldiers in harm's way isn't good enough.
It does not seem to matter that such troops are being used to enforce the UN's own demands.
If a country or coalition of countries other than the UN Security Council uses force, even as a last resort, "anarchy", not international law, would prevail, destroying all hope of world order.
Or so the protestors believed.
But this is a dangerously wrong idea, an idea that leads inexorably to handing great moral (and even existential politico-military decisions) to the likes of Syria, Cameroon, Angola, Russia, China, and France.
If a policy is right when the Security Council approves, how can it be wrong just because communist China or Russia or France or a gaggle of minor dictatorships withhold approbation?
Those who opposed the actions of the coalition in Iraq usually fall back on the answer that "order" must have primacy over "anarchy".
But is this right?
Is the UN Security Council the institution most capable of ensuring order and saving us from anarchy?
History suggests not.
The UN arose from the ashes of a war that the League of Nations was unable to avert.
The League was simply not up to confronting Italy in Abyssinia, much less (had it survived that debacle) taking on Nazi Germany.
In the euphoric aftermath of the victory in World War Two, the hope that security could be made collective was reposed in the UN Security Council-with abject results.
During the Cold War the Security Council was hopelessly paralyzed.
Indeed, the decision to defend South Korea from attack in 1950 was taken by the Council only because Stalin ordered his diplomats to boycott UN proceedings, which meant that no Soviet ambassador was around to cast a veto.
It was a mistake the Soviets would not make again.
In both 1967 and 1973, with war looming, the UN withdrew from the Middle East, leaving Israel to defend itself.
The Soviet empire was wrestled to the ground, and Eastern Europe liberated, not by the UN but by the mother of all coalitions, NATO.
Facing Milosevic's multiple aggressions, the UN could not stop the Balkan wars or even protect its victims.
Remember Sarajevo?
Remember Srebrenica and the slaughter of thousands of Muslims under the supposed protection of the UN?
It took a coalition of the willing to save Bosnia from extinction.
When the war was over, peace was made in Dayton, Ohio, not at the UN.
The rescue of Kosovo's Muslims was not a UN action: their cause never gained Security Council approval.
This century now challenges the hopes for a new world order in new ways.
We will not defeat or even contain fanatical terror unless we can carry the war to the territories from which it is launched.
This will sometimes require that we use force against states that harbor terrorists, as we did in destroying the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.
The most dangerous of these states are those that possess weapons of mass destruction, the chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons that can kill not hundreds or thousands but hundreds of thousands.
Iraq was such a state, but there are others.
Whatever hope exists that they can be persuaded to withdraw support or sanctuary from terrorists rests on the certainty and effectiveness with which they are confronted.
The chronic failure of the Security Council to enforce its own resolutions (with respect to Iraq) is unmistakable: it is simply not up to the task.
So we are left with coalitions of the willing.
Far from disparaging them as a threat to a new world order, we should recognize that they are, by default, the best hope for that order, and the true alternative to the anarchy caused by the dismal failure of the United Nations.
After Neoliberalism, What?
Two decades of applying neoliberal economic policies to the developing world have yielded disappointing results.
Latin America, the region that tried hardest to implement the "Washington Consensus" recipes--free trade, price deregulation, and privatization--has experienced low and volatile growth, with widening inequalities.
Among the former socialist economies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, few have caught up with real output levels that prevailed before 1990.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, most economies failed to respond to the adjustment programs demanded by the IMF and World Bank.
The few instances of success occurred in countries that marched to their own drummers--and that are hardly poster children for neoliberalism.
China, Vietnam, India: all three violated virtually every rule in the neoliberal guidebook, even as they moved in a more market-oriented direction.
It is time to abandon neoliberalism and the Washington Consensus.
But the challenge is to provide an alternative set of policy guidelines for promoting development, without falling into the trap of promulgating yet another impractical blueprint, supposedly right for all countries at all times.
The record suggests that an adequate growth program needs to be anchored in two strategies: an investment strategy designed to kick-start growth in the short term, and an institution-building strategy designed to provide an economy with resilience in the face of adverse shocks.
The key to investment strategy is to get domestic entrepreneurs excited about the home economy.
Encouraging foreign investment or liberalizing everything and then waiting for things to improve does not work.
An effective strategy must accomplish two tasks: encourage investment in non-traditional areas, and weed out projects and investments that fail.
For this, governments must deploy both the carrot and the stick.
Learning what a country is (or can be) good at producing is a key challenge of economic development.
The carrot is needed because there is great social value in discovering, for example, that cut flowers, or soccer balls, or computer software can be produced at low cost, because this knowledge can orient the investments of other entrepreneurs.
The entrepreneur who makes the initial "discovery" can capture only a small part of the social value that this knowledge generates, as other entrepreneurs will quickly emulate him.
Consequently, entrepreneurship of this type--learning what can be produced--will typically be under-supplied in the absence of non-market incentives.
In turn, the stick is needed to ensure that these incentives do not lock in unproductive and wasteful investments.
Implementing such a strategy may differ from country to country, depending on administrative capacity, the prevailing incentive regime, the flexibility of the fiscal system, the degree of sophistication of the financial sector, and the underlying political economy.
Time-bound subsidy schemes, public venture funds, and export subsidization are some of the ways in which this approach can be implemented, but there are many others.
No single instrument will work everywhere.
Governments without adequate capacity to exercise leadership over their private sectors are likely to mess things up rather than improve allocation of resources.
The job can be done, but economic growth requires more than eliciting a temporary boost in investment and entrepreneurship.
It also requires effort to build four types of institutions required to maintain growth momentum and build resilience to shocks:
Market-creating institutions (for property rights and contract enforcement);
Market-regulating institutions (for externalities, economies of scale, and information about companies);
Market-stabilizing institutions (for monetary and fiscal management);
Market-legitimizing institutions (for social protection and insurance).
Building and solidifying these institutions, however, takes time.
Using an initial period of growth to experiment and innovate on these fronts can pay high dividends later on.
A key point here is that institutional arrangements are, by necessity, country-specific.
Discovering what works in any one country requires experimentation.
After all, institutions are not hot-house plants capable of being planted in any soil and climate.
Reforms that succeed in one setting may perform poorly or fail completely in others.
Such specificity helps explain why successful countries--China, India, South Korea, and Taiwan, among others--usually combined unorthodox elements with orthodox policies.
It also accounts for why important institutional differences persist among the advanced countries of North America, Western Europe, and Japan in areas such as the role of the public sector, the legal system, corporate governance, financial markets, labor markets, and social insurance.
While economic analysis can help in making institutional choices, there is also a large role for public deliberation and collective choice.
In fact, we can think of participatory democracy as a meta-institution that helps select among the "menu" of possible institutional arrangements in each area.
Designing such a growth strategy is both harder and easier than implementing standard neoliberal policies.
It is harder because the binding constraints on growth are usually country-specific and do not respond well to standardized recipes.
But it is easier because once those constraints are appropriately targeted, relatively simple policy changes can yield enormous economic payoffs and start a virtuous cycle of growth and institutional reform.
Adopting this approach does not mean abandoning mainstream economics--far from it.
Neoliberalism is to neoclassical economics as astrology is to astronomy.
In both cases, it takes a lot of blind faith to go from one to the other.
Critics of neoliberalism should not oppose mainstream economics--only its misuse.
The Other Central Europe
A specter is haunting Central Europe as its countries prepare for EU membership.
That promising development is being endangered by a fevered electoral nationalism which seeks to gain votes by promising to reopen old wounds and settle old scores.
The clearest case of this comes from Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban demanded an abrogation of President Edvard Benes' decrees of 1945 (which confiscated the assets of and stripped citizenship from the German and Hungarian populations deported from Czechoslovakia at that time) as part of a re-election campaign that failed narrowly.
But Orban is not alone in seeing electoral advantage in summoning the memories of old ghosts.
Orban argued that revoking the "Benes decrees" must be made a condition for the Czech Republic (as well as Slovakia) joining the European Union.
The ill will Orban's gambit inspired brought to a halt much of the regional cooperation of the last decade.
In its place, an ugly new form of national populism is emerging across the plain that extends between Bavaria and the Danube.
The chain reaction of reawakening nationalisms is altering the political landscape in dangerous ways.
Since the election that brought the coalition of Wolfgang Schüssel's and Jorg Haider's parties to power in Vienna, Austria's relations with the neighboring Czech Republic have deteriorated over two issues: a demand that the Czechs shutdown the Temelin nuclear power plant on the Austrian border, and revoke the Benes decrees in which Sudeten Germans were deported from Czechoslovakia and settled massively in Bavaria but also in Austria.
When the nuclear plant issue was resolved, populist pressure was forced into a single channel, the demand to abrogate the Benes decrees.
Czech Prime Minister Milos Zeman quickly demonstrated that he, too, could play a demagogic nationalist card.
He described the Sudeten Germans as Hitler's "Fifth Column" and suggested that Israel could solve its Palestinian problem through resort to the Czech method of 1945: deportation.
Edmund Stoiber, Bavaria's leader, the conservative CDU/CSU candidate for German chancellor against current Chancellor Schroeder, and a staunch advocate of the Sudeten Germans, demanded that Schroeder cancel a scheduled visit to Prague in response to Zeman's outburst.
To defuse an electoral fight with his rival, Schroeder agreed.
That Orban seconded Stoiber's demands came as something of a gift from god to the Slovak nationalist Vladimir Meciar in his bid to become Prime Minister once more, as it allowed him to argue that his domestic opponents were preparing to surrender to EU pressure and force Slovakia to compensate the Hungarians expelled by Benes in 1945.
So Meciar pounced, denouncing the "Hungarian menace," undoing in a stroke four years of hard work by Slovakia's current government to integrate representatives of the ethnic Hungarian minority into Slovakia's government.
Questions about postwar Europe's juridical order go beyond the former Czechoslovakia.
Erika Steinbach, President of the Association of Deportees (from the East) and a member of Stoiber's CDU, argues that the issue of the deportation of German populations is one faced by Poles, Czechs, Slovaks and Slovenes, thus taking in most of East/Central Europe.
In the 1930s, the pet hate of some Central European countries was "the Versailles Order."
Today, it appears that the Potsdam declarations of 1945, which sanctioned the mass eviction of German populations, are the new enemy.
The worry now is that such demagoguery may incite a cycle of populist victories.
That worry was dented when Viktor Orban's Fidesz party lost in Hungary's recent parliamentary elections, but other politicians happy to demagogue national resentments - Vaclav Klaus in Prague, Edmund Stoiber in Germany, Vladimir Meciar in Slovakia - still see nationalism as an electoral plus despite Orban's defeat.
Linked to EU skeptics like Italy's Berlusconi and Austria's Schüssel-Haider coalition, the very nature of European politics may turn decidedly nasty.
Since its inception, the EU has sought to reach beyond past grief and, through cooperation, to build a better future.
Today, some politicians want to capitalize on Eastern Europe's desire to be part of Europe to reopen historical issues to their political advantage.
Two savage consequences are foreseeable: first, that there is no better way to turn parts of public opinion in the candidate countries against the EU than by allowing local populists to portray the Union as an agent of spreading German power.
An extended EU should represent a means to balance the asymmetrical relationship between Eastern Europe's small countries with Germany.
There's a chance that it would be perceived as a pointer to this asymmetry.
The second worry is that, as NATO and the EU expand, these ugly debates will infect relations within these international bodies.
Fear about this may be one reason why President Bush refused to meet Prime Minister Orban recently, and there are frequent suggestions that, had Orban spoken as he now does before Hungary joined NATO, his country's application would have been rejected.
What can halt this?
After 1945, Western Europe undertook painful debates about history, and these helped bring about Franco-German reconciliation.
Notions about "collective guilt" were put aside as having no place in a united and uniting Europe.
So President Vaclav Havel courageously argued during his first trip to Germany in January 1990, but his comments were mistaken for weakness.
As EU expansion looms, Europe's mission must not become undermined by the advocates of that old and "other" Central Europe, politicians who prefer to wallow in the past rather than think in responsible ways about building a peaceful and prosperous Europe.
Consequences of the Iraq War
The Iraq war's main consequences will not be on the battlefield.
They will come later, and will depend on whether George Bush and Tony Blair can justify their onslaught on a largely defenseless population.
They launched this war for certain declared reasons, all of which were heatedly debated around the world.
If they are vindicated, then the war could conceivably bring a safer world.
If their arguments remain unproved or are disproved, then the war will incite instability.
In that case, a critical step towards healing the world would be their quick departure from office.
The Iraq War was not and could not be justified on the basis that Saddam Hussein was a tyrant.
Justification, if it exists, rests on the danger Saddam's regime posed.
Bush and Blair made four claims:
Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction;
those weapons pose a grave, immediate threat;
UN inspections were not eliminating that threat;
the threat could best be eliminated by war.
The first claim should be the easiest to verify.
Bush and Blair talked repeatedly about stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, massive underground and mobile units to produce or launch such weapons, and active programs to obtain nuclear weapons.
It is incumbent upon Bush and Blair to prove their case, and to prove it in the face of worldwide suspicion that the US and UK security agencies might plant phony evidence.
For this reason, independent UN experts should assess any evidence that is uncovered.
If no evidence of such weapons is produced, then both Bush and Blair deserve to be finished politically, no matter what else happens in Iraq.
The second claim will be trickier to prove.
Bush and Blair must show that any weapons of mass destruction that are recovered posed a grave and urgent threat.
We know that Iraq at one time possessed chemical and biological weapons, because the US sold them to Iraq.
The test is not whether traces of those weapons remain, as such traces will be found at disposal sites, but whether those weapons were poised for use in threatening amounts.
If the Iraqis launch an attack with such weapons, this would demonstrate that the weapons were ready for use.
Whether they posed any real threat outside Iraq's borders, or would have been used in the absence of the current war, must still be assessed.
The third claim is hugely contentious.
Bush and Blair should demonstrate that the UN inspection process was failing.
This can be done by showing that the Iraqis were simply hiding the evidence at sites visited by the inspectors and declared free of weapons.
There should be a systematic review of sites that were visited.
There should also be an explanation, if weapons of mass destruction are uncovered at other sites, as to why the inspectors could not have found such weapons in a realistic period of time.
The fourth claim will be subject to wild propaganda on both sides.
Was the war justified in terms of costs and benefits, and was war really the last resort?
This will depend on an objective assessment of the costs of the war in terms of loss of life, destruction of property, economic impact within Iraq, spillovers into other forms of violence such as terrorism, and geopolitical consequences.
To date, Bush and Blair have failed to make the case to the world, with the partial exception of their own countries.
The American people have been treated to a spectacle of jingoism, fear mongering, confusion of Iraq with Osama bin Laden's terrorists, and simple patriotism.
None of this swayed the rest of the world, which views the war with disdain and alarm.
This would change if evidence on the four points is mustered.
When the 13 British colonies in North America launched their own War of Independence, Thomas Jefferson understood that "the decent respect to the opinions of mankind" required an explanation for that war, which he set forth in the Declaration of Independence.
Such an explanation, backed by rigorous evidence, is no less necessary today.
If the arguments for war are not proved, the consequences will be profound.
Propaganda, streets lined with cheering Iraqis, amazement over the prowess of US smart bombs, would not distract us from an awful truth-that Bush and Blair shattered world peace, engaged in massive premeditated killing, and did so against overwhelming global opinion.
Healing today's divided world could start only with fresh political leadership in both the US and UK, and a strong assertion of UN authority.
Given the terrible costs, I hope that this war will prove justified, though I have my doubts based on the current evidence.
If compelling evidence proves that weapons of mass destruction were at hand; that they were poised for use on a threatening scale; that the UN inspectors had poor prospects of uncovering and dismantling those weapons, then we must acknowledge the arguments made by Bush and Blair.
Even in those circumstances, war might well have been unwise compared to a policy of containment.
Still, the war would then at least make some sense.
The horrors of a senseless war are almost too frightening to contemplate.
Remembering and Forgetting Zhao Ziyang
So, at last former Chinese Premier and Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang has died.
But the political agenda that he espoused while in office passed away long ago, on May 19, 1989, when he appeared in Tiananmen Square just before dawn to beg tearfully for the forgiveness of protesters.
"I am very sorry," he said to startled onlookers.
"I have come too late."
After that, he existed more as an historical chimera than as a real person.
When his bizarre and unscheduled appearance in the square was broadcast on Central Chinese Television the next morning -- during one of the last days of uncensored media coverage -- people across China were stunned by this fleeting moment of all-too-human, official anguish.
After all, Party leaders rarely evince their personal feelings in public, much less transgress the Party line as brazenly as Zhao did.
Such individualism fit neither Leninist nor traditional Chinese proscriptions for behavior by a high official.
As the crackdown following those heady weeks of free expression and assembly came to its apocalyptic end on the night of June 3-4, Zhao vanished, sucked down the Party's memory hole into which so many other leaders have vanished since China's "socialist liberation."
To the discredit of the democratic world, hardly any head of state remonstrated on Zhao's behalf, minimally demanding that some accounting be made for his illegal and immoral incarceration.
Instead, Zhao was allowed to remain in suspended animation, under house arrest, conveniently forgotten like some cryogenically frozen celebrity with no hope of resurrection.
Zhao was not killed, but allowed to live in an old Beijing courtyard house with his family.
He was let out from time to time, but under guard like a zoo animal, to go to some spa or to play solitary holes of golf, one of the many manifestations of "bourgeois liberalization" that his reform efforts allowed to leak through China's once hermetic seal.
Chinese have long since used the deaths of defrocked leaders as occasions to let out sentiments that can find no expression through the normal political process.
During the winter of 1976, when Premier Zhou Enlai (viewed as a relative liberal in the Maoist hierarchy) died, tens of thousands of people spontaneously flooded Tiananmen Square, giving the Party a tremendous fright.
It was, of course, the death of former Party chief Hu Yaobang, a liberal like Zhao, which set off the protests in 1989.
Whether Zhao's supporters will express themselves in a similar fashion is uncertain.
The events of 1989 remain so sensitive, and Tiananmen Square so securely guarded, that it is hard to imagine a protest happening there soon.
At the same time, China seems so drugged on business nowadays that it is hard to imagine many people marching for a cause that would do nothing for their bottom line.
It's almost as if the Communist Party had turned Marx on his head, replacing religion with profit as the new "opium of the masses."
Few outside of the lumpen classes of unemployed workers and dispossessed peasants seem to have any gusto for political protest.
By contrast, Zhao embodied a chapter in Chinese history when to be a reformer meant to take on not only the economy, but every aspect of life.
Before becoming Premier and Party chief, he experimented with everything from the de-collectivization of agriculture and separation of the Party from business to laws guaranteeing the rights of journalists and greater openness toward the outside world for ordinary people.
He was even the first Chinese leader to wear a suit and tie rather than a Mao habit when traveling abroad, as well as the first to hold an open press conference.
Although Zhao was no visionary, no Vaclav Havel or Lech Walesa, and not even anti-communist, his agenda in the mid-1980's embraced the economy, politics, culture, media, and society, and it led to one of the most open and intellectually rich periods of Chinese history.
It was a tragic paradox that the political movement that so peacefully swept China in 1989 ended up arresting the process of broad-based, evolutionary reform to which Zhao consecrated his life.
So chastened by the trauma of June 4 was the Party leadership that, for several years afterwards, it was unclear if any reform would survive.
Then, in 1992, Deng Xiaoping set in motion one of the most rapid and total marketizations of a society in history, catalyzing China's spectacular rise as an economic superpower.
Zhao Ziyang's death reminds us not only of how unjustly he was treated, but of how lopsided China's reforms have been.
For China's "miracle" to truly become miraculous, Party leaders could do worse than study the record of a man whose legacy they now seem eager to push into oblivion.
The Real Risks of Deficits
Deficits are back--with a vengeance.
America's government budget deficit now stands at $455 billion, 4.1% of GDP.
Two years ago, the US predicted budget surpluses as far as the eye could see.
Although marginally less bloated than the US deficit, other rich countries are drowning in red ink.
The European Commission predicts that the French government deficit will reach 3.7% of GDP this year, with Germany's widening to 3.4%--both figures well beyond the deficit cap (3% of GDP) set by the Euro-zone's Stability and Growth Pact.
By running a deficit, a country increases its national debt and imposes burdens on future generations.
Politicians naturally prefer to hide how wealth is shifted between generations.
Their priority is paying for immediate problems, and for today's promised benefits.
The accountants who compute government deficits try to keep politicians from fooling us into accepting the benefits they offer without understanding something of the future cost.
But what these accountants do not provide is a way to judge when deficits are justifiable and when they are not.
Deficits raise not only immediate political issues, but also issues of distributive justice between generations, and of intergenerational risk sharing.
No generation should be forced to accept unnecessary economic risks imposed by another generation.
Whether or not deficits treat future generations properly depends on how a government's systems for taxation and expenditure are designed.
Those who advocate running deficits often portray them as necessary to fix an economy in which confidence is draining away.
Following Keynes, they argue that running deficits will restore confidence before a recession or depression can take hold.
It is like putting a patient on Prozac before he becomes suicidal.
But such arguments, although valid at times, have their limits.
Japan's public deficits spawned a national debt of 140% of annual GDP, without producing any economic resurgence.
Indeed, today's budget deficits reflect long-term problems that are not what Keynesian theory envisions.
So discussions about deficits should be recast in terms of the really long-term intergenerational issues that matter.
The issues are subtle, because they hinge on what future governments may do.
In the past, some governments, when faced with large national debts, effectively ``inflated them away.''
They thus shifted the debt burden away from the next generation and onto investors who did not bail out of the bond market at the first sign of rising prices, or who postponed buying a house when inflation would have wiped out the real value of their mortgage debt.
Governments could decide to act this way again, especially if national debts grow bigger.
A resurgence of substantial inflation may seem unthinkable in today's environment, but remember that even a relatively modest 6% annual inflation rate cuts the real value of a nation's debt in half in just 11 years.
Continued public opposition to a gradual increase in inflation is not guaranteed.
Some future politicians may succeed again in planting the idea that inflation, being stimulative, is good for the economy.
But in addition to today's officially measured government deficits, there are also other looming obligations caused by a demographic change (declining birth rates) and the prospect of huge social-welfare payments in the future.
The scale of these obligations is monumental.
In their 2003 report, the Trustees of the US Social Security Administration Trust Funds estimate that maintaining the Social Security System's solvency for the next 75 years will require an amount whose present value is $3.5 trillion, nearly equal to today's total US government debt ($3.9 trillion).
The Trustees of the US Medicare Trust Funds (providing medical services to the retired) estimate that their unfunded obligations have a present value of $5.9 trillion--50% larger than America's official publicly-held national debt.
The potential for budgetary shortfall with social security and health care is even worse in Europe and Japan, due to their more troublesome demographics.
Moreover, unlike official national debt, social-welfare obligations are not fixed in currency.
Instead, they are promises of a certain standard of living (including the value of medical services), corrected for inflation.
No government can thus ``inflate them away.''
But this does not mean that pensions and other welfare obligations are entirely fixed.
What it does mean is that the problem is political.
Pensioners are among the most powerful lobbies in a democracy, and politicians are loath to confront them on so fundamental an issue.
Still, we need to face squarely the intergenerational issues at the core of today's economic dilemmas.
Our pension systems and our national budgets must be based on a ``generational accounting'' that assures that economic risk is spread systematically across generations.
What this means is that pension and tax institutions must be designed to take better account of the changing circumstances facing different generations, rather than make fixed promises--which most likely cannot be kept, anyway--of a certain payout in the future.
For example, when demographic trends or persistent economic hardships impose undue social-welfare burdens on working people, benefits to pensioners should be automatically modified by raising the retirement age and/or adjusting benefits.
Such adjustments will probably happen anyway in the coming decades, but only after a long lag and with many inequities in the process.
What we need is the right system from the beginning, so that we can rationally manage risks that span several generations.
Can these issues be addressed now, when the economic slowdown in most advanced countries makes most politicians focus on short-term fixes?
Hard times, like the Great Depression, have been occasions for fundamental changes.
With proper leadership (which unfortunately seems in short supply), today's milder hardships could provide an opportunity for public discussion of better ways of intergenerational risk sharing.
Just Say No to Bush
For three years, America's president has pursued a unilateralist agenda, ignoring all evidence that contradicts his positions, and putting aside basic and longstanding American principles.
Take global warming.
Here Bush is conspicuously absent without leave (AWOL in military jargon).
Time and again, he questions the scientific evidence.
(Of course, Bush's academic credentials were never very impressive.)
Bush's position is more than wrong; it is an embarrassment.
Indeed, when asked by Bush to look into the matter, America's National Academy of Sciences came to a resounding verdict (the only one they could honestly reach) that greenhouse gases are a menace.
But America's automakers love their gas-guzzlers, and Bush's oil industry pals want no interference with their destruction of the planet's atmosphere.
So no change in policy.
In Iraq, Bush again pursued a unilateralist agenda, saying that there was incontrovertible evidence of a link with Al Queda, and that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.
Even before the invasion, there was overwhelming evidence that Bush was lying.
Detection technology made it clear that Iraq did not have nuclear weapons, as chief UN inspector Hans Blix pointed out.
It's possible that Bush read those reports, but that they were beyond his comprehension.
It is also possible that he did not believe what he read.
Whatever the case, American policy was not based on evidence.
Since the Cold War's end, America is the world's sole superpower.
Yet it has failed to exercise the kind of leadership needed to create a new world order based on principles like fairness.
Europe and the rest of the world are aware of this; but they don't vote in American elections.
Even so, the rest of the world is not powerless.
Instead, the rest of the world should
America has not won the hearts and minds of those in Iraq; indeed, it has lost them, just as it has lost the hearts and minds of much of the world.
The US wants to retain control of the occupation, but it wants others to receive the bullets now mowing down American soldiers.
UN soldiers should not bear the consequence of America's failure to manage the occupation, so US cries for financial help should fall on deaf ears.
What sympathy does the US agenda deserve, when President Bush has ladled out tax cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars to the richest people in the world.
It was not long ago that a Republican Congress held up $1 billion of UN dues, and threatened that it would only pay what it owed if the UN satisfied a raft of conditions.
America's unwillingness to provide small sums to wage peace contrasts sharply with the huge amounts Congress quickly granted to wage war.
Advocates of a softer approach say that if the UN stays on the sidelines, it will become irrelevant; by participating in Iraq, it will build trust with America, so that the next time a dispute such as this arises, America will turn earlier to the UN.
Nonsense.
Those in the White House today believe in
I normally write about economics, not politics.
But in the new world of globalization, there is greater economic interdependence, which requires more collective action, rules and institutions, and an international rule of law.
Economic globalization has, however, outpaced political globalization; the processes for decision making are far from democratic, or even transparent.
In no small measure, the failures of globalization can be traced to the same mindset that led to the failures in Iraq: multilateral institutions must serve not just one country's interest, but all countries'.
At the recent World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting in Cancun, the developing countries put America--and Europe--on notice that this system can no longer continue.
In that case, Europe was as much the culprit as America.
Europe has no trouble seeing the dangers of unilateralism in America's actions, in everything from abandoning Kyoto to its refusal to join the International Criminal Court.
But Europe should also reflect on its own practices, including trade policy, where the EU works systematically to unbalance the global trade regime against developing countries, despite promising that those imbalances would be corrected in the current round of trade negotiations.
Here, Europe acts like America, which has long talked the rhetoric of free trade, while its actions have long ignored the principles.
Forget about America's rhetoric of upholding fairness and justice; in trade negotiations, the US ignores the pleas of the poorest countries of the world to eliminate the cotton subsidies that have had so devastating an effect on them.
If we are to make the world politically more secure and economically more stable and prosperous, political globalization will have to catch up with economic globalization.
Principles of democracy, social justice, social solidarity, and the rule of law need to be extended beyond national boundaries.
Europe and the rest of the world will have to do their part--abiding by these principles themselves, and giving each other, and America, a shove in the right direction.
Right now, this entails `Just Saying No' to President Bush.
The True Costs of the Iraq War
The most important things in life ­ like life itself ­ are priceless.
But that doesn't mean that issues involving the preservation of life (or a way of life), like defense, should not be subjected to cool, hard economic analysis.
Shortly before the current Iraq war, when Bush administration economist Larry Lindsey suggested that the costs might range between $100 and $200 billion, other officials quickly demurred.
For example, Office of Management and Budget Director Mitch Daniels put the number at $60 billion.
It now appears that Lindsey's numbers were a gross underestimate.
Concerned that the Bush administration might be misleading everyone about the Iraq war's costs, just as it had about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and connection with Al Qaida, I teamed up with Linda Bilmes, a budget expert at Harvard, to examine the issue.
Even we, as opponents of the war, were staggered by what we found, with conservative to moderate estimates ranging from slightly less than a trillion dollars to more than $2 trillion.
Our analysis starts with the $500 billion that the Congressional Budget Office openly talks about, which is still ten times higher than what the administration said the war would cost.
Its estimate falls so far short because the reported numbers do not even include the full budgetary costs to the government.
And the budgetary costs are but a fraction of the costs to the economy as a whole.
For example, the Bush administration has been doing everything it can to hide the huge number of returning veterans who are severely wounded -- 16,000 so far, including roughly 20% with serious brain and head injuries.
So it is no surprise that its figure of $500 billion ignores the lifetime disability and healthcare costs that the government will have to pay for years to come.
Nor does the administration want to face up to the military's recruiting and retention problems.
The result is large re-enlistment bonuses, improved benefits, and higher recruiting costs -- up 20% just from 2003 to 2005.
Moreover, the war is extremely wearing on equipment, some of which will have to be replaced.
These budgetary costs (exclusive of interest) amount to $652 billion in our conservative estimate and $799 billion in our moderate estimate.
Arguably, since the government has not reined in other expenditures or increased taxes, the expenditures have been debt financed, and the interest costs on this debt add another $98 billion (conservative) to $385 billion (moderate) to the budgetary costs.
Of course, the brunt of the costs of injury and death is borne by soldiers and their families.
But the military pays disability benefits that are markedly lower than the value of lost earnings.
Similarly, payments for those who are killed amount to only $500,000, which is far less than standard estimates of the lifetime economic cost of a death, sometimes referred to as the statistical value of a life ($6.1 to $6.5 million).
But the costs don't stop there.
The Bush administration once claimed that the Iraq war would be good for the economy, with one spokesperson even suggesting that it was the best way to ensure low oil prices.
As in so many other ways, things have turned out differently: the oil companies are the big winners, while the American and global economies are losers.
Being extremely conservative, we estimate the overall effect on the economy if only $5 or $10 of the increase is attributed to the war.
At the same time, money spent on the war could have been spent elsewhere.
We estimate that if a proportion of that money had been allocated to domestic investment in roads, schools, and research, the American economy would have been stimulated more in the short run, and its growth would have been enhanced in the long run.
There are a number of other costs, some potentially quite large, although quantifying them is problematic.
For instance, Americans pay some $300 billion annually for the "option value" of military preparedness -- being able to fight wherever needed.
That Americans are willing to pay this suggests that the option value exceeds the costs.
But there is little doubt that the option value has been greatly impaired and will likely remain so for several years.
In short, even our "moderate" estimate may significantly underestimate the cost of America's involvement in Iraq.
And our estimate does not include any of the costs implied by the enormous loss of life and property in Iraq itself.
We do not attempt to explain whether the American people were deliberately misled regarding the war's costs, or whether the Bush administration's gross underestimate should be attributed to incompetence, as it vehemently argues is true in the case of weapons of mass destruction.
Nor do we attempt to assess whether there were more cost-effective ways of waging the war.
Recent evidence that deaths and injuries would have been greatly reduced had better body armor been provided to troops suggests how short-run frugality can lead to long-run costs.
Certainly, when a war's timing is a matter of choice, as in this case, inadequate preparation is even less justifiable.
But such considerations appear to be beyond the Bush administration's reckoning.
Elaborate cost-benefit analyses of major projects have been standard practice in the defense department and elsewhere in government for almost a half-century.
The Iraq war was an immense "project," yet it now appears that the analysis of its benefits was greatly flawed and that of its costs virtually absent.
One cannot help but wonder: were there alternative ways of spending a fraction of the war's $1-$2 trillion in costs that would have better strengthened security, boosted prosperity, and promoted democracy?
Is Freedom Enough?
Do democracies need values?
The question seems absurd in the light of photographs of American soldiers torturing and humiliating Iraqi prisoners.
But the fact is that the advance of democracy historically entailed the erosion of shared values and the rise of individual autonomy.
It presupposed moral agnosticism and a plurality of meanings, none of which are sacred or compulsory to all.
Democracy does nurture some common values, but they are overwhelmingly liberal values - in other words, individual rights trump collective obligations.
For contemporary democrats, the fullest possible respect for the autonomous individual is, as Thomas Jefferson put it, "self-evident."
But are civil, political, and human rights enough to ensure the strength and survival of democracies?
Are today's democracies virtuous enough to rally the energies - including self-sacrifice - needed to defeat their enemies?
Such questions were never so urgent in the past, partly because fundamental democratic values were less abstract than they seem nowadays.
Such values animated the fight against Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism, fascism, and military dictatorship; in their name, decolonization was achieved, and minorities gained equality and dignity.
Democracy's values may be one-sided on behalf of individual rights, but this has also made them universal, legitimizing the struggle against oppression, wherever it is played out.
But in the world's most advanced countries, the promise of material prosperity that freedom made possible has long since replaced attention to and defense of fundamental democratic values as the cement of society.
Western citizens do not rush to emulate the freedom fighters who built their world, despite celebrations, memorials, and the persistence of oppression.
The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States allegedly changed everything - not only international relations, but the balance between rights and obligations that we long took for granted.
In fact, the attacks, while surprising in their method, symbolic character, and scope, changed nothing.
By themselves, they merely revealed the urgency of a fundamental reappraisal that has long been necessary.
What is the Western model of democratic development really worth?
Some non-democratic systems seem to evoke deeper support, because they are based on religious or national communal solidarity, and because closed societies minimize doubt, drift, and criticism.
Beyond fundamental freedoms and economic prosperity, do we have a specific civilization to defend?
Ours is a civilization that accepts selfishness towards one's own family and group; that tolerates, with few exceptions, autonomy in moral matters; and that considers blasphemy, criticism of authority, and even civil disobedience fundamental freedoms.
Our civilization, despite its drugs, prostitution, alcoholism, incivility, and vandalism, will always be better than rule by Mullahs or soldiers, because its social problems can be allayed, if never entirely eliminated, without changing the foundations of the regime.
This is not true of totalitarian or fundamentalist regimes, because, to foster free societies, they must be deposed.
But if our civilization is worth defending, why is it that fundamentalists, of whatever stripe, have the most committed fighters on their side?
Can we oppose them with anything but individual rights?
Two opposite temptations must be resisted.
The first temptation, characteristic of frightened societies, is a rush to embrace so-called "traditional" values, with their implications of withdrawal, closure, intolerance, and even hatred.
The second temptation is a purely military policy that fixates on physical strength without considering how to project greater credibility and fairness.
Of course, when enemies are already attacking, one cannot afford to ask too many questions.
But when enemies are merely threatening, it is better first to assert legitimacy, and thus acquire some credibility at home and abroad.
To do so, there cannot be too wide a gap between our stated principles and our actual behavior.
Nor can we claim, as we used to, that our values spring from God, nature, reason, or historical laws.
Our values reflect the democratic debate itself, nothing more, and our defense of them must address three related fields.
First, we must update our social contract.
France's ongoing public debate about secularism and legislation is an important effort in this direction, even if the debate could be better organized to demonstrate the link between principles, social and anthropological facts, and public policy.
Such a debate should also involve education - its rules, objectives, and contents.
In many countries, however, political parties find it difficult even to contemplate such debates.
The second axis of values concerns social justice and the environment.
Issues linked to inequality, the distribution of wealth, and our exploitation of the natural world will become increasingly salient.
This debate has not happened in the US, despite vague attempts at the beginning of the first Clinton administration; it has barely begun with Tony Blair's "Third Way" in the UK, or with Gerhard Schröder's variant in Germany.
In France, the debate has stalled altogether due to bitter distributive conflicts, deep division within the Left, and the Right's absence of an economic and social vision.
What remains are the values linked to the global order, defense of which requires leading by example, not by narrow, legalistic initiatives aimed at crisis management or conflict resolution.
This approach too often sacrifices long-term essential objectives to short-term concerns.
The fight for democracy cannot be selective.
A desirable vision for the future of humanity must appeal to universally shared conceptions of justice and equity.
We must all become freedom fighters.
Elections Are Venezuela's Last Chance
Venezuela is mired in a dangerous stalemate.
President Hugo Chávez clings to power despite the obvious failings of his government: severe economic deterioration and dangerous political polarization.
The opposition, tainted by their botched coup of April 2002, now seeks to force Chávez from office through a costly general strike.
Both sides justify their intransigence with one-sided interpretations.
His sympathizers glorify Chávez as a defender of the poor besieged by a selfish, coup-plotting elite.
His fiercest opponents demonize Chávez as an autocrat pursuing a Cuban-style revolution and destroying democracy.
Both interpretations are flawed.
The Chávez government has not helped Venezuela's poor in any significant way.
On the contrary, his belligerent rhetoric and inept governance scared off investors, inciting economic decline and boosting unemployment and poverty.
Now Chávez lacks majority backing even among the poor.
The opposition comprises most of Venezuela's organized civil society, not only business, but also trade unions, professional associations, and NGOs.
So Venezuela's polarization does not pit "the poor" against "the oligarchy," but a populist against civil society.
The opposition's view--shared by rightists in the Bush administration--is equally unconvincing.
Rather than initiating a revolution, Chávez merely spouts fiery rhetoric.
While his democratic credentials are dubious, he has not
But Chávez's insistence on the inviolability of the current constitution is hypocritical.
Four years ago, Chávez deviated from the old constitution by using a plebiscite to engineer a new one, tailor-made for him.
Now he invokes that charter to block calls for a plebiscite on his continuation in office.
The paradox here is that Chávez's earlier example may provide the solution to today's standoff.
As Chávez used para-constitutional means to advance a desire for change in 1999, so the international community should not be confined by the present constitution in pressing to resolve a crisis that is ruining the country.
In fact, the Latin American members of the "group of friendly nations" trying to mediate this conflict can draw on interesting experiences to design such a solution.
After all, confrontations like this are not unusual in Latin America's rigid presidential systems.
When chief executives with fixed terms of office lose political support, they cannot be removed through a no-confidence vote, as in parliamentary systems.
Presidential systems therefore risk lengthy stand-offs that threaten democracy--as in Venezuela today.
But over the last decade, Latin American politicians have made presidential systems more flexible by finding innovative ways to remove unpopular presidents.
One of Chávez's discredited predecessors was impeached on flimsy charges of malfeasance; Ecuador's Congress declared a disastrous chief executive "mentally incompetent"; in Peru, an autocratic president, after months of domestic and international pressure, was forced into exile.
While politicians interpreted the law with a good deal of creativity in these instances, they usually did so to ensure the survival of fragile democracies facing a crisis.
As long as these maneuvers do not proliferate and turn into easy ammunition for the opposition of the moment, they may provide a safety valve for presidential systems.
International monitoring can also safeguard against frivolous use of such mechanisms.
It is to be hoped that the group of friendly nations can help design an innovative solution to Venezuela's standoff.
To be acceptable to both sides, such a solution must deviate from the favorite proposals of each.
The opposition prefers an "up-or-down" vote on Chávez's continuation in office, which it would most likely win--and which Chávez will never accept.
Chávez insists on the recall referendum mechanism included in his constitution, which the opposition cannot tolerate: removing the president in this way would require a larger absolute number of votes than Chávez garnered in the last election.
But rising abstention makes this virtually impossible.
Both proposals are thus politically unfeasible.
Only a democratic mechanism for conflict resolution that has an uncertain outcome has any chance of being adopted.
That mechanism is an election, to be held as soon as possible (realistically, by this summer).
Both sides will have to work hard if they want to win.
The fractious opposition will need to go beyond rejection of Chávez, elaborate a program for the country's reconstruction, and unite behind an attractive candidate.
President Chávez will need to clarify the content and meaning of his "Bolivarian Revolution."
Since Chávez is a skilled campaigner and the opposition so far lacks unity, he will have a realistic chance of winning--which should make a new contest acceptable to him.
Pressure from the group of friendly nations may induce both sides to accept this last chance to avoid a political and economic meltdown.
Elections can be made legitimate through a constitutional amendment shortening the presidential term, as proposed by Jimmy Carter in his recent mediation effort.
Since this is designed to defuse an exceptional crisis, it would not become a precedent that encourages frivolous attacks on Latin America's democratically elected governments.
An election now in Venezuela will save, not undermine, democracy.
Syria's Dangerous Liaisons
All eyes turned to Syria following the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
Opposition groups in Lebanon, as well as Hariri supporters, openly accused Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime of being responsible for the killing.
The Bush administration, while not formally blaming Syria, virtually did so and recalled its ambassador to Damascus.
The US is said to be extremely angry at Syria's refusal to withdraw its forces from Lebanon in line with a United Nations resolution.
Growing opposition to Syrian hegemony in Lebanon is but one of four related problems Syria faces, all of which it has addressed inadequately.
The other three are Syria's behavior in Iraq, its relations with the US, and the need for domestic reform.
While corrosive immobility is a trademark of the Syrian regime, these challenges threaten to reinforce each other and marginalize Syria internationally even more so than today.
In Lebanon, the Syrians have repeatedly misread the Bush administration's intentions.
Last September, the US, together with France, sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 1559 demanding a Syrian pullout and the disarming of militias -- mainly Hezbollah.
This came after Assad last September imposed an unconstitutional extension of Lebanese President Emile Lahoud's mandate, despite French and American warnings.
Yet to this day, Syrian officials privately say that they don't think the US is serious about a withdrawal.
Syria's leaders also continue to dismiss demands from within Lebanon for an end to Syria's 28-year military presence.
Such demands escalated dramatically after Hariri's death, as tens of thousands of the former prime minister's partisans, who previously sat on the fence when it came to Syria, shouted "Syria out."
Indeed, a broad multi-communal opposition front has formed in Beirut to demand Syria's departure.
Yet rather than address the front's demands and shape a healthy bilateral relationship between equal countries, Syria has sought to divide the opposition and reassert control.
Hariri's assassination makes that far more difficult, and Syria must prepare for a strong backlash from the US and France.
In Iraq, since the fall of Baghdad on April 9, 2003, Damascus has shown undue nostalgia for the old system.
Though the Syrian and Iraqi Baath parties were bitter foes, there was consolation in that both were members of a confederacy of despotisms.
For the Syrians, a democratic Iraq friendly to the US was always far worse than Saddam Hussein, the enemy they knew -- and later profitably traded with -- during the years of international sanctions against Iraq.
Syria's suspected support for Iraqi Baathist exiles threatens to damage relations with the new Iraq.
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the Assad regime of allowing Iraqi funds to be channeled to insurgents, and recently notified the Syrians that the photograph of a senior Syrian intelligence official taken with an Islamist combatant was found on the latter's body in Falluja.
As a legitimate Iraqi authority emerges following the elections, the Syrians will have to show foresight in jettisoning their pro-Saddam acquaintances.
The Bush administration's growing impatience with Syrian involvement in the Iraqi insurgency is a major reason for Syria's deteriorating relationship with the US.
Indeed, there is palpable disdain for Syria in Washington.
That is why Syria's denials that it is playing a spoiler role in Iraq are rarely taken seriously, and why Assad has not gained American support for renewed negotiations with Israel over the Golan Heights.
There are signs that the Syrians are unable to gauge American intentions on other issues as well.
For example, Assad apparently still does not realize how much the Bush administration associates his regime with terrorism.
Syrian officials believe that because the Baath Party is secular, the US will invariably support it against an Islamist resurgence.
They fail to see that American officials regard Syria as complicit in the activities of Islamist terrorist groups in the Palestinian territories, Iraq, and Lebanon.
At home, Assad's regime also finds itself in a bind.
Political and economic reform, when it advances, does so at a glacial pace.
A major item of discussion in Syria is the revival of Islam as an alternative to a political and economic system offering few incentives except to regime grandees.
France's opposition to Syria's presence in Lebanon was at least partly a reflection of disenchantment with Assad's reformist ambitions, and the European Union has expressed similar reservations.
Assad is now in a consolidation phase, leaving little room for reform.
Indeed, his new interior minister, Ghazi Kanaan, an old-school hardliner, spearheaded a crackdown on reformers and Kurds in the past year or so.
The reshuffle last November that brought Kanaan and others into the cabinet was seen to reflect Assad's preferences.
In the coming month, several rounds of retirements should allow the president to place more of his people in positions of power.
Consolidation, however, is not reform.
Assad must show that his enhanced authority can lead to genuine transformation.
Until now, the president has toed a hard line on Iraq, on Lebanon, and in domestic affairs.
If he's a reformer, few are convinced.
Syria may pay a heavy price for that ambiguity.
Europe's Divided Racial House
A common feature of Europe's extreme right is its racism and use of the immigration issue as a political wedge.
The Lega Nord in Italy, the Vlaams Blok in the Netherlands, the supporters of Le Pen's National Front in France, are all examples of parties or movements formed on the common theme of aversion to immigrants and promotion of simplistic policies to control them.
While individuals like Jorg Haidar and Jean-Marie Le Pen may come and (never to soon) go, the race question will not disappear from European politics anytime soon.
An aging population at home and ever more open borders imply increasing racial fragmentation in European countries.
Mainstream parties of the center left and center right have confronted this prospect by hiding their heads in the ground, hoping against hope that the problem will disappear.
It will not, as America's racial history clearly shows.
Race relations in the US have been for decades - and remain - at the center of political debate, to the point that racial cleavages are as important as income, if not more, as determinants of political preferences and attitudes.
The first step to address racial politics is to understand the origin and consequences of racial animosity, even if it means uncovering unpleasant truths.
This is precisely what a large amount of research in economics, sociology, psychology and political science has done for the US.
This research shows that people of different races trust each other much less; whites are less willing to support welfare spending because it is perceived to favor minorities; more racially fragmented communities have less efficient governments, more corruption and patronage, more crime and fewer productive public goods per tax dollar.
This does not mean that the answer is to eliminate heterogeneity and create racially homogenous communities, but an acknowledgment of the reality of these issues is needed in order to start constructing solid public policies toward race relations.
Of course, Americans disagree on how to do this.
Some favor affirmative action programs that provide preferences for minorities in job allocation, college admission, and public contracts.
These policies are seen as a way of offering reparation for past injustices and, more importantly, for creating role models and for overcoming residual and perhaps involuntary discrimination.
Others object to affirmative action, and argue that a race-blind policy coupled with free market polices and pro-family values are all that are necessary to create jobs for minorities and help keep black families together.
The latter is a crucial in any policy, since one of the single most important causes of poverty in the US is the diffusion of single parents (read single mother) households in the black community.
Regardless of the correct answer, the point is that determining what to do about race is a dominant issue in US politics.
Of course, minorities have made progress towards more integration and economic success.
In the 1950s blacks could not sit in the front of busses, today two of the main players in US foreign politics are blacks.
To be sure, right wing American politicians continue deploy the "race card" as a tactical tool.
Take the case of Patrick Buchanan the former Nixon and Reagan aid who became an independent presidential candidate in the last election.
He recently published a successful book entitled" The Death of the West: How Dying Populations and Immigrant Invasion Imperil Our Country and Civilization."
But for every book like this there are ten others with a serious analysis of America's race question.
Policy analysis and debates about race relations lag terribly behind in Europe.
At most the question is dealt with narrowly, in terms of immigration quotas and border restrictions, not in terms of the social problems and opportunities created by an increasingly racially mixed Europe.
Of course, a clear immigration policy is needed in order to avoid the accumulation of illegal immigrants.
But this cannot be the end of it: border controls with Mexico are not the end of American policy towards domestic race issues!
Europe is rich and rapidly aging; Europeans, cushioned by generous welfare programs, are no longer prepared to accept "dirty jobs" in, say, agriculture or the leather industry.
This makes an increase in immigration unavoidable.
Europeans, however, are prompt to criticize the US for any failure in their policy toward minorities and for any manifestation of racism across the Atlantic.
Reading the European press one often perceives a superiority complex towards the US over racial issues: they, the Americans, have problems with racism; we are immune from it, except for crazed neo-Nazi skinheads and their like.
What has happened in recent weeks, from Paris to Amsterdam, shows that the race problem in Europe is much deeper and, as in the US, stems from the sad truth that race relations are inherently difficult and trust and cooperative behavior does not travel well across racial lines.
If Europe's mainstream parties do not begin a more serious investment in understanding racial tensions in Europe and put "race" as one of their main priorities, individuals like Le Pen are bound to try filling the void with their message of hate.
Fighting the French Exception
Europe's attention nowadays is rightly focused on enlargement and on the constitution that is currently being worked out between the EU's member states.
But the outcome of several Gallic skirmishes with the European Commission will be no less important in determining the fate of the new and enlarged Europe.
France has unilaterally chosen to ignore the Stability and Growth Pact by running a predicted deficit well above the 3% of GDP limit.
The French like to acclaim the rational rigour of their thinking, but where budgets are concerned, Descartes is out and obfuscation is in.
France was among the leading critics of Ireland, when, in 2000, the Irish government reduced its budget surplus, which then stood at 4% of GDP, by a mere 0.5%.
Other countries have violated the Stability Pact, but France is the first to do it with smirking, open defiance.
None of this should surprise anyone.
France is simply applying to EU rules its engrained habit of viewing its own culture as exceptional.
For example, France consistently vetoes reforms of the EU Common Agricultural Policy.
As even children know, the CAP is a handsome and totally undeserved present to wealthy European (especially French) farmers at the expense of the struggling farmers of developing countries and EU consumers.
France is also trying to return to old policies of bailing out unprofitable private companies on the verge of collapse with taxpayers' money.
The EU Commissioner for Competition Policy, Mario Monti, cannot loose this battle: he needs the support of those who believe in markets and equal treatment for all.
Here the story is simple.
The French government plans to bail out Alstom, a company that developed a number of high-tech products, including the TGV, the French fast train, but recently went into bankruptcy.
The French government claims that it will never back down from its plan to rescue Alstom, a plan with all the familiar dirigiste motivations: maintaining employment, protecting investors, etc.
In addition, since Alstom is a high tech firm, the French government plays the research and development card, arguing that investment in R&D is good for growth.
Saving Alstom by nationalizing the company is obviously wrong.
The company consists of many different parts, some profitable, others bankrupt: the obvious thing to do is to break it up.
The profitable parts, such as the TGV, will easily find buyers; the unprofitable plants should be closed.
French taxpayers' money is better spent on temporary benefits for displaced workers than on subsidies to keep an unprofitable plant alive.
It is important that the European Commission not allow France to carve out special rules for itself in competition policy, as it appears to be doing with its budget deficits.
The Commission must strike down public aid to private companies in France as it strikes such subsidies down in any other EU member state.
The Commission has already achieved some success on this front, notably forcing Germany to cancel government guarantees on public banks.
Alstom in particular and France in general should not be an exception and should be held to the same standards.
If the Commission fails to act, the EU will look even more like a playground for French public servants.
France has already taken a leading role in EU foreign policy, with Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin looking and acting more and more like the foreign minister of Europe.
At the same time France violates key rules of common economic policy and public aid to private companies.
Will the European Commission lose what remains of its credibility and end up looking like a minor Parisian arrondissment ?
A defeat on Alstom would have profound consequences in Europe--and not only for competition policy.
The War for Oil
For decades, through Democratic and Republican presidential administrations, America has pursued a set of straightforward energy policy objectives: keep world oil prices as stable as possible; reduce domestic consumption of oil as painlessly as possible; reduce dependence on foreign imports whenever possible; and diversify the sources of imported oil.
Despite appearances, none of these objectives has changed under the Bush administration.
Many observers believe that Bush has set a new course because the invasion of Iraq seems to fly in the face of these objectives.
A big increase in Iraq's oil production would probably increase US dependence on oil relative to other energy sources, as world oil prices will probably fall in response to the additional supplies.
This, in turn, would mean an increase in US dependence on imported oil, especially from the Middle East.
The irony, however, is that the US exercised greater control over the Iraqi oil sector under the UN's pre-war "Oil-for-Food Program" (in which the UN, not Saddam Hussein, determined the level of Iraqi oil sales abroad) than it will in any future democratic Iraq.
If the Bush administration was seeking stable, secure, diverse and cheap oil supplies, it could have simply lifted the embargos on Libya, Iran, Iraq, and Sudan and let the oil gush.
But America's interest in Iraqi oil was not driven either by economics or energy policy.
The Bush administration recognized that, above all, Iraqi oil is a critical geopolitical asset.
Whoever controls Iraqi oil controls Iraq.
Saddam's power came from his control of the world's second largest oil reserve.
He understood perfectly the role that oil played in his power.
Faced with the possibility of invasion and defeat, Saddam threatened to burn Iraq's oil fields.
Much of the subsequent destruction and looting of Iraqi oil facilities and pipelines reflects the widespread realization that control of oil means control of Iraq.
As the US planned its invasion, securing the oil fields became a critical priority.
The goal was not increased supplies or reduced prices for Americans, but stripping Saddam of his power and, ultimately, establishing and solidifying a new Iraqi government.
Iraq's future depends directly on the fate of Iraqi oil production.
Yet the vagaries of the oil business, particularly in such unsettled conditions, make it hard to see how the Bush administration will be able to achieve its goals in Iraq within the next few years.
The logic is simple.
The US must use oil revenues to lift the burden of financing regime change in Iraq from American taxpayers.
All reconstruction plans depend in the long run on the ability of Iraq to export oil in large quantities.
If Iraq does not deliver its oil, President Bush cannot deliver on his promises to the Iraqi people, the American people, or the world community.
Before the invasion, Iraq's oil production capacity reached three million barrels per day.
Iraq will not be able to increase its production to that level within the time frame needed to establish an Iraqi government.
Any increase in Iraqi oil production requires developing the oil fields, which means big investments, a legal and representative government, and political stability.
Not even the Bush administration expects these requirements to be met soon.
Indeed, political stability is the main condition for increasing production capacity.
Historical evidence from Iran, Kuwait, Russia, and even Iraq itself, indicates that it takes about three years from the re-establishment of political stability for capacity to increase significantly and for those new higher levels to be sustained.
Iraq needs several years to write a new constitution, establish a legitimate and democratic government, negotiate the distribution of oil revenues among its various regions, enact new investment laws, and make the economy attractive to foreigners.
It also needs time to negotiate with the international oil companies and neighboring countries, to perform technical and feasibility studies, and to reconstruct, rehabilitate, and explore its oil fields.
So even a three-year time frame seems optimistic, for it assumes that within that period, the occupation will end, Iraqis will establish their own democratic government, and that political stability will be achieved.
Needless to say, the situation may play out differently.
Tensions may remain high for years.
No one should be surprised, moreover, if Iraqi oil production suddenly stops altogether even under a democratic government.
History suggests that labor strikes and similar disruptions that can halt oil production are a greater threat in democratic than in undemocratic countries.
If Iraq cannot quickly increase its production capacity in the next few years, this will hinder both US foreign and energy policies.
How will the US finance the long-term reconstruction of Iraq?
Who will pay to maintain a fragile Iraqi democracy?
Can the US sustain its occupation if it cannot provide food, health care, and other basic services to Iraq's people?
These are tough questions, and they are fundamentally unanswerable until a stable, democratic regime in Iraq can control and ensure a steady flow of oil exports.
Letting Killers Guard Human Rights
If it were not so profoundly sad, it would qualify as the sick joke of the millennium: Libya has been elected to chair the United Nations Commission on Human Rights!
When Caligula appointed his horse to the Senate, the horse at least did not have blood on its hoofs.
The procedure, of course, was perfectly legal: the chairmanship rotates every year from one global region to another.
This year it was Africa's turn to nominate the chairman, and they nominated Libya.
Only the US and Canada voted against.
To their everlasting shame, European countries abstained.
It is a telling commentary on the moral bankruptcy of the UN that this decision comes at so delicate a time for the organization.
President Bush has challenged the UN to show its seriousness about its own mandatory decisions about Iraq: otherwise it may meet the same ignominious end as the League of Nations, which proved impotent in the 1930's when confronted with the aggressive policies of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy.
To have Libya elected at this moment to chair the UN body responsible for human rights hardly helps support either the legitimacy or the moral authority of the world body.
Let us remember: Libya is a totalitarian tyranny; its leader, Muammar Ghaddafi, combines sometimes erratic behavior with extremist policies, supporting dictators all over the world.
He heads one of the world's most oppressive regimes, where there is no pretense at elections and where dissent is instantly crushed.
Under his rule, Libya has supported terrorist organizations worldwide--from the IRA to various Palestinian extremist groups.
It remains under UN sanctions for its role in the downing of a Pan Am passenger flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, a decade ago.
In the last decade, the position of the UN as a symbol of the ideals of a peaceful world community has been steadily eroded.
It proved utterly unable to stop the wars in the Balkans; and in at least one case--Srebrenica--a Dutch UN peacekeeping force stood by and witnessed the worst massacre in post-1945 Europe, as Bosnian Serbs murdered around 6,000 defenseless Muslim men.
A Dutch commission of enquiry later admitted that the UN Dutch battalion was, in fact, complicit in that war crime.
In Rwanda, once the genocide started, the UN official responsible for peacekeeping operations ordered the evacuation of UN forces from the country, leaving the field wide open to the bloodiest genocidal massacre since World War II.
That UN official's name is Kofi Annan.
It is a depressing, pathetic record, which the UN is trying--probably in vain--to redeem by appearing, in the Iraq crisis, as the voice of reason and international legitimacy.
But at a time when UN inspections in Iraq seem like sending the Salvation Army to clear out a band of gangsters, raising Libya to head the Human Rights Commission may go down in history as the definitive failure of an organization whose life started with so much hope.
Organizations usually don't die--and certainly there is too much raison d'etat to make certain that the UN will continue to hobble on.
But it will be a mere shadow of what it should, and could, be.
Today's UN gives hypocrisy a bad name.
Authoritarians at the Gate
Last Thursday, judges at Indonesia's Central Jakarta Court sentenced me to one year in prison.
As the editor-in-chief of Tempo Weekly Newsmagazine , I am guilty, according to the court, of defaming a business tycoon named Tomy Winata by implying his possible involvement in a fire at Jakarta's South-East Asia textile market, and of fomenting riots by disseminating lies.
Does my case, and others like it, portend the end of yet another short-lived experiment with democracy in Indonesia?
The "riot" that I allegedly fomented occurred in March last year, when almost two hundred thugs claiming to be Winata's followers attacked Tempo's office, threatened to burn down the building, harassed staff, and injured one reporter.
Trying to help resolve the situation peacefully, I was persuaded to negotiate at the Central Jakarta Police Station, but found to my horror that the mob leaders controlled the station.
I was punched and kicked as the police looked the other way.
Fortunately, many journalists came to our rescue with tape recorders and cameras rolling.
Their broadcasts caused a public outcry, which forced our parliament to organize a public hearing.
The National and Jakarta police chiefs were called and, under massive public pressure, the leaders of the mob were criminally charged.
But Winata himself eluded police investigation, merely by claiming publicly that his followers acted without his prior knowledge and consent.
He then filed criminal charges of his own, against Ahmad Taufik, who wrote the article, Teuku Iskandar Ali, who edited it, and me.
The yearlong court proceedings were marked by a series of suspicious developments, all favoring Winata.
First, the case built by the police and state prosecutor contained documents that were so blatantly falsified that the police indicted two officers.
But the court rejected our request that proceedings be delayed until the legality of the state's case could be clarified.
The case against the officers involved appears to be going nowhere.
On the contrary, one of them has been promoted to command the newly formed (and US-funded) Jakarta Anti-Terror Unit.
The other has reportedly been sent to the police staff school for advanced training.
Then, in the sixth month of the case, the Head Judge in the three-judge panel was suddenly promoted to become the head of a city court an hour from Jakarta.
One of my lawyers noted that in his 35 years experience at the court, he had never seen a Head Judge replaced in an ongoing case.
In fact, despite her promotion, the judge continued to preside over another case in the same building.
A judge who had previously ruled against Tempo in Winata's civil suit filled her vacancy.
Finally, when Winata testified, he perjured himself by denying that Tempo had interviewed him.
A recording of the telephone interview was played in court; sworn testimony was heard from the reporter who conducted the interview and from two editors who witnessed it; the official record from the telephone company was submitted as evidence of the call; and an expert witness concluded that the voice on the recording belonged to Tomy Winata.
But the judges denied Tempo's request that Winata be arrested and tried for perjury, telling us to report it to the police, which we did.
The judges then denied our request for a postponement of the court decision until Mr. Winata's perjury case was resolved.
Given such flawed proceedings, my conviction and prison sentence come as no surprise.
But I remain hopeful that we will prevail in the end, when higher courts hear Tempo's appeal.
Indonesia's courts are cleaner at the top, and the Head of the Supreme Court is a staunch advocate of democracy and press freedom. Tempo's case could become a landmark victory for our democracy, like the US Supreme Court's famous decision in The New York Times v. Sullivan .
By raising the bar for defamation charges, that decision ensures that American journalists can hold public officials accountable.
No country knows better than Indonesia that free speech and a free press are proven indicators of democratic development, and that criminalizing journalists is an early symptom of authoritarianism.
Indonesia was a liberal democracy in the 1950's, before President Sukarno, supported by the military, began a crackdown on the press in 1956.
With critical voices silenced, consolidating unchecked power became easier and, in July 1959, Sukarno decreed the beginning of "Guided Democracy."
For the first few years after Sukarno's fall in 1966, all the benefits of genuine democracy, including freedom of the press, were restored (except for the communists).
But President Suharto's regime began another press crackdown in the early 1970's, ultimately banning various media and jailing many journalists.
With the press under control, other political rights were quickly curtailed and Indonesian democracy failed again.
Since Suharto's fall in 1998, Indonesia has become the third largest democratic country in the world and the largest democratic Muslim community in history.
Two parliamentary elections and two direct presidential elections - including the latest presidential run-off - have been free, fair, and peaceful, proving that Islam and democracy can coexist.
Democracy's enemies, however, never rest.
Radical Islamic groups have engaged in indiscriminate bombings, while groups with strong authoritarian tendencies have made inroads into President Megawati's inner circle.
But Mrs Megawati has just been defeated in her bid for reelection.
Will newly elected President Susilo continue to prosecute journalists?
Will my conviction, and the trials and convictions of other journalists, mark the beginning of the end of Indonesia's hard-won third democracy?
The answer lies in the support that Indonesian pro-democracy activists can generate domestically and internationally.
To lose Indonesia - a potential beacon of hope to all pro-democracy activists in the world Muslim community - would be a terrible defeat.
The Morality of Capital Punishment
The US is often criticized for its refusal to abolish capital punishment.
Many now claim that abolition of capital punishment is a precondition of a civilized criminal-law system.
Nobel laureate Gary Becker disagrees.
European governments are adamantly opposed to capital punishment -- the European Union bans it outright -- and some Europeans consider its use in the United States barbaric.
Indeed, many European intellectuals argue that not just capital punishment, but punishment in general, does not deter criminals.
But, whereas Europeans, with crime rates well below American rates for the past half-century, could long afford to be relatively "soft" on most crimes, they have seen their crime rates increase sharply during the past twenty years.
By contrast, American rates have fallen, in part because of greater use of punishment.
This includes capital punishment.
I support executing some people convicted of murder because -- and only because -- I believe that it deters other murders.
If I did not believe that, I would oppose capital punishment, because revenge and other possible motives should not be a basis for public policy.
Serious empirical research on capital punishment in the US began with a pioneering study by Isaac Ehrlich, published in 1975 in the American Economic Review.
Some subsequent studies have sometimes found a much weaker deterrent effect, while others have found a much stronger effect.
The available data are quite limited, however, so one should not base any conclusions solely on the econometric evidence.
Of course, public policy on any punishment cannot wait until the evidence is perfect.
But, even with the limited quantitative evidence available, there are good reasons to believe that capital punishment deters.
Most people, and murderers in particular, fear death, especially when it follows swiftly and with considerable certainty following the commission of a murder.
As David Hume put it in discussing suicide, "no man ever threw away life, while it was worth living.
For such is our natural horror of death…" Likewise, Schopenhauer believed that "as soon as the terrors of life reach a point at which they outweigh the terrors of death, a man will put an end to his life.
But the terrors of death offer considerable resistance…"
Opponents of capital punishment frequently proclaim that the state has no moral right to take anyone's life, including that of the most reprehensible murderer.
Yet that is absolutely the wrong conclusion for anyone who believes that capital punishment deters.
To see why, suppose that for each murderer executed (instead of, say, receiving life imprisonment), the number of murders is reduced by three, which is a much lower number than Ehrlich's and some other estimates of the deterrent effect.
This implies that for each murderer not executed, three innocent victims would die.
In fact, the government would indirectly be "taking" many lives if it did not use capital punishment.
Saving three innocent lives for every person executed seems like a very attractive trade-off, and even two lives saved per execution seems like a persuasive benefit-cost ratio for capital punishment.
Admittedly, however, the argument in favor of capital punishment becomes less clear-cut as the number of lives saved per execution falls.
But, even if only one life were saved per execution, the tradeoff might still be desirable if the life saved is much better than the life taken, which would usually be the case.
Many people object to comparing the quality of the life spared and the life taken.
Yet I do not see how to avoid such a comparison.
Consider a career criminal who robs and kills a victim who led a decent life and left several children and a spouse behind.
Suppose it would be possible to save the life of an innocent victim by executing such a criminal.
To me it is obvious that saving such a victim's life must count for more than taking the criminal's life.
Obviously, not all cases are so unambiguous, but a comparison of the qualities of individual lives must be part of any reasonable social policy.
This helps explain why capital punishment should be used only for murders, and not for lesser crimes.
When the tradeoff is between taking lives and, say, reducing property theft, the case for milder punishments is far stronger.
Although severe assaults, including some gruesome rapes, may approach some murders in severity, and might conceivably call for capital punishment, I do not support its use in these cases.
A powerful argument for reserving capital punishment for murders is "marginal deterrence."
If assault were punished with execution, perpetrators would have an incentive to kill their victims to avoid discovery (which is a major reason why the severity of punishments more generally should be matched to the severity of crimes).
One complication is that capital punishment may make a murderer fight harder to avoid being captured, which could lead to more deaths.
But, while marginal deterrence is important, I believe the resistance of murderers to being captured, possibly at the expense of their own lives, is really indirect evidence that criminals do fear capital punishment.
Of course, I worry about the risk of executing the innocent.
My support for capital punishment would weaken greatly if the rate of killing innocent people were as large as that claimed by many.
However, I believe that the appeal process in the US offers enormous protection, not so much against wrongful conviction as against wrongful execution, so that there are very few, if any, documented cases of innocent people being killed.
And this process has been strengthened enormously with the development of DNA identification.
Again, the debate about capital punishment is essentially a debate about deterrence (which may be reduced by lengthy appeals).
I can understand that some people are skeptical about the evidence, although I believe they are wrong about both that and the common sense of the issue.
It is very disturbing to take someone's life, even a murderer's life, but sometimes highly unpleasant actions are necessary to prevent even worse behavior that takes the lives of innocent victims.
The People Versus Putin
I helped select Vladimir Putin to succeed Russia's first democratically elected President, Boris Yeltsin.
Because KGB/Mafia structures now rule Russia and manipulate the judicial system, it is assumed that Yeltsin wanted to handpick his successor in order to avoid future prosecution.
But we who chose Putin were charged with finding someone to continue Yeltsin's reforms, not shield him and his family.
Indeed, Yeltsin was fearless, and sought not his personal survival, but the survival of the democratic idea that he introduced to Russia.
Yet that idea is now under threat because of the successor we chose.
I don't deny my responsibility for supporting Putin.
We weren't close friends, but he and I worked together in critical situations, and I never doubted his sincerity.
Putin acts according to his convictions.
The problem is that his convictions -- including his belief that Russia can prosper only if it is ruled by a single source of power -- are wrong.
This gross error is leading Russia to political ruin.
Of course, no one holds high office without making mistakes, even fundamental ones, and this is especially true in tumultuous periods.
Yeltsin was no exception, but he recognized his errors.
When he retired on New Year's Eve 1999, for example, he asked forgiveness for launching the war in Chechnya.
Putin, by contrast, seems incapable of recognizing and admitting his mistakes, and persists in a policy long after its failure is visible to the world.
One of Yeltsin's errors was his failure to put moral priorities at the head of his reform agenda.
Russia should have repented for Stalinism and the gulag system.
The whole nation, with no exception, should have repented, the way the Germans have repented since 1945.
This failure matters, for it allowed Putin's unqualified belief in central authority to lead to the recapture of the state by the security services.
Indeed, a direct result of national repentance for the gulag era should have been the banning of the communist party and the disqualification from political office of those who worked in the KGB.
Although such political screenings are complicated in postcommunist societies, where both victimhood and collaboration were so widespread -- and the lines between them so often blurred -- a sound solution could have been found, as in the Czech Republic.
Doing nothing left Russia's security structures unscathed and able to make a political comeback, which they have now achieved.
The political resurrection of KGB structures under Putin, and their efforts to silence dissent, has once again turned Russia into a country of defectors.
It is impossible to silence independent politicians and independent media without choking off independent sources of money, which is why Putin's Kremlin has concentrated its attacks on the so-called "oligarchs."
Mikhail Khodorkovsky's arrest and trial were orchestrated for precisely this reason.
By removing independent sources of money, the security services that dominate the Kremlin hope to destroy independent political life in Russia.
Without independent bases of thought, a climate of fear is taking hold.
But fear is not only degrading; it makes for poor governance.
Yeltsin intuitively understood that fear and top-down, centralized decision-making were no way to rule a modern country, and he therefore insisted on reforming relations between citizens and the state.
Putin still doesn't understand that a centralized political system is as incapable of comprehending and correcting mistakes now as it was in the Soviet era.
Not being a well-educated man Putin is, in full and deep sincerity, leading Russia toward the same disintegration that accompanied the collapse of the Soviet state.
People are beginning to realize this.
They see that Putin's desire to create a strong and effective modern state cannot be realized, because a modern state is governed not from above, but by an informed citizenry that forces its rulers to acknowledge and correct their mistakes.
Putin, too, also seems to suspect his regime's impotence.
This is one reason why Russia has become so aggressive with its neighbors, Ukraine and Georgia, and seeks to maintain a military presence in places like Transdniestria, the breakaway region of Moldova.
By throwing its weight around in Russia's near abroad, the Kremlin thinks that it can convince Russians back home of its omnipotence.
Given the neutered debates in Russia, and the Kremlin's ability to manipulate elections, regime change is the only option left for those who want to preserve the democratic idea in Russia.
There is no use holding onto illusions.
Those who oppose Putin must decide what they want and declare that, if the regime fails to uphold the constitution, they have the right to force it to do so by any means necessary.
Today, the question of power in Russia can no longer be decided solely at the ballot box.
As in Ukraine, Lebanon, and Kyrgizstan, it will be decided in the streets.
Tax and spend (Please)
Excessive taxation can dull incentives and hinder growth.
But too little taxation can do the same.
Governments with meager tax revenues can't provide basic public goods.
Worse yet, low tax revenues in poor countries often result from defects in tax collection systems (rather than low tax rates) that also promote unproductive enterprise.
India illustrates the importance of a well-designed tax system.
In Bangalore, high-tech companies have built world-class campuses replete with manicured lawns and high-speed data communication networks.
Outside these campuses, however, lie open sewers, uncollected garbage, and roads in acute disrepair.
Whereas technology companies instantaneously transmit terabytes of data to remote continents, local transport proceeds at an almost medieval pace.
As a result, businesses in Bangalore run their own bus services, contract with private suppliers for drinking water, and install generators to protect themselves from interruptions in electricity supply.
The state can't fix the shambles because it is broke.
India's government debt exceeds 70% of GDP, so more than half its tax receipts go to paying interest.
But the debt isn't because of excessive spending in the past.
India's government expenditures amount to about 15% of GDP, compared to an average of around 40% of GDP in the OECD.
Rather, India's financial difficulties stem from a badly designed and administered tax system.
Rates and rules for personal and corporate income taxes appear reasonable by international standards.
Nonetheless, India's government collects income taxes amounting to only about 3.7% of GDP, about half that in South Korea and the other Asian tigers.
Agriculture in India accounts for about a quarter of GDP, but even wealthy farmers don't pay taxes.
Export-oriented companies in the software and other industries enjoy tax holidays on their profits, although their employees do pay taxes on their personal incomes.
Despite reasonable rates, tax evasion is widespread.
Cheating occurs because the government hasn't invested in personnel or in the systems to detect tax evaders, who rarely face jail time and can often bribe their way out of trouble when they do get caught.
More subtly, the evasion of "direct" taxes on incomes and profits reflects the mess in the system of "indirect" taxes levied on production and consumption.
Excise taxes account for over 60% of India's indirect taxes, which in turn represent the same proportion of its total tax receipts.
The basic excise tax has been fixed at 16% of the value of a firm's output.
Then there are a variety of concessions, exemptions, and surcharges.
For instance a "concessionary duty rate" of 8% is levied on categories like food products, matches, cotton yarn, and computers.
An additional "special excise duty" (SED) of 8% is levied on products that include polyester filament, cars, air conditioners and tires.
An "additional excise duty" (AED, not to be confused with the SED) is levied on "goods of special importance."
Exemptions from excise taxes are numerous and complex, including businesses with total annual revenues of less than 10 million rupees and firms located in certain troubled or backward areas.
Overall, the exemptions fall under 70 broad categories, subdivided into 259 entries, 52 conditions, and 7 lists, each containing numerous items.
Exemptions invite abuse.
For a price, low ranking officials, who have considerable discretion in applying the conditions, can be persuaded to reach favorable interpretations.
Goods taxed at high rates (for example, polished granite) are sold as goods taxed at lower rates (for example, as unpolished granite).
Evasion of excise taxes is more contagious than evasion of taxes on profits and incomes.
If one firm evades excise taxes, and the tax rate is high compared to pre-tax profit margins in the industry, its competitors also have to cheat, just in order to survive.
As evasion increases, governments levy "additional" or "special" duties, inciting further evasion.
Collections of direct taxes also suffer.
The bribe paid to the excise tax collector for a favorable classification, the difference between the value of polished and unpolished granite, and the under-reporting of true revenues create "black" funds, which cannot be declared on income-tax returns.
In addition to impairing the state's ability to provide basic public goods, schemes to evade indirect taxes also discourage businesses from adopting more productive technologies, which requires technologies that involve large-scale operation.
But, because indirect taxes are more easily avoided by operating many small units instead of one large unit, economies of scale cannot be realized.
It's worth noting that in the software industry, where all units are exempt from indirect taxes, Indian companies do operate at efficient scale.
Could India emulate China's example, where the rationalization of indirect taxes in 1994 set the stage for a great boom?
Or are coalition governments in a vigorous democracy incapable of such reform?
Last year India's BJP-led government introduced legislation mandating sharp reductions in the budget deficit.
It then appointed a task force to formulate the necessary changes in tax and spending policies.
This July, the task force proposed raising taxes (rather than cutting spending), through, among other things, removing most indirect tax exemptions.
India's new Congress-led government, too, seems to favor these proposals.
If Congress and the opposition parties follow through, they will go a long way to sustaining the country's economic growth and in dispelling the idea that democracies cannot do what's needed to encourage development.
What's Wrong With Turkey?
On December 16, Orhan Pamuk, one of Turkey's most famous writers, will enter an Istanbul court to face a charge of "insulting the national identity" after he advocated open discussion of the Turkish genocide of 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 and 1916.
Pamuk faces three years in prison.
Turkey's effort to fine and imprison those who do not toe the official line convinces me that I was correct to oppose opening negotiations on the country's European Union membership.
In December 1999, the European Council granted Turkey the status of EU candidate-member, implying that Turkey would accede to the Union at some future, unspecified date.
The Council subsequently asked the European Commission to decide by October 2004 whether Turkey had sufficiently fulfilled the political criteria -- including democracy, the rule of law, and respect for the rights of ethnic minorities -- for membership.
That decision was one of the last taken by Romano Prodi's Commission, of which I was a member.
Of its 30 members, 29 said that Turkey had fulfilled the criteria sufficiently to proceed.
I was the lone dissenter.
The Commission's own report on Turkey, prepared by Günter Verheugen, who was then in charge of EU enlargement, shaped my decision.
This report mentioned that in 2003 some 21,870 Turks submitted asylum claims in the EU, of which 2,127 were accepted.
In other words, the EU's own governments acknowledged in 2003 that the Turkish government had persecuted more than 2,000 of its own citizens.
Meanwhile, the Commission published a progress report on Turkey that granted that reforms were continuing, albeit at a slower pace, under Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's mildly Islamic-minded government.
Yet the report also presented serious misgivings: human rights violations, including torture, continued; the military's influence remained too high; freedom of speech was not universally observed; non-Muslim religious and cultural minorities faced discrimination; and violence against women was not opposed strongly enough.
Not much has changed since accession talks began this October.
Beyond the current persecution of Pamuk, unacceptable behavior abounds.
In March 2005, the police violently disrupted a demonstration to celebrate International Women's Day.
In May, the largest teachers' union was banned for promoting the education of Turkey's 14 million Kurds in their own language.
Indeed, intolerance goes right to the top of the Turkish government.
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gül abruptly cancelled a recent press conference in Copenhagen when he spied a Kurdish journalist in the audience and the Danes refused to evict him.
Such actions and attitudes amply justify my dissent of October 2004.
But, even if these shortcomings were removed, Turkey should still not be admitted to the EU, because it is not a European country.
Christianity, feudalism, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, democracy, and industrialization have made us what we Europeans are, but they have not made Turks who they are.
So I am not convinced that reforms in Turkey implemented at the insistence of the European Commission would continue after accession.
Indeed, I suspect that there will be backsliding.
Moreover, Turkey's accession would lead inevitably to that of Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova, and perhaps of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaïdjan.
The first three of these countries are certainly more European than Turkey.
Leaving the three Caucasian republics aside but including the successor states to Yugoslavia, this would mean an EU of some 35 members.
What sort of Union would that be?
The EU is not simply a club of friends.
It is based on freedom of movement of goods, services, capital, and people.
The Commission, as the guardian of the Union's treaties, must protect these four fundamental freedoms, which means that it must sometimes persuade, and if necessary force, member states to change their laws.
Alcohol policy in Sweden, the Volkswagen-law in Germany, and discrimination against foreign investment funds in France are examples of cases that made the Commission unpopular.
But they were necessary.
By the time I left the Commission, I was sitting on a pile of 1,500 such infringement proceedings.
In short, EU membership entails having to accept incisive measures that deeply affect a state's internal affairs.
That will be impossible with such disparate members.
The EU would fall victim to what the historian Paul Kennedy calls "imperial overreach."
The EU would become unacceptably diluted.
That is why former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing feared that Turkey's entry would lead to the EU's breakup, and it is why former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said, "Accession of Turkey would be more than the EU could bear."
But the strongest reason to oppose Turkey's accession is a question of democracy: a majority of the EU's population simply does not want it.
Bolivia's Crisis, Latin America's Failure
Bolivia is not a typical Latin American country by any definition.
But for Haiti, it is the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, and it is even less stable, with a history of more than two hundred coups since independence.
In a region with a strong indigenous past but a scattered and isolated present, Bolivia is, alongside Guatemala, perhaps the only country in Latin America where indigenous peoples make up a majority of the population.
Its topography and ethnic distribution are generating autonomist and even secessionist forces that threaten national unity in more menacing ways than anywhere else.
And, of course, it is, with Paraguay, the only land-locked nation on the sub-continent.
So it would be highly imprudent to extrapolate Bolivia's current crisis to the rest of Latin America.
It is far too simple to generalize: institutions elsewhere are much stronger, poverty -- and particularly extreme poverty -- have been diminishing, and the battle over natural resources has been largely settled.
Even in places like Venezuela, with both huge oil reserves and a traditional-minded nationalist government, the status quo allowing for foreign investment in energy resources has survived nearly eight years of President Hugo Chavez.
While the existence of indigenous movements is a reality in many countries, from Chiapas to "Araucania," from Amazonia to Ayacucho, nowhere in Latin America have they posed a genuine threat to national integrity.
So Bolivia is not a premonitory crisis; nor does the hoary old "domino theory," to which both Lyndon Johnson and Che Guevara subscribed in the case of Bolivia, seem valid or even half-way reasonable.
Yet Bolivia's current crisis does point to the "democratic deficit" that plagues Latin America today.
Elected leaders have fallen for one reason or another in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Haiti.
Democracy is either defective or missing in Cuba, Mexico, and Nicaragua, and it is threatened by one cause or another in Venezuela and Colombia.
None of these cases are identical to the others; they include varying degrees of danger, harm, or reconciliation.
The question is what can be done about this state of affairs, which contrasts starkly with the encouraging outlook that prevailed just a few years back.
At the last Organization of American States assembly in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the United States delegation took a good idea from others and, by its support, essentially sank it.
The story began a couple of years ago, when former Argentine Foreign Minister Dante Caputo and the United Nations Development Program were charged with drafting the Latin American Democracy Report.
They concluded that an early warning system for democratic crises in the region would help generate action before matters got out of control, as in Bolivia today.
Caputo and the UN team then convinced Chilean President Ricardo Lagos to take up the initiative and to promote it with several of his colleagues.
He did, but the initiative did not get very far.
In fact, The UNDP/Latin America Democracy Report, published in 2004, barely mentioned it.
The US and the new Chilean Secretary General of the OAS, Jose Miguel Insulza, resurrected the plan during the OAS meeting in Florida, but it was shot down by Latin Americans' reasonable fears that the idea was directed against Venezuela, mingled with Latin Americans' anachronistic fears of violating the sacrosanct principle of non-intervention.
Despite the continent's failure to agree on the principle, the idea of an early-warning system deserves attention.
Today there may be little that the hemispheric community can do about the situation in Bolivia, and yet it is fraught with danger for everyone.
Evo Morales, the leader of the opposition and of the coca-leaf growers, may be an honest, if misguided, democratic leader, but are his followers untainted by authoritarian desires?
Hugo Chavez may not be financing Morales and Bolivia's other dissidents, but are Venezuela and Cuba really not tempted to meddle in the country where Che Guevara died leading a guerrilla war nearly 40 years ago?
Bolivia's Santa Cruz business community may not carry out its threat to secede, but will they prefer to share their region's oil and gas reserves with the indigenous highland peoples rather than with Brazilian industrialists from São Paulo?
Before events reached these extremes, it might have been a good idea for the OAS (not the US) to get involved.
The region continues to need that involvement -- on time, on message, and on a proper democratic platform, one that is distinct from both traditional US intervention and Latin America's traditional indifference.
The Decline of France?
The French are notoriously sensitive--if not defensive--about France's stature in the world.
The French state spends vast amounts of money to propagate the French language and French culture, yet the French are painfully aware that the global position of their country is not what it once was.
No surprise, then, that during the last presidential election, the publication of a European Commission report claiming France's economic rank among European countries had fallen from 3
The OECD and Eurostat, the European body in charge of such data, thought they put an end to this aspect of the debate by showing that France, Germany, Italy, and Great Britain all enjoy roughly equal per capita living standards.
But the broader controversy wouldn't go away.
Worried talk about "French decline" reappeared with this year's street protests against pension reform, mounting disputes over fiscal policy with the European Commission, and bickering with America over the war in Iraq.
Today's best-selling non-fiction book in France is a polemic by Nicolas Baverez, La France qui tombe (Falling France).
Baverez's book is filled with quotations from de Gaulle and Napoleon.
According to the author, France's last great achievements were in the 1970's, when the fast train, the TGV, and Airbus were launched.
He castigates both Mitterrand and Chirac for their "common talent to win elections and turn France into a loser."
The book's success is itself a sign of a kind of "malaise."
But of which kind?
Baverez's evidence of degeneration is not as convincing as he believes.
For example, he cites the draining away of industrial jobs as the most glaring evidence of France's decline.
But deindustrialization is common to all advanced countries.
Indeed, France does actually better than most of its rich country rivals and, unlike Germany, the UK, or the US, has retained the same global market share in the industrial sector that it had in the early 1970's.
Moreover, according to a better measure of comptetitiveness, foreign investment, France does very well.
According to a recent report by the Economic Analysis Council, direct investment in France grew to 60 billion euros in 2001, almost twice that of Germany.
French cost competitiveness also improved (by 20%) in the last three decades, with higher productivity offsetting rapid wage growth.
But the core of France's long-run economic problems is precisely the fear of losing industrial jobs.
France remains a strong industrial power in traditional areas such as automobile and aerospace industries, but it is falling behind in innovative markets, where smaller companies spread new technologies.
France, for instance, spends only $30 billion annually on high tech R&D, compared with $51 billion in Germany, $98 billion in Japan, and $265 billion in the US.
In short, Baverez's analysis points in the wrong direction.
France has undergone a set of critically important reforms over the past two decades: economic and financial liberalization, elimination of price and foreign exchange controls, the end of credit restrictions, European liberalization, reduced inflation and trade deficits, the advent of the euro and the forced globalization of the country's firms.
The French malaise has nothing to do with any of them.
France's problem is that it fails to recognize the new world of which it already is a part.
French state capitalism is dead, and France is finding it hard to come to terms with its passing.
Indeed, France must be the only country in which a Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, feels obliged to apologize the day after for saying on TV that "the state is not omnipotent."
There are many reasons for this French schyzophrenia, but a critical one has to do with the political game of the past 20 years.
Until 1981, France had a clear division between right and left.
Since then, both the Mitterand and Chirac administrations blunted their ideological edge in order to carry the difficult process of adjustment towards Europe and globalization.
A round of "shock therapy" à la Mrs. Thatcher two decades ago might have forged a new political consciousness.
But the consensual dribbling out of reforms allowed the French to live in one world and think in another.
This is a key reason for the political cataclysm that exploded during the last presidential campaign, when the far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen reached the second round of the presidential election, ahead of the incumbent Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin.
The rise of the extreme left, which gathered 10% of the vote during that presidential campaign, also attests to this political failure.
France needs a political revolution more than an economic one if it is to come to terms with reality, part of which is that "French decline" is a fear of the French people's own making.
The Value of European Values
Europe's leaders have revived the constitutional talks that broke down last December in a dispute about voting rights.
Such disputes are, of course, subject to compromises, which are likely to be found.
What still needs to be settled is a clear understanding of what the constitution is meant to achieve.
Two fundamental principles have underpinned European integration: solidarity and subsidiarity.
Both principles lie at the crossroads of philosophy, politics, economics, sociology, and law.
For years they have been present in the legal and institutional framework of the European Union - in treaties, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (which quotes them in the Preamble), in the recent draft Constitution.
They are, in short, inscribed in the EU's history and ideals.
But what do solidarity and subsidiarity really mean?
Consider solidarity, which is open to at least two interpretations: static solidarity, which concerns only the distribution of income and wealth, and the broader concept of dynamic solidarity, which concerns the production of income and wealth as well.
In the postwar history of European integration, dynamic solidarity was strong in the first period - that of the European Coal and Steel Community - both in its economic development strategy (reconstruction) and in the Treaties, particularly the Treaty of Rome.
This does not mean that dynamic solidarity was subsequently suppressed: European Monetary Union, for example, is an expression of it.
Some countries did not immediately benefit from the euro, but accepted it for the sake of solidarity. They were convinced that it would have positive effects in the long run.
Dynamic solidarity, in other words, means favoring policies that foster investment, innovation, economic growth, and employment.
However, as GDP growth in the EU indicates, dynamic solidarity has been undermined over the last decade.
What is particularly worrying is the research and development lag.
Realization of the EU's so-called Lisbon strategy, adopted in 2000 with the promise of creating the world's most competitive economy, is threatened by a growing emphasis on static solidarity, reflected in high social welfare costs and the high taxes needed to finance them.
The primacy of static solidarity is due to an aging population, which, along with slower growth, has led to structural fiscal imbalances.
One of the biggest challenges for the future of the EU is addressing today's prevalence of static solidarity oriented towards old people over dynamic solidarity favoring young people.
After all, the Union cannot afford to permit current consumption to continue to prevail over the investment needed to ensure future prosperity.
Subsidiarity is similar to the concept of solidarity in that it, too, has two interpretations: vertical subsidiarity and horizontal subsidiarity.
Vertical subsidiarity concerns the distribution of powers among different levels of government and sovereignty: the EU, national states, regions, and municipalities.
The best-known application of this principle is federalism.
In the European Treaties, we find a clear expression of vertical subsidiarity.
But is this enough to encompass the emerging institutional and constitutional settings of the Union?
Horizontal subsidiarity concerns the responsibility and freedom of human beings, as well as social and economic powers.
It encompasses the relations between state, society, and market.
But society and the market have their own rights and sovereignties that are not granted by the state.
So the problem comes in assuring the autonomy of each realm.
An example of horizontal subsidiarity is the internal European market, which created a new kind of economic freedom and increased competition between firms because they are no longer protected by national governments.
Horizontal subsidiarity means that in both society and the economic sphere, the state cannot violate individual freedom and responsibility, which must be respected to the greatest possible extent.
It also means that support must be given by a "superior power" whenever individual freedom and responsibility do not suffice to achieve the ends necessary for human dignity.
This support, however, should be implemented in ways that the natural potential of individuals, society, and the market is promoted.
But that is possible only when the role of horizontal subsidiarity is clearly formulated, which it has not been in the European Treaties, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, or the work of the European Convention.
In short, solidarity has come to mean redistribution rather than growth (which is how today's generation expresses solidarity with respect to future generations), while subsidiarity has come to mean the distribution of political power, rather than a careful delineation of the boundaries between the state, civil society, and the market.
Today, both values are defined in ways that favor the state.
Indeed, focusing on market-based growth has often been identified with the semi-alien values of America.
But these values are deeply ingrained in Europe, and should be brought out again.
The EU should restore its economic vitality by pursuing a model of solidarity and subsidiarity that is more balanced in favor of the market and society, and that reduces the state's socio-economic influence.
State institutions should deliver public goods (like defense, justice, and fiscal and monetary policy), society should deliver social goods (like culture, education, and assistance to needy people), and the market should deliver economic goods (which are connected with profits, growth, and employment).
In the 21st century, Europe must reconsider the value of both principles - solidarity and subsidiarity - if it is to attain integration's historic goal: the freedom and well being needed to overcome the differences and political divisions that incited tragedy in the 20th century.
That is the spirit in which the European Constitution must be written.
The Politics of Values
The debate about the American elections has still not abated.
How did President George W. Bush manage to get three million votes more than Senator John Kerry, and, in addition, to have a Republican majority elected in both houses of Congress?
There is not much agreement on the answers, but two themes recur in many explanations.
One is personality.
At a time of uncertainty and threat, people had more confidence in the president they knew than in the candidate who seemed unproven.
The second theme is values.
People voted for a set of values rather than for specific policies.
Indeed, some (it is said) agreed with Kerry's policies but nevertheless gave their vote to Bush, because they felt "at ease" with his general attitudes.
Clearly, the United States is now deeply divided in electoral terms.
An arch of blue (Democratic) states in the East, North, and West spans a huge red (Republican) area in the middle and the South.
More than that, the divisions are reproduced at the local level.
Gerrymandering -- the drawing of electoral boundaries to benefit a particular political party -- is no longer necessary.
People actually tend to move to areas in which a majority of others share their values, whether Republican or Democratic.
What exactly are these values?
They have to do, or so we hear, with "god, guns, and gays."
Religion plays a part in them, including the literal truth of the bible when it comes to the story of the creation.
The possession of a gun is the ultimate test of individualism, and using guns in wars is not abhorrent.
Gays and other "modern" practices are rejected as self-indulgent.
As the political scientist Andrew Hacker recently put it, "the Bush candidacy was framed to make a majority by giving some 60 million people a chance to feel good about themselves."
Is all this an American phenomenon, or are there similar trends elsewhere?
One answer is that as an American phenomenon, the politics of values may command a majority now, but it is by no means general.
Europe and other parts of the world are equally divided.
Personality undoubtedly matters, and beneath overt political differences there may also be issues of values that have not yet come to the fore.
But traditional political differences based on disagreement over fundamental values play a diminishing part in elections.
For example, Prime Minister Tony Blair, the next major leader to face an election, plays the personality card and talks about policies, but he represents above all a set of middle-class values.
When he speaks of "modernization," or of "bringing things into the twenty-first century," he manages to suggest a strange but appealing mixture of change and stability.
This has left the Conservative opposition without an effective response.
Even questions like tax cuts and stricter asylum rules do not quite hit the value chords that the Republican Party in the US has managed to touch.
The picture is similar in Germany, where the overt influence of value politics is even smaller.
The German debate is still largely a policy debate.
When the opposition offers the government talks on health-care reform or, most recently, on combating unemployment, the underlying competition is about competence rather than values.
Yet underneath the common battlegrounds of political debate in Britain and Germany and elsewhere in Europe, value clashes are lurking.
Parties fight for those who can be made "to feel good about themselves," but they may not fully realize that this is only partly a matter of policy.
Religion is not likely to become a major factor in European politics; opinion polls show that religious observance marks one of the few major differences between Americans and Europeans.
Guns also have a different place in the European mind; it is their absence that most Europeans regard as important.
A pacifist streak of values is also unmistakable in Europe.
But the issue of political correctness ("gays") plays a so-far underrated part in Europe as well.
Most importantly, the Europe itself divides Europeans, as the "national question" arises in each European state.
It is an issue of values, inspired by fear.
People want to know where they belong, and in the process they turn against the US and toward Europe, or against Europe and toward their country.
Either way, we leave the realms of policies, and even of politics, and enter the murky domain of symbols and myth.
This, at any rate, is the main risk that democratic countries face, for the politics of values is a dangerous development.
It reintroduces fundamental divisions in societies whose greatest democratic achievement was precisely to banish fundamentalism from politics.
Enlightened public debate must be a dispute about policies contained by a community of values.
Insisting on this is therefore a primary objective of the politics of freedom.
The Coming Age of Interest
One swallow does not make a summer, and one month of normal job growth, and rising prices in the United States does not mean that the Federal Reserve no longer fears economic malaise and deflation.
But the time will come when world interest rates begin to rise, as central bankers prepare to resist the upward creep of inflation.
Whenever that moment arrives - whether this fall, in 2005 or 2006, or in 2007 - America and the global economy will face financial vulnerabilities that reflect the success of the past three years of monetary stimulation in stemming declines in production and moderating unemployment.
Short-term interest rates are astonishingly low: only 2% in the euro zone, just 1% in the US, and zero in Japan.
Expansionary monetary policy has been successful, but only by pushing interest rates to historic lows - and by convincing investors that borrowing costs will remain at their current levels for a long time.
The main result of monetary stimulus has been to boost asset prices: anything that pays a yield, a dividend, or a rent becomes much more attractive - and hence much more valuable in money terms - when interest rates are very low and expected to stay very low.
This explains the large gaps between current prices for real estate in the US, equities in New York, London, and Frankfurt, and long-term bonds everywhere and what one would conventionally think their fundamental values should be.
So what will happen when central banks start raising interest rates?
In 1994, rising short-term rates caused increases in long-term rates - and declines in long-term bond prices - that were at least double what standard models at the time were predicting.
Moreover, interest rates in the world's peripheral, developing economies rose far more than rates in the advanced industrial core.
Thus, the first danger to worry about for 2005 and beyond - when world interest rates will most likely rise - is another wave of emerging-market financial crises.
For countries like Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Argentina, Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand, the record of the 1990's demonstrates that interest-rate spreads can widen and capital flows reverse remarkably rapidly, regardless of how favorably IMF officials and analyses by major banks view a country's policies.
Emerging-market interest-rate spreads now are abnormally low.
International money flows - aside from inflows into the US - are not yet at levels associated with "irrational exuberance," but there is still time for that to happen before interest rates start to rise.
This is an alarming prospect, because if there is one lesson from the 1990's, it is that nobody should overestimate the stability of international financial flows.
The second danger springs from high asset values within the advanced industrial core.
The dominant mode of thought within the Federal Reserve - with which I agree - appears to be that the information-technology revolution is continuing, that the pace of growth of potential output in the US remains very fast, and that the output gap is thus relatively wide.
This implies that interest rates may, in fact, need to stay low for a very considerable period.
Moreover, confidence in the Federal Reserve is high, and the last remnants of the 1970's inflation risk premium have been wrung out of interest rates.
As a result, even after output levels return to their potential, interest rates will stay low by the standards of the 1980's and the 1990's.
All of this is, of course, good news for those who own assets like long-term bonds, stocks, and real estate.
Indeed, elevating long-term asset prices was precisely the point of lowering interest rates: making bondholders and especially real estate owners richer, after all, provides a fillip to spending.
But the bad news is that even if interest rates are expected to remain low for a while, they will not stay this low indefinitely.
The bottom line is that when interest rates rise, asset values will fall.
It is during such periods - particularly when asset values fall swiftly and substantially - that we discover exactly how good our central bankers are at their main job: reducing financial volatility and promoting economic stability.
It is also during such periods that we discover how many people who are holding long-term bonds, real estate, or stocks are doing so not because they think current prices are attractive relative to fundamentals, but because their prices have gone up over the past several years.
This is a crucial question for policy makers, because those who bought long-term assets due to what seemed like perpetually rising prices are also those who will sell as soon as price trends seem to be reversing.
In particular, the US trade deficit looms as a massive source of instability should long-term asset prices fall significantly.
To be sure, the challenges facing the world's economic policy makers during the next several years will be different from those that they have faced since the collapse of the NASDAQ bubble.
The risks associated with inflation are probably less dangerous than those generated by collapsing output and the threat of deflation.
But, as we learned in the 1990's, this does not mean that the coming challenges will be easier to handle.
America's Opposing Futures
I recently learned something interesting: American international finance economists and American domestically oriented macroeconomists have very different -- indeed, opposing -- views of the likely consequences of America's huge current-account deficit.
International finance economists see a financial crisis as likely, followed by a painful and perhaps prolonged recession in the United States.
Domestically oriented macroeconomists, by contrast, see a forthcoming fall in the value of the dollar not as a crisis, but as an opportunity to accelerate growth.
Domestically oriented macroeconomists look at the situation roughly like this: at some point in the future, foreign central banks will become less willing to continue buying massive amounts of dollar-denominated securities in order to prop up the greenback.
When they cease their large-scale dollar-purchase programs, the value of the dollar will fall -- and it will fall hard.
But, according to this view, as the dollar's value declines, US exports will become more attractive to foreigners and American employment will rise, with labor re-allocated to the newly-vibrant export sector.
It will be like what happened in Britain after it abandoned its exchange-rate peg and allowed the pound to depreciate relative to the Deutschmark , or what happened in the US in the late 1980's, when the dollar depreciated against the pound, the Deutschmark , and -- most importantly -- the Japanese yen.
International finance economists see a far bleaker future.
They see the end of large-scale dollar-purchase programs by central banks leading not only to a decline in the dollar, but also to a spike in US long-term interest rates, which will curb consumption spending immediately and throttle investment spending after only a short lag.
To be sure, international finance economists also see US exports benefiting as the value of the dollar declines, but the lags in demand are such that the export boost will come a year or two after the decline in consumption and investment spending.
Eight to ten million people will have to shift employment from services and construction into exports and import-competing goods, implying that structural unemployment will rise.
Moreover, there may be a financial panic: large financial institutions with short-term liabilities and long-term assets will have a difficult time weathering a large rise in long-term dollar-denominated interest rates.
This mismatch can cause financial stress and bankruptcy just as easily as banks' local-currency assets and dollar liabilities caused stress and bankruptcy in the Mexican and East Asian crises of the 1990's and in the Argentinean crisis of this decade.
When international finance economists sketch this scenario, domestically oriented macroeconomists respond that it sounds like a case of incompetent monetary policy.
Why should the Federal Reserve allow long-term interest rates to spike just because other central banks have ceased their dollar-purchase programs?
Should not the Fed step in and replace them with its own purchases of long-term US Treasury bonds, thereby keeping long-term interest rates at a level conducive to full employment?
To this, international finance economists respond that the Fed does not have the power to do so.
When forced to choose between full employment and price stability, the international finance economists say that the Fed will choose price stability, because its institutional memory of the 1970's, when inflation ran rampant, remains very strong.
Therefore, since a fall in the value of the dollar raises import prices, and thus functions as a negative shock to the supply side of the economy, the Fed will have to raise, not lower, interest rates, and sell, not buy, bonds.
Serious economists whom I respect enormously find themselves taking strong positions on opposite sides of this debate.
I'm not wise enough to say which side is right, but I certainly know which side I hope is wrong.
Europe's Free Riders
In the United States, individual states that follow unsound fiscal policies face a penalty.
Their bonds sell at a discount relative to those of better-managed individual states.
The higher debt service they must pay serves -- to some degree -- as a form of discipline against the temptation to spend now and pay later.
Of course, the discipline of the market is not perfect: the bond market does not "see" implicit future liabilities (like promised pension payments) to any great degree.
Nevertheless, this enforced fiscal discipline, combined with individual states' own internal budgetary procedures, has prevented a large scale state-level fiscal crisis from occurring in the US since the Great Depression.
Let us now turn to Europe.
Before the advent of the euro, there were many fiscal crises in individual nation-states in southern Europe, which produced waves of high inflation.
But, with the single currency in place, the road to solving a fiscal crisis through inflation has been closed, as the European Central Bank (ECB) now stands watch over monetary policy.
Nevertheless, even with nation-states no longer able to rely on inflation to solve their unbalanced finances, the single currency allows them to use the debt capacity properly belonging to other members of the European Union to extend their spending sprees and postpone political accountability for periods of laissez les bons temps roulés.
To head off this possibility, the EU created the Stability and Growth Pact: government deficits had to be less than 3% of GDP.
Last week, the government of Germany -- once the most fiscally prudent and disciplined EU country -- broke the pact's rules for fiscal discipline for the fifth consecutive year, and did so without (much) apology.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck signaled that he expected the European Commission to apply some sanctions to Germany: the credibility of the pact would, he said, be at stake if no action were taken.
Thus, Germany would not block sanctions this time, as it did two and a half years ago.
But Steinbrueck also made it clear that he expects any sanctions in response to Germany's predicted 3.4%-of-GDP fiscal deficit to be largely symbolic, not penalties that would cost its government or economy anything of significance.
The Stability and Growth Pact is not -- or is not yet -- working anywhere near the way it was intended to work.
What about market discipline?
Is the German government's willingness to issue more debt and run bigger deficits limited because the market recognizes and penalizes nation states that allow their fiscal positions to weaken?
In a word, no.
The interest rates on the euro-denominated sovereign debt of the twelve euro-zone governments are all very similar.
So the market does not seem to care that countries have different potentials to generate exports to fund the financial flows needed for debt repayments, or different current and projected debt-to-GDP ratios.
Willem Buiter of the University of Amsterdam and Anne Sibert of the University of London believe that it is the ECB's willingness to, in effect, accept all euro-zone debt as collateral that has undermined the market's willingness to be an enforcer of fiscal prudence.
As long as the marginal piece of German debt is used as collateral for a short-term loan or as the centerpiece of a repurchase agreement to gain liquidity, its value is much more likely to be determined by the terms on which the ECB accepts it as collateral than by its fundamentals.
The ECB's treatment of all such debt as equally powerful sources of back-up liquidity now trumps any analysis of differences in long-term sovereign risk.
In the long run, this is dangerous.
Both market discipline and sound fiscal management are needed to create a reasonable chance of long-run price stability.
Omit either a market penalty now for behavior that may become reckless or the institutional levers that give a voice to future generations, and you run grave risks -- perhaps not today or tomorrow, but someday, and for the rest of your life.
As time passes, the coming of the single currency and the way that the euro has been implemented is generating more and more unease.
Policy as a whole over the entire euro zone is too deflationary.
The necessary transfers are not being made to make the common currency bearable to regions that lose out and are already in recession when the ECB tightens policy.
The institutional foundations of stable long-run fiscal policy are being eroded.
And now, Buiter and Sibert argue convincingly, the ECB is giving the market less scope to reward the thrifty and penalize the profligate than it should.
There is no movement of the soil yet, and there will not be for some time.
But the ground under the euro may well begin to shift if things don't change.
Milosevic and Hussein: Trial by Farce
Trials of war criminals were once serious business.
Recall the photographs of Herman Goering and Rudolf Hess sitting glumly in the dock at Nuremberg.
Some Nazi leaders were even hanged after relatively short but fair trials.
Nowadays, legal proceedings against the world's most wicked leaders have become farce.
The trial of Saddam Hussein and his Ba'athist cronies offers an ongoing series of embarrassments.
The defendants try one antic after another, and Hussein shows every form of contempt possible except "mooning" the judge.
It is hard to expect an outcome that will appear legitimate in the eyes of Iraqis or the world.
Meanwhile, Slobodan Milosevic's trial morphed into a funeral after four boring years of testimony and a sunken cost of more than $200 million.
In Cambodia, the United Nations and the government have dickered for almost a decade about how to bring surviving Khmer Rouge figures to trial.
The mass killers who took power in the twentieth century were doomed to being killed in popular revolts or to being tried for their crimes -- that is, if they did not die in power.
Who can be proud that Romania's last Communist boss, Nicolai Ceaucescu, and his wife were shot without even the semblance of a fair trial?
The formal trappings of a real court always seem better than instant justice, even if the end result is also death.
Today there are two plausible ways to proceed against a deposed tyrant.
A nation could put its own former leaders on trial, as the Argentines did in the 1980's with the generals responsible for the disappearance of more than 5,000 fellow citizens.
At the international level, the Nuremberg model remains available to generate further trials, though under the dubious conditions that victorious powers sometimes impose liability for crimes, such as "crimes against humanity" that were are not properly defined at the time they are committed.
There was a time when we could see the advantages of both national and international trials.
Home grown trials enabled the local community to work out its grief by participating closely in the process.
As judges and juries, the defendant's compatriots could also bring greater sensitivity to the assessment of guilt because they appreciated the tough conditions under which a deposed dictator made his decisions.
Argentina's trial of the generals was a successful ritual in the painstaking transition from military junta to democracy, but the experience ended with weeping self-doubt.
Even after conviction, the generals were sufficiently strong to exact a termination of the trials and then a pardon from the succeeding president.
Argentine politics is still embroiled in the legal consequences of those trials of 20 years ago.
At the international level, the UN Security Council's decision to establish the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was also greeted with great confidence.
The ICTY did make several foundational decisions under the leadership of Antonio Cassese.
But then the judges had the misfortune of realizing their fondest dream -- trying in their court the arch-villain Slobodan Milosevic.
It is not clear how the Serbs would have handled Milosevic in a local trial.
A lot would have depended on the political party that controlled the court.
At the international level, the fear was not of too much politics but of too much law.
Milosevic's trial had to be more than fair, it had to be an emblem of UN Justice.
Thus Milosevic was allowed to defend himself -- a huge mistake in terms of the trial's length and efficiency.
There was no limit on the number of witnesses the prosecution called to testify about the same gruesome story of Serbian aggression and brutality.
It will take many months to determine what went wrong and why the trial lasted a scandalous four years.
My hunch is that the court's well-meaning officials were too influenced by the South African Peace and Reconciliation Commission, a model touted in law schools as the desired alternative to retributive justice.
In the South African proceedings the most important question was not the future of the defendant but the past of the victims.
Every victim was encouraged to tell his story and the defendant listened.
In the case of massacres endured in the twentieth century, such storytelling can last decades.
Encouraging victims to speak and then giving the defendant the right to filibuster the proceedings by touting his merits as a political leader amounts to a formula for infinite delay.
One lesson we have learned from both the Milosevic and Hussein trials is that one should not put men or women on trial in order to terminate their charismatic appeal.
They will turn the trial around -- particularly if they are allowed to defend themselves -- and use the courtroom to vindicate their careers.
Tyrants should be tried only after they are clearly defeated.
Ironically, it was an advantage of the Nuremberg courts that they were staffed by the representatives of the victorious powers.
They were a constant reminder to Goering, Hess, and their henchmen that the Allies were in charge, that the Nazis were irreversibly defeated.
Punishing the guilty, rather than shaping the way history would be written, was always the clear objective of the trial.
The tragedy of the Milosevic and Hussein trials is that the "i"s of history were not yet fully dotted and history itself was on trial.
The resulting hesitancy of those in charge gave rise to procedures -- both international and national -- that facilitated fantasies of vindication and return.
In the case of Hussein, that fantasy may yet become real.
Iraq's Economic Divide
Everyone who looks at Iraq sees a nation divided between Shia, Sunni, and Kurd communities.
But an equally fundamental division -- one that has contributed as much to the ongoing insurrection as sectarian strife and opposition to the American-led military occupation -- is the widening gap between Iraq's rich and poor.
When Iraq was liberated, most people, especially the poor, began to hope for a charismatic leader who would save them from the bitter reality of daily life.
Raised in fear, they had no idea how democracy could apply to their society, or how human-rights groups and other civic organizations could help shape the future.
Soon enough, Iraq was faced with a new social divide.
On one side stood people who understood how to operate in a democracy, attain power, and realize their ambitions.
They learned to speak the language of democracy, gaining money and influence in the process and enlisting independent organizations to defend their rights and privileges.
On the other side, however, remains the vast population of powerless Iraqis, including widows and divorced or abandoned women with no one to provide for them and their children.
For these people, democracy and human rights mean nothing.
They are ignorant, poor, and sick.
Victimized by an educational system that collapsed over a decade ago, they have few skills that can help them find employment in Iraq's blighted economy.
During Saddam's reign, no effort was made to raise living standards for the poor.
I have visited the huge slums of Iraq and found families living in homes with barely a roof to cover them, with infestations of insects everywhere, and with raw sewage seeping under their doors.
Day or night, they live in darkness.
Needing nothing more than food, decent housing, and the possibility of a job, these families wait for death, dreading the cries of their starving children.
When I met the women who live in those houses, they showered me with questions: will democracy give us food and houses?
Will democracy stop men from beating their wives?
Will it give citizenship to our children?
Will it give us the right to divorce the husbands who abandon us?
My answer to all of these questions was "yes."
Yes, democracy will give you the right to live in a decent house, the right to learn and work, and it will give citizenship to your children and make you equal with your men.
But you have to work hard and make every possible effort in demanding your rights.
They replied: "Saddam taught us for 35 years how to be jobless, silent, and fearful.
What can we do now?"
In these destitute areas, where most Iraqis live, people are prey to bitter temptations.
Many are beyond the reach of political or government leaders.
They fall easily into violence, theft, and sabotage.
Poverty drives some to take money in exchange for acts of violence, abetted by the lure of a false heroism that they were not able to act upon during Saddam's long reign.
Poverty has exacerbated the trauma of Iraq's violent history of wars and atrocities, which has desensitized people to killing.
Though conditions in Iraq today are drawing many young men toward violence, I am convinced that we need only to provide decent jobs and housing to save them.
Jobs, in particular, will help young people to create new lives through serious work.
We must not use no-work jobs to disguise an army of unemployed.
We must give people jobs that allow them to make a contribution to rebuilding the country.
By nature, every individual seeks to prove himself as a useful person in his or her society.
But the culture that Saddam created convinced Iraqis that political connections are the only way to gain authority, money, and knowledge.
Overcoming such sentiments will take time and a vibrant economy, which means that a new Iraqi government must have limited power, allowing the private sector to grow while encouraging widespread understanding of democracy and human rights.
Religious groups are ready to contribute to this process.
We can also rehabilitate the technocrats who served under Saddam, so that they, too, have a chance to serve their country.
Last but not least, we must provide loans to poor families to help them build a respectable life.
Above all, the government must spare no effort in convincing poor Iraqis of the value of democracy and freedom, and how important the constitution is in realizing their aspirations for a better life.
This will not be easy to achieve in a country where many people consider breaking the law an act of heroism.
But we Iraqis have also learned that power should not be concentrated in a few hands, and that establishing justice requires fighting all forms of corruption.
If the constitution is to operate as the guarantee of democracy, freedom, and security, poor Iraqis must learn to make that fight their own.
The Islamist Identity
Everywhere you look nowadays, Islam is used (and misused) as a political force.
Some Muslims employ it as a call to action; many in the West (and elsewhere) perceive it as an "other" demanding containment and exclusion.
As a Turk, I feel both sides of this debate directly.
The reason that Islam seems like a religion of the "other" to Western eyes is that the West has witnessed a systematic de-institutionalization of religion.
It is not religion that disappeared from modern Western life, of course, but rather the claims that religious institutions can make on individual behavior.
Religion in the modern world is a much more personal and spiritual experience than ever before.
Yet a process of de-institutionalization of religious experience is also taking place within Islam.
Politicization of Islam is displacing the authority of Islam's religious classes, the ulema .
As in the West, Islamic religious experience is becoming more personal.
Interpretation of religious texts by individual Muslims, including political militants, intellectuals and women, is one result.
Another is the vulgarization of religious knowledge, with the Koran's teachings abused and taken out of context to support political ends.
Who now decides what is legitimate and what is illicit in Islam?
Who has the authority to interpret religious texts?
Who can issue a "fatwa" or declare "jihad"?
Nowadays, activism and terrorism provide, or rather impose, a new source of legitimacy.
So lay people decide what Islam does and does not mean, without the authority of religious schools and specialized training.
Indeed, Islam today is primarily interpreted through political actors and cultural movements, not religious institutions.
This de-institutionalization has enabled Islam to move from being a local and national social bond to forging imaginary ties between all Muslims, everywhere, who feel oppressed or displaced.
Thus, Islamism can unite adherents who previously were deeply divided: spiritual Sufi and canonized Shariat Muslims; Shia and Sunni Muslims; conservative Saudi Arabia and revolutionary Iran.
At the same time, Islam is on the move, with its believers leaving rural areas for cities, including the cities of the West.
Many see this movement as something negative, emphasizing the fact that these people are socially uprooted, which leads to alienation and, for some, to terrorism.
But social mobility is also a precondition for creating a modern outlook.
Of course, through migration Muslims experience a sense of distancing, if not an outright break, from their social origins.
So their religious experience is of a new kind, bereft of theological, community, or state institutions.
Religious experience instead becomes a form of social imagination within which they reconstruct a sense of belonging to Islam in new and strange surroundings.
It is not distance from modern life, but proximity to it that triggers a return to religious identity.
Indeed, most radicalism arises in groups who, by their experience of mobility and displacement, are acquainted with secular Western ways of political thinking and urban living.
Disoriented by unfamiliar surroundings, Islam becomes their anchor.
But for this anchor to work, Islam must be liberated from its traditionally subservient, passive and docile posture in the face of modernity.
By wearing a veil or beard, claiming the right for places to pray at work or school, and demanding special foods, Muslims identify themselves overtly as Muslims.
They are telling everyone around them that they are more zealous and meticulous in their religious observance than those who confine their religiosity to private life.
For example, non-Muslims usually see veiling as a sign of the debasement and inferiority of Muslim women.
From a stigma, however, it has become for Muslims a sign of their positive affirmation of an Islamic identity.
Young Muslim women in Europe illustrate this transformation perfectly.
Girls who adopt the headscarf in French and German schools are closer in many respects (namely youth culture, fashion consciousness, and language) to their classmates than to their homebound, uneducated mothers.
In adopting the headscarf for Europe's public sphere, these girls are unintentionally altering the symbol and the role of Muslim women.
This tendency extends deeper than headscarves.
All Western Muslims possess a double sense of belonging, a double cultural capital.
They define themselves through their religiosity, but they also have gained universal, secular knowledge.
Because they have a double cultural capital, they can circulate relatively freely between different activities and spaces--home, school, youth associations, and urban leisure space.
Being a Muslim and being an Islamist are not the same thing.
What we are witnessing today is a shift from a Muslim identity to an Islamist identity.
The religious self for individual Muslims is being shifted from the private to the public realm.
The question for everyone is whether that search for identity can be satisfied with headscarves and wide public acceptance of Islamic religious practice, or if positive affirmation of Islam demands a more fundamental renunciation of modernity.
A New Era for Islamic Science?
For a few hundred years, when science and mathematics were enjoying a period of great invention, one region of the world stood out.
Masters of these disciplines were revered there, medicine advanced quickly, and the average person was curious about how nature worked.
Not surprisingly, this region was globally respected.
In the other half of the known planet, scientists were punished, even killed.
Mathematics was outlawed as irreligious and alien, and was later made subservient to religion.
The standard of living was low.
The prosperous region was the Islamic Middle East, while an ignorant Europe remained poor.
Both regions were religiously governed (historians differ about the role and natures of the religions in this context), but science flourished only in one of them.
Now, of course the roles of the Islamic Middle East and the West are reversed.
Since World War II, the United States has been the world's undisputed leader in science.
Throughout this period, the brightest students were drawn away from their native lands, attracted by superior research universities and opportunities.
Until recently, more than half of all mathematics, science, and engineering graduate students in the US were foreign-born.
Many of these talents stayed after graduation, and both industry and government took advantage of this.
Meanwhile, Islamic cultures entered a historical phase in which science was equated with Western influence and eschewed.
Even in countries where oil revenues could fuel a significant amount of research, Arab rulers did not encourage such investment, with the result that their societies have not prospered as much as they might have.
Recently, a desire for greater political respect has spurred Islamic nations to invest in technology, which is most visible in Pakistani and Iranian nuclear ambitions.
But while such weapons carry political weight, the science behind them is mundane and old.
More meaningful is the respect that comes from incubating insights, rather than the products of past discoveries.
Imagine the influence that would be generated by a Pakistani institute that was the world leader in cancer research.
Would the political rhetoric shift if researchers in Oman discovered a key to suppressing AIDS?
This is one unclaimed opportunity.
But another exists, and not just for Islamic societies.
The US has made profound missteps recently.
"Matters of faith" have been substituted for science across government, from the president down.
Top researchers have had their reports changed by political operatives when the facts contradicted official belief.
Encouraged by a religiously influenced administration, school systems are shifting their focus from science to "values."
Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, entry visas are fewer and more difficult to obtain, stanching the flow of young talent into US universities.
Major scientific organizations have protested, without result.
At the same time, tax laws have been revised to make investors wealthier in the near term, discouraging long-term investment in research.
Half a trillion dollars was committed to the war in Iraq, an amount roughly equal to the sponsorship of all basic research for the last thousand years.
Even if the US avoids a fundamentalist dark age, it clearly risks losing its global research dominance.
Japan recognized the link between political clout and science in the 1980's.
Japan's chief industrialist, Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony, and the right-wing politician Shintaro Ishihara gave a series of speeches that were collected and published in 1986 as a book called The Japan that Can Say No .
They outlined a national strategy in which world influence was understood to flow from scientific leadership.
The key idea was that military power could be made obsolete if the "food chain" of military technologies was controlled by other nations.
The book's title refers to Japan's plan to "say no" to US military influence once Japan controlled key military technologies.
Building a knowledge-based economy using oil wealth is clearly possible.
For example, Texas, like most southern US states, was once economically poor and declining.
Although it had oil revenue, the flow of dollars into an economy, by itself, does not boost prosperity as much as one might think.
So Texas decided to devote its oil money to an educational endowment.
Today, that endowment is roughly equal to that of Harvard University and spread over 15 universities.
The effect has been staggering: aerospace manufacturing has almost disappeared from California, but is booming in Texas.
Telecom research centers and consortia have flocked to Texas, even from the Canadian telecommunications giant Nortel.
Although manufacturing in the US is in crisis, Texas has one of the strongest manufacturing economies in the world.
There is no reason that the same outcome could not be achieved in the Middle East.
First, however, the Islamic world must rediscover and embrace its proud heritage.
Iran's Debate Over Iraq
No country in the Middle East is monitoring postwar events in Iraq more closely than Iran.
Geographical proximity, an intense and bloody history of conflict with Saddam Hussein's Iraq, religious and emotional connections to Shi'a Iraq, and concerns about the United States and its policies in the region are all threads that tie Iran to its western neighbor.
Given ongoing tensions with America, Iran is particularly concerned with the likelihood of a continuing US presence next door, as well as with America's dominant role in shaping Iraq's post-Saddam future.
Outsiders may find it difficult to follow internal Iranian debates, but they do exist, and they are intense, even if they are not always visible to the wider international public.
Three general approaches are recognizable in the evolving Iranian debate on post-Saddam Iraq.
Iranian pragmatists argue that Iran must inevitably cooperate with the US in post-Saddam Iraq, if only to ensure the rights of Iraq's Shi'a population.
For this reason, Iran should win assurances that a new leadership in Iraq will not be hostile to it, and will seek friendly bilateral relations.
Other vital considerations for the pragmatists include preserving Iraq's territorial integrity and repatriation of tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees living in Iran.
These moderates think that Iran's government should press America for extradition of Iraq-based members of the Mujahdin-e Khalq Organization (MKO), as well as its total dismantling.
In exchange, Iran's government should give its support to ensuring peace, stability, and security in Iraq.
In sum, the pragmatists would limit Iranian-American dealings, keeping them focused on an agenda that largely reflects Iran's domestic concerns.
By and large, conservative forces in Iran support this approach.
Another approach envisions a more active, cooperative Iranian role in reconstructing Iraq.
Advocates of this view argue that Iran is well positioned to make rebuilding easier, owing to its well-established infrastructure of personal and institutional ties in Iraq.
Eventually, it is argued, the US and the international community will recognize the value of Iranian cooperation.
Iranian cooperation should be repaid with the dismantling of the MKO infrastructure in Iraq, perhaps linked to an Iranian commitment to crack down further on any al-Qaida activities, as well as expel al-Qaida members from Iran.
Most importantly, Iran ought to press for an American assurance that its cooperation will be reciprocated by an American guarantee that Iran will not be a target of American military action in the future.
In short, advocates of cooperation call for an open and explicit bargain: Iran's support for stability during the current transitional phase in Iraq, as well as its commitment to maintain cooperative relations with whatever permanent government emerges in Iraq, in exchange for an improvement in Iran's regional and international position.
This view is widely held among Iran's reformers--both inside and outside government--and the more internationally minded technocratic and business class.
Finally, for Iran's radicals, the possibility of cooperative relations with the US is pure fantasy.
They believe that America is bent on undermining Iran's security and compromising its national interests.
In the radicals' view, the US will at the very least seek to dictate major changes in Iranian foreign policy.
At most, they argue, America will actively push for regime change in Iran.
It will actively work against Iran's acquisition of nuclear knowledge and energy, and may yet attempt to weaken Iran's military capability altogether.
These radicals view the US invasion of Iraq as reflecting America's desire to encircle Iran.
In response, they believe that Iran must be aggressive in defending its interests, forming strategic alliances with Russia and other regional powers, and using Iran's influence in Iraq to prevent a pro-American, anti-Iran government from emerging in Baghdad.
Hardliners of all factions support this approach.
Overthrowing Saddam's regime was the easy part of the Iraqi crisis.
Now comes the hard part: establishing peace and security, winning the war on terrorism, and convincing the Muslim masses that America is not intent on occupying Iraq, siphoning off its oil, and reshaping the Middle East in its image.
In the meantime, opposition to the US, expressed as suicide bombing and other forms of terrorism, will very likely increase.
Iran is destined to remain a major regional player because its political dynamism and Muslim identity resonate widely in the Muslim world.
What happens in Iraq has major implications for Iran, and the US is well advised to find ways of recognizing this fact.
American threats, or talk of another war, fuel the fires of resentment and frustration in Iran, strengthening the most radical forces.
If the US wishes to avoid this outcome, it must consider limiting the influence of its own radicals, recognizing that America's interests in Iraq are best served by greater cooperation with Iran.
The Way Out of Iraq
At last the point has been reached in Iraq where everyone ostensibly wants the same thing: the departure of Coalition forces from the country.
The recent leak from Britain's Ministry of Defense of a discussion paper on troop withdrawal highlights this desire.
The only question is how to satisfy it.
As long as the Coalition forces stay, violence is likely to escalate.
But if they leave, it will also escalate, only faster.
So the real question is how to get to the point where Iraq has a police force and army that can be trusted to maintain law as well as order.
Much ground must be covered to get anywhere close.
Notwithstanding the courage of the many Iraqis who join either the army or the police, no one should be surprised if some have motives that are less than pure.
In northern Iraq, old scores are being settled and de facto ethnic segregation is being introduced in areas, such as Irbil, that were traditionally diverse.
In other areas, sharia law is being introduced by force.
So how can Iraq create uniformed services that can be trusted to enforce the law effectively and impartially, without consideration of ethnicity, religion and gender?
The traditional answer is to recruit, train, and instill the "right values."
But there is not enough time for that.
Other ways are needed.
In the absence of a deeply instilled value system, Iraq needs grassroots civil society organizations that will hold police and army to account.
These could take different forms, but what is important is that they are truly inclusive at a local level, and that they get support from district, regional, and national power structures when they highlight abuses.
If there is local scrutiny, and national reinforcement and recognition of the value of that scrutiny, then most members of the uniformed forces are likely to behave appropriately -- and can be more easily identified and dealt with if they don't.
This might appear excessively hopeful, yet in Afghanistan, a country akin to Iraq in many ways, there are groups working towards this goal.
The Cooperation for Peace and Unity (CPAU) provides a model of how this can be done.
In Afghanistan, as in Iraq, ordinary people's highest priority has been to achieve a reduction in violence.
CPAU worked across the country in the last three years to set up District level Peace Committees, supported by satellite Peace Councils in villages.
The initiative faces a culture in which violence is so deeply embedded that children once learned arithmetic by counting numbers of dead Soviet soldiers.
The Committees therefore seek to bring together all sections of the community -- including teachers, tribal leaders, religious leaders, women, police, soldiers, judges, and businesspeople -- to develop ways of resolving conflicts non-violently.
Although monitoring has not been a formal part of the role of the committees until now (it is planned for the future), the mere fact that the police, army, and judiciary are part of these committees brings them into contact with the rest of the community, provides feedback, and starts to build trust.
Some results are remarkable.
In one workshop, the local military commander came for a couple of hours, as a courtesy, and ended up staying for the whole week.
At the end, he apologized for his violent past and made a commitment to disarm his 2,000-strong private army.
He now visits the Committee offices regularly.
In Iraq, projects such as the Humanitarian Liaison Center in Kirkuk are starting to fulfill a monitoring function by offering the ethnically diverse local population the opportunity to bring grievances and get help in having them resolved.
But, too often, even if a court ruling is made, it is not enforced as a result of intimidation.
Much good work on strengthening civil society has already been done by American and British forces.
We don't hear about the workshops for women's empowerment, or the successful organization of small-scale local elections across the country.  
But mobilizing civil society is hugely challenging, particularly when, as in Iraq, it needs to be done quickly and on a large scale.
Military force is still necessary, but so are incentives to disarm, including the prospect of economic opportunities that are more fruitful than crime and extortion.
Fortunately, building the capacity of civil society is as cheap as it is important.
The Humanitarian Liaison Center serves the whole of Kirkuk at an annual cost of just $75,000 a year.
With $10 million, such centers could be replicated 100 times -- with plenty of change left over.
The challenge is to commit to this approach, to scale up and to support to the hilt the brave people who take on the challenge of holding power to account.
Otherwise, the Iraqi people are unlikely to get the security that, after so many years of suffering, they so desperately need.
Democracy on the Nile?
The surprise decision by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to propose a constitutional amendment that would allow direct and competitive presidential elections may be a giant step for democracy in Egypt and the Arab World.
Westerners used to pluralistic democracy may find it hard to understand what a potentially huge shift this will be in a country accustomed to military rule for over 50 years.
Under the current system, Egyptian citizens can only show up on the day of a presidential referendum every six years and say yes or no to the single name that appears on the presidential ballot.
This explains why someone like Mubarak always received over 90% of the vote, albeit amid indifferent turnout.
Syrian and Iraqi strongmen have done even better with this system, no doubt because they demanded that the names and addresses of voters be put at the bottom of each ballot.
Many people have long argued that democratization in the Middle East will not get far until Egypt becomes fully engaged in the process.
Egypt could not truly set out on a path of democratization without first amending its constitution -- to downsize the Pharaonic powers of its president and set limits on his term in office.
Mubarak, after all, is already in his 24th year as president.
So the announcement that he wants competitive presidential elections is an important first step.
The regime may assume that it will be able to use the process to its own advantage, but events may not be that easy to control once people begin to feel empowered.
The democratic genie is out of the bottle.
In any case, Egypt is not the only country in this troubled region that is now embarking on the road of democracy.
Turkey at one end of the Middle East and Morocco at the other are already well on their way.
The real groundswell this time seems to have come from the close timing and positive outcomes of recent elections in Iraq, Palestine, and to a lesser degree in Saudi Arabia.
The unprecedented demonstrations against Syria's occupation of Lebanon following the assassination of its former prime minister, Rafiq al-Hariri, show no signs of abating.
Egyptian opposition groups, too, have staged increasingly bold marches and other forms of civil disobedience in the last few weeks.
The catalyst for their anger was the arrest and detention of the ailing opposition leader Ayman Nour at the end of January.
The government's heavy-handed behavior reinvigorated the homegrown "Kifaya" (Enough) movement, which has demanded an end to the Mubarak regime.
Suddenly the popular wisdom that Egyptians are passive and afraid to act did not seem to be holding up.
An alliance of local, regional, and international forces is uniting against tyranny-as-usual on the banks of the Nile.
The recent wave of popular pressure appears to have shaken the regime.
Only a month ago, Mubarak dismissed demands for constitutional reform as "futile."
But, whatever combination of events brought about his change of heart, election initiative should be welcomed.
It is a necessary -- but insufficient -- first step for overhauling Egypt's stagnant political system.
Egyptians are already wary of token reforms à la Tunisia, where longstanding President Zine El Abidin Bin Ali created a caricature of a constitutional amendment that appeared to open the door for competitive presidential elections, but then staged a sham contest with a few handpicked "opponents."
In previous Tunisian presidential referenda, Bin Ali routinely received 99% of the vote; he now got 96%.
Let us hope that Mubarak is more serious about electoral reform.
As a measure of sincerity, he needs to order the immediate release of Ayman Nour and take steps to terminate the 24-year-long state of emergency, which effectively prevents political campaigning from taking place.
Mubarak should also endorse a limit of no more than two successive five-year terms for any president.
Equally necessary are confidence-building measures, including open and equal access to the media, which are now state-controlled.
I have announced that I intend to contest this upcoming presidential election as a way of opening debate on these essential reforms.
But I would gladly go back to my life as a private citizen once guaranteed a free and open election this fall.
If seriously implemented, these steps will transform Mubarak's legacy.
Along with events in Lebanon, Iraq, and Palestine, it may well usher in an Arab spring of freedom, one long overdue.
Historic Election in Egypt?
Egyptians go to the polls on September 7th to elect a president from among ten contenders, including the incumbent of 24 years, Hosni Mubarak.
While few doubt the outcome will be his re-election, many are intensely following the process.
Some 6000 domestic election monitors have been training for the event, while hundreds of foreign reporters are converging on the country this week.
Although all the formal trappings of a true electoral contest are in place, important aspects of authenticity are glaringly absent.
Despite promises to the contrary, this is far from a level playing field.
Mubarak still commands disproportionate assets: name recognition, a virtual monopoly on state-controlled electronic media and some 85% of the print media.
One week before the poll, some opposition candidates have yet to air even one campaign ad on Egyptian television.
All members of the presidential election commission are Mubarak appointees, and the new election rules eliminated any independent challengers.
Since the year 2000, Egypt's 8000 judges must supervise and certify election results, by ruling of the High Court.
This was a major step toward fairer elections, as the judges' professional union has remained fairly independent over the past half-century of executive power grabs.
So the Mubarak regime has had to use various ploys to neutralize the judge's union.
One was to stretch the definition of ‘the judiciary' to include thousands of loyal government employees who have law degrees but no experience on the bench.  This boxes in the true judges, for if they protest by boycotting their supervisory duties, the task will fall once more to police from the infamous Ministry of the Interior.
Thus, in the past, the judges' union tended to go along, with predictable results.
In the 2000 parliamentary elections, while Mubarak's ruling party received roughly 38% of the popular vote in districts supervised by true judges, that percent somehow jumped to 86% where the quasi-judges were in charge.
This year promises to be very different.
In the spring the judges held a nation-wide assembly and resolved that unless the regime granted them full independence, and exclusive oversight of the voting process they would not supervise the upcoming presidential (or parliamentary) races.
On September 2nd they made their final demands: allow civil society groups to observe the voting process, stop interfering in the definition of legitimate judges for purposes of the election, and agree that no ballot box will leave the presence of a legitimate judge until its contents are counted, certified and reported.
Thus far, a standoff looks likely, as the head of the presidential election commission has stated publicly on Egyptian television that he refuses all citizen monitoring of the election process.  
Other interesting developments on the eve of the election include a fierce public debate over whether to vote or to boycott the presidential race.
Several opposition parties have called on their members to stay away in protest over restrictive election rules that strongly favor Mubarak.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood, thought to be the single strongest opposition group in Egypt, are urging their followers to caste ballots and vote their conscience but not to give support to any ‘despotic, corrupt rulers.'
This is a clear if implicit repudiation of Mubarak, the sole ruler for 24 years.
Some 34 civil society organizations are preparing thousands of young Egyptians to monitor the elections despite repeated governmental objections.
These groups argue that if the regime is not planning to rig the vote, then domestic as well as foreign observation of the polling process should not be a problem.
The regime response is to say that any outside monitoring is an infringement on Egyptian sovereignty, and that domestic monitors are an affront to the integrity of the judges.
That argument was quickly undermined when the judges' union announced their support for civil society monitors.
Whether the Mubarak regime is running scared because of the mounting challenges from within and without to hold a free and fair election, or is simply incapable of ridding the party of cheating as a way of life, the present signs do not bode well for next Wednesday's polls.
Meanwhile, Egyptians for the first time are experiencing the thrilling taste of defying tyranny, and enjoying some newly-found space for freedom.     
Europe's Dollar Envy
Currencies can become the focus not just for commercial transactions, but for diplomatic and political wrangles.
When this happens, commercial transactions become more difficult and subject to greater uncertainty.
The politicization of money during the interwar depression was economically devastating.
But there have been more recent occurrences of nasty currency wars.
In the 1960's the international monetary order became the focus of a political tug-of-war.
Each side had quite different theories and explanations of what was going on.
The Europeans--in particular the French--complained about what General Charles de Gaulle termed the "exorbitant privilege" of the US dollar.
The General and his monetary guru, Jacques Rueff, argued that the US used the dollar's status as the major reserve currency of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange-rate regime in order to run deficits and pay for its overseas military adventurism (at that time in Vietnam).
France responded with calls for monetary reform that would end the peculiar role of the dollar and tried to revive the largely discredited gold standard.
Europeans began a long discussion of the advantages of monetary union, achievement of which would allow them to look the dollar in the face.
But from the American point of view, the international role of the dollar was a trap.
Other countries could change their exchange rates, and in this way could maintain greater export competitiveness.
The US government was powerless in the face of an undervalued yen, fueling the belief that the rest of the world was using the dollar to attack America's manufacturing base.
The Nixon administration came to the conclusion that the only way to save the American economy was to engage in monetary unilateralism--a monetary expansion so dramatic that other countries would be forced into adjusting their exchange rates.
These long-forgotten battles seem suddenly very immediate once again.
The world no longer has a fixed exchange-rate regime, but the dollar remains the major reserve currency--a sort of floating Bretton Woods.
For Americans the reserve role of the dollar is a potential threat, while for non-Americans it is yet another instance of an American neo-imperial quest for hegemony.
In this decade, China has taken the place of 1960's Japan, holding its exchange rate down in order to push export growth.
Consequently it is the target of US complaints about unfair competition, and of efforts to force an exchange-rate adjustment that would deter Americans from buying Chinese toys, appliances, and clothing.
Manufacturers in the US have decided that Chinese-made bras constitute a threat to the American way of life.
Meanwhile, Europeans (especially the French) complain about the big US deficits, and de Gaulle's argument that the rest of the world is paying for America's wars is in fashion again.
Some Europeans suggest that Asian central banks should hold a greater part of their reserves in euros, an echo of the General's unsuccessful attempt to force America to its knees by selling dollars for gold.
The 1960's ended in the breakdown of the "system," and in major financial turbulence, accompanied by an inflationary surge of commodity prices.
Everyone was hurt, and America's role in world affairs was shaken.
A similar collapse now is likely to have a rather different effect.
The floating-rate system of today is stronger and the costs of adjustment differently distributed.
Most Americans do not suffer greatly from the dollar's sharp fall, as foreign sellers have to make price adjustments for the US market.
Asian economies are growing vigorously, and their central banks are building up claims on the US.
They are likely to continue this policy, as the alternative would be a sudden setback to the competitiveness of their export sectors in the all-important US market.
This gives the US a longer time to address a current account deficit that is in the long run unsustainable.
The economically dynamic regions of the world--North America and Asia--are thus linked together in a pact that will ensure the continued centrality of the American dollar.
Americans will continue to pile up debt because Asians want them to do that.
To abrogate the pact would be against the interest of both parties.
This is not American unilateralism, because it means working with Asia.
But to Europeans, who are excluded from the pact, it looks like monetary and economic unilateralism.
In the meantime, the rise of the euro against the dollar creates substantial European pain for manufacturing exporters.
Europe, however, is unable to do much to gain relief.
Indeed, Europe will be the major sufferer in the new currency clashes.
Answers that were touted in the 1960's--revival of the gold standard, or the invention of a common European currency--do not appear to be very helpful any more.
Having a single currency has turned out not to afford substantial protection.
The old version of the European response--what psychologists might call "dollar envy"--will only become more acute.
There will be appeals to the European Central Bank to expand the monetary base, as if imitating the dollar were the answer to all the industrial, structural, and demographic problems plaguing Europe.
But a moment's reflection should remind us that Europe's problems are not amenable to currency manipulation.
Protesting the new version of America's exorbitant monetary privilege should be seen for what it is: a way of compensating for a real European powerlessness.
So dollar envy is here to stay, and it will become even greater as the greenback's international value melts away without any obviously bad effects on the people who print and use it.
An Epidemic of Politics
Americans, like citizens in countries throughout the world, have come to accept that politics plays an important role in the appointment of certain kinds of public officials.
Few of us are surprised (though some may be disappointed) when a federal judgeship is awarded or a senior diplomat appointed because the candidate passes a litmus test of loyalty to some principle that is important to the President's or Prime Minister's party.
But science, almost everyone agrees, is different, and here the United States is beginning to stand as a cautionary example to the rest of the world.
Scientific appointments should rest on objective criteria of training, ability, and performance.
Clearly, it is legitimate to interrogate a future Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) about his views on abortion.
But it is entirely out of place when appointees to scientific advisory committees are subjected to tests of political loyalty.
Similarly, membership of bodies that conduct peer review of scientific proposals - a process that is fundamental to scientific progress - surely ought to be free of all barriers to entry that are unrelated to professional qualifications.
Unfortunately, scientists in the US are running up against such barriers more and more often.
During the past fall, the journal Science published several news stories related to the issue.
One involved the wholesale replacement of members of the advisory committee to the National Center for Environmental Health, a part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), without consulting the center's director.
Similar cases involved the CDC's Advisory Committee on Lead Poisoning and Prevention, the Advisory Committee on National Human Research Protections, and the Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing.
The current epidemic of ideology, in which advisory committees are shut down and reassembled with new members, and candidates are subjected to loyalty tests, seems old hat to some observers.
Officials at the HHS call it "fairly standard practice."
Well, it isn't standard practice in America - or at least it wasn't.
In any case, what's really worrisome is not that the Bush administration examines candidates for compatibility with its "values."
The most alarming development is how deep the ideological vetting now cuts, invading areas that once were immune to this kind of manipulation.
Indeed, perhaps the most telling case in the widening political epidemic was a membership re-shuffle of the study section at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health that evaluates grants for studying workplace injuries.
Advisory committees might have been vulnerable to occasional stacking of this kind in the past.
After all, they recommend the policies that politicians may or may not want to consider.
But study sections?
In October 2002, Science published an editorial by David Michaels and a group of colleagues.
Several were distinguished former public servants who had been involved with some of the committees in question, and they brought a valuable perspective to the issue, one based on their personal experience.
Their piece was a story in itself, but what followed was even more interesting.
It set off a volley of letters in which scientists told of similar experiences.
A nominee for the National Institutes of Health's Muscular Dystrophy Research Coordinating Committee told of being vetted by a White House staff member.
After being asked about her views on various Bush administration policies, none of them related to the work of the committee, she was asked whether she supports the president's policy on embryonic stem cells.
Another letter writer, a distinguished professor of psychiatry and psychology, reported receiving a call from the White House about his nomination to serve on the National Council on Drug Abuse.
The caller declared that he must vet him to "determine whether he held any views that might be embarrassing to the president."
According to the professor, a series of questions followed, with the White House official keeping a running score.
One example: "You're two for three; the president opposes needle exchange (for intravenous drug users) on moral grounds, regardless of the outcome."
Then the exchange took an even more chilling turn.
The official asked the nominee whether he had voted for Bush, and, on being informed that he had not, asked: "Why didn't you support the president?"
This is the stuff of dictatorship, not democracy.
The purpose of scientific advisory committees is to provide balanced, thoughtful advice to the policy process.
Nothing is gained - and much is lost - when a desired policy outcome is put first.
This is why deciding which research projects to support has always been a matter for objective peer review, not politicians.
In fact, the applicable statute for all this - the Federal Advisory Committee Act - specifically requires that committees be balanced and "not inappropriately influenced by the appointing authority."
US Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson and the White House Personnel Office ought to set an example to the rest of the world.
They can do so very easily: by following the law.
A Murder in Moscow
It is time to end the fiction that Vladimir Putin's "dictatorship of law" has made postcommunist Russia any less lawless.
The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, one of Russia's bravest and best journalists, a woman who dared to expose the brutal murders committed by Russian troops in Chechnya, is final proof that President Putin has delivered nothing more than a run of the mill dictatorship with the usual contempt for law.
This recognition is a timely one for the world to make, particularly Europe.
Germany's Foreign Ministry is preparing a policy on Russian/German relations that will enshrine indifference to Putin's lawlessness as being in the national interest of the most powerful member of the European Union.
But indifference becomes appeasement when it encourages Putin to pursue his lawless ways in the international arena, as in his current campaign to strangle Georgia's economy.
The killing of Politkovskaya has incited an eerie sense of déjà vu : just as in the KGB's heyday, people simply disappear in Putin's Russia.
Politkovskaya's is the third politically tinged killing in three weeks.
Enver Ziganshin, the chief engineer of BP Russia, was shot to death in Irkutsk on September 30.
Andrei Kozlov, the deputy governor of Russia's central bank who was leading a campaign against financial fraud, was assassinated on September 14.
The fact that Russia's Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, took over the investigation into Politkovskaya's killing, as he did with the murder of Kozlov, doesn't inspire hope, as such senior level involvement would in any real democracy.
In fact, the involvement of the highest level of Russia's government is almost a guarantee that the killers will never be found.
Politkovskaya's murder is a particularly grim augury when you consider that she was a powerful critic of Russia's President.
In her articles for one of the few remaining independent papers in Moscow, Novaya Gazeta, and in her books "Putin's Russia: Life in a Failing Democracy" and "A Dirty War: A Russian Reporter in Chechnya," Politkovskaya wrote of the vanishing freedoms that are the signature characteristic of Putin's presidency.
As shown by the exile of the former media tycoons Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinky, and the imprisonment of oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, three fates await Putin's enemies: exile, imprisonment, or the grave.
I am not accusing Putin's government of the contract killing of Politkovskaya.
After all, as a campaigning investigative journalist she made many people angry besides Putin, not least of which is the current Chechen Prime Minister, Ramzan Kadyrov, whom she accused of a policy of kidnapping for ransom.
But even if Vladimir Putin's associates had nothing to do with Politkovskaya being gunned down in an elevator of her apartment building in the center of Moscow, his contempt for law created the climate in which the murder was carried out.
Like the murder of Archbishop Thomas Beckett in his Canterbury Cathedral many centuries ago, the crime was committed in the clear belief that it would please the king.
Given what Politkovskaya represented—the responsibility of a democratic press to question the Kremlin and its policies—the government should have made certain that nothing bad happened to her.
Putin's Russia has already lost 12 leading journalists to murder in the past six years.
None of those crimes has been solved, which would not be the case if Putin's "dictatorship of law" was anything more than a PR strategy.
The six year period since Vladimir Putin arrived in the Kremlin has been a time of deeply conflicting signals.
On one hand, the world sees a young, educated leader pledging to modernize Russia, particularly in terms of bringing its law enforcement and judicial practices into line with international norms.
On the other, the president watches in silence while his ex-colleagues in Russia's FSB security service (the former KGB) provide no security to those murdered, and launch a series of notorious espionage cases against journalists, scientists, and environmental activists.
These "neo-spies" include journalist Gregory Pasko, arms control expert Igor Sutyagin, diplomat Valentin Moiseyev, physicist Valentin Danilov, and others.
The supposedly civilizing influence of being a Western partner — chairing a G-8 summit in Saint Petersburg for example — seems to have been lost on Putin's Kremlin cabal.
Once again exposure to Western values has delivered another Potemkin Village; Russia presents a façade of laws and democratic institutions, but behind that cardboard surface the same arbitrary brutes rule.
The danger for the world is that Putin's lawlessness is being exported.
Across Russia's near abroad, a form of criminalized diplomacy is taking root.
Look at Putin's attempt to rig Ukraine's previous presidential election, and the on again off again criminal charges brought against the opposition leader Yuliya Tymoshenko.
Look at the rogue breakaway regions in Moldova and Georgia that exist only because of the Kremlin's backing.
Look at how the Kremlin seeks to blackmail its neighbors by threatening their energy supplies.
Every policeman knows that when you ignore criminal behavior, criminals grow bolder.
It is past time for the world to recognize Vladimir Putin for what he is: a man who is taking Russia back into the shadows.
So the world must now ponder that old Latin maxim qui tacet consentere videtur -- silence means consent -- and ask itself if it is wise to quietly consent to Putin's construction of a lawless energy superpower.
Russia's Pipeline to Empire
Gerhard Schroeder, who less than a month ago was Germany's Chancellor, has agreed to become chairman of the company that is building a gas pipeline from Russia, across the Baltic Sea to Germany, and on through Western Europe.
In many countries, Schroeder would now be charged with the crime of conflict of interest.
His apparent ethical lapse is magnified by the fact that, at this very moment, Russia is threatening to cut off Ukraine's gas supplies if that country does not give in to the pricing demands of Kremlin's state-owned gas behemoth, Gazprom.
Russia's strategic task is obvious: cutting off Ukraine's gas currently means cutting off much of Europe's gas as well, because some of its biggest gas pipelines pass through Ukraine.
By circumventing Ukraine, Poland, and of course, the Baltic countries, the new pipeline promises greater leverage to the Kremlin as it seeks to reassert itself regionally.
President Vladimir Putin and his administration of ex-KGB clones will no longer have to worry about Western Europe when deciding how hard to squeeze Russia's postcommunist neighbors.
Should Europe really be providing Putin with this new imperial weapon?
Worse, might Russia turn this weapon on an energy-addicted EU?
That a German ex-chancellor is going to lead the company that could provide Russia with a means to manipulate the EU economy is testimony to Europe's dangerous complacency in the face of Putin's neo-imperialist ambitions.
Certainly Russia's media are aware of Europe's growing dependence on Russian energy.
Indeed, they revel in it: after we integrate and increase our common gas business, Russian editorialists write, Europe will keep silent about human rights.
Putin expresses this stance in a more oblique way with his commitment to pursuing what he calls an "independent policy."
What he means by that is that Russia is to be "independent" of the moral and human rights concerns of the Western democracies.
Perhaps some European leaders really do believe that maintaining the Union's cozy prosperity justifies silencing ourselves on human rights and other issues that annoy the Kremlin.
Of course, we may speak up, briefly, about "commercial" matters like the expropriation of Yukos, but if the Kremlin puts a price on our values or criticism of Russian wrongdoing -- as in, say, bloodstained Chechnya -- Europeans seem willing to shut up rather than face the possibility of higher energy prices, or even a blockade like that now facing Ukraine.
As Putin shuffles his court, subordinating the Duma to his will, the EU's hopes for a growing "Europeanization" of Russia should be abandoned.
The Russia that Putin is building has mutated from the post-Soviet hopes of freedom into an oil and gas bulwark for his new model ex-KGB elite.
Indeed, Matthias Warnig, the chief executive of the pipeline consortium that Schroeder will chair, is a longtime Putin friend.
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that Warnig, who heads Dresdner Bank's Russian arm, was an officer in the Stasi, the East German secret police, and met Putin in the late 1980's when the Russian president was based in East Germany as a KGB spy.
That Russians tolerate a government of ex-KGB men, for whom lack of compassion and intolerance of dissent are the norm, reflects their exhaustion from the tumult of the last 20 years.
Now the Kremlin seems to think that what is good for ordinary Russians is good for independent nations as well: small and weak countries will be shown no mercy once Russia is given the tools to intimidate, isolate, and threaten them with the prospect of an energy blockade.
As a former Head of State of newly independent Lithuania, I frequently endured such threats.
The EU has signed numerous agreements with Russia including one for a "common space" for freedom and justice.
The Kremlin is very good at feigning such idealism.
Its control of Eastern Europe was always enforced on the basis of "friendship treaties," and the Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 were "fraternal" missions.
But look how Putin abuses that "common" space: barbaric treatment of Chechens, the businessmen Mikhail Khodorkovsky imprisoned, foreign NGO's hounded, a co-leader of last year's Orange Revolution, Yuliya Tymoshenko, indicted by Russian military prosecutors on trumped-up charges.
If Europeans are serious about their common space for human rights and freedoms, they must recognize that those values are not shared by the calculating placemen of Putin's Kremlin.
The same is true of viewing Russia as an ally in the fight against terrorism.
Is it really conceivable that the homeland of the "Red Terror" with countless unpunished crimes from the Soviet era, and which bears traces of blood from Lithuania to the Caucasus, will provide reliable help in stopping Iran and North Korea from threatening the world?
It seems more likely that the Kremlin's cold minds will merely exploit each crisis as an opportunity to increase their destructive power and influence.
For decades, my region of Europe was left to the mercy of evil.
So I cannot sit back in silence as Europe stumbles blindly into a new appeasement.
We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe, have been taught by our legacy that behind Russia's every diplomatic act lurks imperial ambition.
Western Europeans, who have been spared this legacy, should heed our warnings.
Dependence on Russia -- even if its face is now that of the allegedly "charismatic" Gerhard Schroeder -- will only lead to an abyss.
Iraq's Bullets and Ballots
When the Iraq war started in 2003, the Bush administration had very ambitious plans: as in post-1945 Germany and Japan, a long and peaceful occupation was envisaged, during which expanding oil production would assure rising prosperity as democratic structures were built piece by piece.
The foundation was to be a liberal, even post-modern constitution, complete with a guarantee of 25% of parliamentary seats for women. 
In today's Iraq, there is no peace and no prosperity.
The constitution that will be voted on October 15th includes that 25% rule, but otherwise is far from liberal.
The key provision (article 2) that no law may contradict "the undisputed rules of Islam" violates the basic principle of parliamentary sovereignty, and will prevent legislation from meeting international standards.
For example, the age of sexual consent for girls cannot be set above nine, because Muhhamad himself had a nine-year-old wife.
It follows that nine-year-old girls are also adults in criminal law, and subject to capital punishment for, say, converting to another religion.
More broadly, the Shias can use this provision to place their ayatollahs over the elected parliament, as in Iran, because they alone are authorized to determine the "rules" of Islam.
Outsiders and the few Iraqi liberals worry mainly about this Islamic provision, but the widespread Sunni opposition to the constitution is aimed at other provisions: the exclusion of the "Saddamist Ba'ath Party" from political life and government, and the federalist provisions that grant autonomy to the 18 Iraqi provinces and allow them to combine into regional governments.
The exclusion rule is a personal issue for elite Sunnis -- including thousands of businessmen, professionals, even artists -- because, with few exceptions, they were all Ba'ath members.
In theory, the constitutional prohibition could be interpreted as applying only to the future.
But in practice administrative rules are now being applied to exclude so-called "high-ranking" Ba'ath members from any form of government employment, and thousands are affected.
The Sunnis would probably accept the federalist provisions if they applied only to the Kurds.
They know that the alternative is not a return to centralism, but secession by the three Kurdish-majority provinces of Dahuk, Arbil, and As Sulaymaniyah to form an independent Kurdistan, with its own treasury, army (the Pesh Merga), and oil production around Kirkuk -- the second-largest reserves in Iraq.
Sunnis reject the same federalism for the Shias because they view them as fellow Arabs who have always accepted Sunni rule in the past, and will do so again -- unless they have their own government.
That is what the new constitution would allow, because the Shia-majority provinces in the south -- which contain the greater part of Iraq's oil reserves -- could form their own regional government.
In the usual style of the Middle East, disappointed Sunni leaders, unhappy with the constitution, now threaten violence.
But federalism is not the reason why Sunni supremacists and Islamists launch deadly attacks.
Their opposition is more elemental: they do not accept the principle of democratic majority rule.
Instead, they seek to restore Sunni minority rule.
For the Islamists, all Shias deserve death anyway, as apostates.
One Shia leader, Moqtada Sadr, also vehemently opposes federalism.
His followers are the largely illiterate, poorest, and most violent Shias of the slums of Baghdad and beyond, whose "Mahdi militia" fought American troops in 2004, even while the Americans were protecting Shias from Sunni attackers.
As a very junior priest who derives his authority from his dead Ayatollah father -- himself a populist -- Sadr is opposed by Iraq's living Ayatollahs, who despise his ignorance and violence.
Sadr cannot possibly compete with them in religious authority, so he takes an Arab-nationalist stance against them, often recalling that the highest Shia cleric, Ayatollah Sistani, is a Persian, not an Arab.
Similarly, he reminds his followers that the El Hakims, who head the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), and their "Badr" militia were subsidized exiles in Iran -- many fighting for Iran in the long and bitter Iran-Iraq war -- until the Americans "brought them back." 
Sadr opposes federalism because a Shia regional government would obey his enemies, Sistani and the SCIRI, and, he says, fall under Iranian influence.
To underline his message, Sadr sent his men to attack the Badr militia, succeeding in Baghdad, where the Mahdis are numerous, but failing in Najaf, where Sadr is hated after the destruction caused last year -- until his men were massacred by the Americans.
It was bad enough to deal with Sadr as a bandit; simple political arithmetic now dictates that he will likely be the central figure deciding the outcome of October's vote on the constitution.
To reject the constitution and force new elections for a constitutional assembly, opponents need a two-thirds majority in at least three provinces.
The Sunnis are only likely to win in two provinces, but if Sadr orders his followers in Baghdad's slums to vote "no" alongside local Sunnis, that would probably flip the capital to the constitution's opponents, ensuring its defeat.
As a political thug, Sadr is, of course, willing to be bought.
Last year he was wanted for murder.
Now he wants recognition as a statesman, money, and, at least implicitly, Sistani's and the SCIRI's humiliation.
He might receive offers, and perhaps the bargaining has already started.
But some of the Shias whom he attacks with words and bullets have thousands under arms, and think that he should be offered only bullets.
The Secret Policeman's Fall
As Hungary's Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany found out when a recorded admission that his government was lying incited riots, openness in government doesn't come easily in Eastern Europe's new democracies.
Like Hungary, post-communist Romania has struggled to increase transparency and honesty in what was once one of the world's most closed societies.
As we struggled, continued secrecy allowed an explosion of corruption and abuse of office.
But there has, at last, been real movement towards openness -- progress recognized by the European Union when it gave Romania the green light to join the European Union at the beginning of 2007.
Aside from achieving what the EU now deems a "functioning market economy," key political and legal changes, which I have overseen as Minister of Justice, range from increased transparency and control in the funding of political parties to a shakeup of the judiciary.
Judicial reforms are, in turn, helping to root out corruption.
Indictments have been issued against former and current cabinet ministers, members of parliament, judges, prosecutors, lawyers, police and customs officers, and other public officials, as well as directors of private companies.
In addition, new standardized forms have been introduced for declarations of assets and financial interests by anyone who holds an official position in government, parliament, public and local administration, and the judicial system.
The new declarations are the most detailed in Europe, and, more importantly, they are published.
Romania's progress is confirmed in a report released earlier this month showing that citizens' access to government information in Eastern Europe is now equal to that in established democracies.
Indeed, the report, Transparency and Silence, conducted by the Open Society Justice Initiative (available at www.justiceinitiative.org), indicates that in some ways the new democracies have something to teach the old: certain government agencies in Romania were more responsive to citizen requests for information than comparable agencies in France and Spain.
Specifically, 60% of the requests filed in Romania met, compared to 31% in France and 24% in Spain.
Other countries that performed well include Peru and Mexico, both of which adopted freedom of information laws in 2002, shortly after Romania.
But getting access to sensitive information in transitional democracies is not always easier, as I know from my previous work as a human rights lawyer with the Romanian Helsinki Committee.
Often we had to go to court to force disclosure of information, using Romania's 2001 Freedom of Information Act.
For example, even when we won a case regarding access to the records of wiretaps authorized by the general prosecutor, the prosecutor simply ignored the court order.
We filed a civil action against the prosecutor, and the judge imposed a fine for every day the information was withheld.
But it was only when we caught the media's attention that the data -- detailing the number of wiretaps authorized over the previous 10 years, against whom, and for how long -- were released.
With its publication, Romania began to move away from its Securitate-dominated past.
Now, inside government, I realize that sharing information with the public is sometimes hard.
But when painful reforms are necessary, there is no alternative.
We could not have achieved the economic and political reforms that qualified us for EU membership if we had not subjected policymaking to public scrutiny and accepted the increased public participation in decision-making that inevitably accompanies such openness.
Indeed, this has become a sine qua non of democratic government throughout the world.
When the United States adopted its Freedom of Information Act in 1966, it joined the exclusive company of Sweden and Finland.
Today, roughly 65 countries have such laws.
In Romania, those who fought for a freedom of information law have made full use of it.
As part of the Justice Initiative study, those who request information from Romania's government were willingly supplied with the kind of information that would have been unthinkable to release just a few short years ago.
The Romanian Defense Ministry, for example, disclosed the number of armed forces personnel who died in 2003, as well as the causes of death (including 13 suicides, two shootings, and two combat deaths in Afghanistan).
Likewise, the Bucharest court was asked for the number of judges disciplined since the beginning of 2000, including grounds for any sanctions applied.
The Court transferred the request to the Superior Council of Magistrates, which provided a full response: a four-page list of all sanctioned judges, with details of the reasons and penalties.
Such information is both a product and a motor of continuing reform.
It has not always been comfortable for those in government, and there is still a tug-of-war over sensitive documents.
But, in the former communist bloc, the benefits brought by transparency have been undeniable.
At the same time, Romania's experience demonstrates that official secrecy remains a threat to the core values of democratic governance, and that only constant vigilance, in both established and young democracies, can prevent its encroachment.
Saving the Trees of Life
Nobody can get through the day without using a product that comes from a forest.
To a greater extent than most people realize, the paper we write on, the water that comes out of our taps, the medicine that heals us, the wood that builds our houses and furniture, all originate from forests.
Forests provide the fresh air we breathe and habitats for endangered species.
They also provide us with recreational opportunities, increasingly important in our complex world.
Approximately 1.5 billion of the world's rural poor directly depend on forests for basic needs like food and fuel-wood.
Yet deforestation continues.
Every year, we lose 14.6 million hectares (56,000 square miles) of forests -- an area almost four times the area of Switzerland.
Irresponsible forest management, enhanced by poor governmental regulation and enforcement, and markets that reward illegal logging, are conspiring to denude the world's most valuable and threatened forests.
Once forests start to disappear, a host of environmental, social, and economic ills usually follow, affecting us all in some way.
Indonesia's Sumatra Island is a good example.
Pulp and paper companies are driving rampant and illegal destruction of forests that contain the richest diversity of plants in the world.
It is likely that plants not yet discovered will disappear along the way, as well as such endangered species as the Sumatran rhino and elephant, as well as the orangutan.
When Sumatra's forests disappear, entire communities of people will also find themselves with no proper place to live and no decent way to make a living.
Moreover, the distortion to global markets caused by trading in illegally, cheaply produced products results in disadvantages for responsible corporate citizens.
Developing countries are losing $15 billion in tax revenues annually due to illegal logging.
To make matters worse, the demand for wood for reconstruction following last year's tsunami is intensifying the already untenable demands being placed on Sumatra's forests.
Similar threats to forests are evident in the Amazon and Congo Basin.
The recent UN Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) shows that forests in these and other critical regions are in serious decline due to mismanagement and will continue to disappear unless serious measures are taken.
Information released by the government of Brazil indicates that deforestation of the irreplaceable forests of the Amazon, due to factors such as agricultural conversion, reached 2.6 million hectares (roughly 10,000 square miles) in the past year, bringing the total deforested area of the Amazon to 17%.
But the battle against deforestation is not lost.
Diverse organizations, environmentalists, and corporations concerned with the state of world's forests are joining forces to reverse deforestation and improve forest management.
For example, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the World Bank have helped Brazil's government kick-start an initiative that established over 17 million hectares (69,000 square miles) of new forest-protected areas such as national parks.
The WWF/World Bank alliance also motivated partners to establish a trust fund to manage these protected areas in perpetuity.
Similarly, a summit among the leaders of the Congo Basin countries resulted in extraordinary cross-border cooperation on forest conservation and responsible management.
This in turn led to a $53 million initiative by the United States State Department to promote Congo forest conservation.
Since the leaders first met in 1999, 3.5 million hectares (more than 13,000 square miles) of new protected areas have been established in the Congo Basin.
Nevertheless, given the effects of last December's Asian tsunami, the weight of evidence provided by the MEA, and deforestation statistics from key forest regions, our efforts must continue.
The World Bank and WWF recently pledged to unite in an effort to assist in reducing the rate of global deforestation by 10% by 2010, and to work with other public and private sector institutions to pursue ambitious targets on forest conservation.
WWF studies show that if the world's forests are allotted among a mix of uses and types -- including protected areas, responsibly managed commercial forests, and restored forest landscapes -- we can provide the world's needs for forest products while conserving important environmental and social values for the foreseeable future.
Business leaders, governments, and civil society organizations must play their part in realizing this vision.
Are the Saudis Fanatics?
Terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia have led many to question not only the ruling House of Saud's prospects for survival, but also whether the kingdom is fundamentally dysfunctional and destructive.
Somehow, it seems, Saudi society has produced a stream of violent fanaticism that draws its inspiration from extreme religious orthodoxy.
The fact that 15 of the 19 hijackers in the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States were Saudis crystallized a long-held view of the kingdom as a bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance.
In some respects, this perception is accurate, but it cannot be applied to the broad Saudi public.
On the contrary, it would be a grave mistake to assume that fanatical Islamism fully defines Saudi attitudes toward religion.
Between 2001 and 2003, I was part of a team that undertook an extensive survey of values in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran, and Jordan.
Our results provide a surprisingly nuanced picture of Saudi attitudes.
Compared to respondents in the other Middle Eastern countries, Saudis were less religious overall, and their attitudes toward democracy and arranged marriage also indicate a moderate undercurrent.
To be sure, in all four countries, religiosity is widespread, with more than 90% of respondents collectively reporting that they believe in God, in life after death, and in heaven and hell.
But the Saudis appear to be less religious than their fellow Muslims.
Sixty-two percent of Saudis described themselves as religious, compared with 82% of Iranians, 85% of Jordanians, and 98% of Egyptians.
Americans also appear to be far more religious than Saudis, with 81% describing themselves that way.
Some of this variation may be explained by cross-national differences regarding what it means to be religious.
For example, Americans may define religiosity differently than Middle Easterners, with perhaps a weaker attachment to religious beliefs than is true in Islamic countries.
This might also account in part for the differences between Muslim countries.
But the gap in self-defined religiosity between Saudis, on the one hand, and Iranians, Jordanians, and Egyptians, on the other, is so great that it challenges the prevalent perception of Saudi Arabia as a highly conservative and religious society.
Indeed, actions speak louder than words: only 28% of Saudis said that they participate in weekly religious services, compared to 27% of Iranians, 44% of Jordanians, 42% of Egyptians, and 45% of Americans.
These findings, while running contrary to popular perceptions of Saudi culture, are less startling than they appear.
Sociologists of religion have long argued that in a monolithic religious environment, or when religious institutions are closely tied to the state, the overall religiosity of the public declines.
It makes sense to think that when state authorities enforce strict codes of behavior, people tend to rebel and move away from officially sanctioned religious institutions.
Little wonder, then, that Egyptians and Jordanians, who live in countries where the state does not enforce piety, are more religious than Iranians or Saudis, who must cope with local "virtue" police backed by the state.
Even on marriage, many Saudis expressed surprisingly liberal views.
Respondents were nearly evenly split on the question of arranged marriages, with half supporting the idea that marriage should be based on parental consent, while 48% preferred love as the basis of matrimony.
Given entrenched gender segregation and paternal dominance, this finding appears to reveal a strong desire for greater individual choice in what has traditionally been a family-driven decision.
Finally, the Saudis turn out to be strong supporters of democracy, once again contradicting a popular image of Saudi conservatism.
Of the Saudis polled, 58% considered democracy the best form of government, 23% disagreed, and 18% did not express an opinion.
Majority support for democracy in a country with no prior secular and nationalist history seems counter-intuitive.
In fact, support for democracy corresponds with a number of other liberal attitudes that we found in Saudi Arabia.
Supporters of democracy tend to be less religious, more secular, more tolerant of others, more critical of public-sector performance, and more concerned with Western cultural invasion.
Beyond the survey data, history has shown that liberal ideas become more popular when a despotic monarch governs people in alliance with a religious establishment.
A strong current of liberalism appeared in the late nineteenth century in Ottoman Syria in response to the religious despotism of Sultan Abdulhamid.
At the same time, an anti-clerical, secular movement on behalf of constitutionalism appeared in Iran - a reaction to the absolutist alliance between the Quajar Shahs and the religious establishment.
In view of the similarities between those historical precedents and current conditions in Saudi Arabia, we ought not to rule out the possibility of reform.
Now survey data, too, suggest that Saudis may well begin demanding a more transparent politics and a less interventionist religion.
The European Museum
In the late nineteenth century, Europe viewed Asia mainly as either a source of inspiration for its artists or a focus of imperial ambition.
Asians, for their part, viewed Europe as either a model of modernity, as in Meiji Japan, or a barometer of decay, as in China.
A century later, the Japanese economic miracle had transformed the image of at least a small part of Asia in European eyes into a place of rapid technological and industrial progress.
Now, in the first years of the twenty-first century, the perception of Europe in Asia and of Asia in Europe is changing dramatically, as Asia's economies boom while the European Union finds itself mired in a crisis of identity and confidence.
Prominent Asians, such as former Singaporean leader Lee Kuan Yew, are now warning Europeans that if they continue on their current course, Europe will rapidly become irrelevant for anything other than tourism and high-end real estate.
A prominent Chinese businessman who divides his time between Hong-Kong and London was even more specific.
At a private gathering of top business and political leaders in Paris a few weeks ago, he said, "You Europeans are becoming a Third World country, you spend time on the wrong subjects -- the constitution, the welfare state, the pensions crisis -- and you systematically give the wrong answers to the questions you raise."
Europeans' views of Asia in general, and China in particular, are more complex and swing from lucid adjustment to a new and respected competitor to pure ideological rejection.
In May 1968, in France, the students -- or some of them, at least -- who took to the streets to invent a new world were dreaming of Maoist China, a China in the midst of the brutal and senseless Cultural Revolution.
Their absurd and baroque infatuation was as much the product of ignorance of Mao's crimes as it was the result of boredom in a prosperous society where unemployment was virtually nonexistent.
Today, by contrast, their heirs are openly criticizing the Asian capitalist model.
Yesterday China was an anti-capitalist lodestar for utopian revolutionaries; today it has become an ultra-liberal nemesis for a new generation of utopian reactionaries -- the defenders of the status quo in Europe.
The student demonstrators in the streets of Paris recently don't want to become like Chinese and Indians; they reject the logic of globalization and refuse to surrender hard-won social guarantees.
European economic elites perceive China and India very differently.
They are now fully aware that their slightly nostalgic post-colonial view of these countries as large export markets and deep reservoirs of cheap labor has become outdated.
China and India have become genuine competitors who deserve respect, if not sheer awe.
Quality, costs, and delivery times in auto manufacturing, for example, are reaching the European level.
Europe retains an advantage in terms of pure science, as in the pharmaceutical industry, but emerging world-class companies, particularly in India, are increasingly able to recruit M.I.T. and Harvard graduates, while maintaining lower labor costs and thus global competitiveness.
Unfortunately, although European leaders recognize the Asian challenge, they have failed to use it as a reality test in the irresistible process of globalization and as a call to arms in social and economic terms.
In fact, it would be fair to say that European politicians, with few exceptions, such as Tony Blair, have been slow to adjust their worldviews in accordance with the revolutionary pace of change in Asia.
Caught between their lack of long-term strategic vision and their obsession with short-term interests, Europe's political leaders have largely failed to win the respect of their Asian counterparts, in contrast to European companies, which are faring much better in Asian eyes.
Of course, on a continent that has largely failed to bury its past and close the door to nationalist ghosts, the EU is also often regarded by Asians as a model of reconciliation, peace, and prosperity.
But if Europe's performance continues to decline, would this perception survive?
Perhaps Asians would then come to regard the European model as a political version of Venice -- a place to visit with nostalgia for its past glory and admiration for its museum-like quality.
The Red and the Blue
Condoleeza Rice's replacement of Colin Powell as US Secretary of State shows that America's recent presidential election continues to produce powerful reverberations.
But understanding what that election tells us about America is important not only for Americans, but for the world.
This year's presidential vote proves that America's democracy is healthy, but that some things could be better.
Contrary to the election in 2000, when President Bush lost the popular vote and barely won the vote in the Electoral College, Bush prevailed this time by 3.5 million votes.
While some Democrats remain bitter, there is little serious questioning of the legitimacy of Bush's victory.
America remains closely divided into red states (Republican) and blue states (Democrat).
If 100,000 votes changed in the red state of Ohio, John Kerry would be the president (albeit with a minority of the popular vote).
The Electoral College was included in America's constitution to protect small states in a federal system, but it now means that the political campaign focuses largely on the dozen or so battleground states where public opinion is closely divided.
More fundamentally, there is something unseemly about electing presidents without a popular majority.
So it is time for a serious debate about amending the constitution to abolish the Electoral College.
Some observers also complain about the divisive negative rhetoric and advertising that characterized the campaign.
But this should be seen in historical perspective.
In the era of the Founding Fathers, newspapers were extremely partisan, and George Washington was dismayed by the harshness of political language.
For much of its early history -- to say nothing of the era of the Civil War and Reconstruction -- the country was as closely divided as it is today, and bitter campaign rhetoric reflected the closeness of the competition.
At the same time, despite negative advertising by both sides, the three nationally televised debates raised important issues in a serious format and were widely viewed.
In general, an incumbent president with a growing economy is likely to be re-elected.
In that sense, what was surprising about Bush's re-election was how thin his majority was.
In large part, this was because of the unpopularity of the Iraq War.
Kerry tried to make the war, the low rate of job creation, inadequate healthcare, and Bush's tax cuts for upper income groups the central issues of the campaign, but some observers felt that this never added up to a clear message.
Bush countered with concerns about security against terrorism and cultural populism on issues such as gay marriage and abortion rights.
In the end, security and cultural populism trumped economic populism.
Interpretation of the election has been influenced by exit polls in which voters were asked (after they voted) about which issues mattered most to them.
The largest number (22%) answered "moral values," comparison to 20% who cited the economy and 19% who mentioned terrorism.
Social conservatives interpreted this to mean that they won the election for Bush, and that their agenda should dominate his next term.
But a Pew poll taken a week after the election indicated that the category "moral values" encompassed a wide range of issues besides abortion rights and gay marriage.
In fact, polls show that 25% of the public support gay marriage and 35% favor legal civil unions for gay couples (the position advocated by Kerry).
Nonetheless, for the 37% who oppose gay marriage, particularly in the red center of the country, the issue helped mobilize Bush supporters to come to vote.
A larger question is whether the US is hopelessly divided.
The election map of red and blue states has given rise to Internet jokes and cartoons about the two blue coasts seceding from the red center of the country.
Some call it "Coastopia."
But the division is not that sharp.
Many states in both camps were won by narrow margins, and if one colors the map at the level of counties rather than states, much of the country looks quite purple.
Cities versus suburbs and rural areas is a better description than coasts versus heartland.
Indeed, public opinion polls show that most Americans are clustered in the moderate center of the political spectrum rather than at the two extremes.
But political elites, such as party activists and members of Congress, tend to be more extreme than the public.
At first, this seems puzzling, because they should have an incentive to move to the vote-rich middle.
But many members of Congress represent districts that are safe for their parties, and the threat to their re-election comes in party primaries that are dominated by the more activist and extreme wings of the parties.
This tendency is reinforced by the rise of cable television, which attracts viewers by means of contentious "infotainment" programs, and Internet bloggers, who engage in fierce polemics with no editorial filter.
Reforms to alter the boundaries of Congressional districts to make them more competitive would help alleviate this problem, but few incumbent Congressmen will vote for changes that might increase their risk of defeat.
The closeness of the result suggests Bush won less of a mandate for change than he seems to believe.
Faced with difficult questions in foreign, fiscal, and social policy, he would be wise to turn toward the center rather than conciliate his conservative base, but it remains unclear whether the politics of conviction or of pragmatism will prevail.
Kicking the Oil Habit
Chancellor Angela Merkel has made addressing climate change a high priority on Germany's agenda for its EU and G-8 presidencies that begin in January.
Here is a concrete proposal, one general enough for world leaders to consider and accept, and clear enough for other governments and businesses to grasp: simply set a date, at the next G-8 summit, by which oil-powered cars would no longer be licensed in major industrialized countries.
Such a decision would have a strongly positive economic and geopolitical impact.
The real cause of today's worries over energy is not the decline in world oil reserves, but rather that domestic oil production by the top consumers -- Europe, the United States, and China -- will decline at the very moment that growing Asian demand strains the market.
Available reserves will increasingly be concentrated in the Middle East simply because supplies in all other regions will be depleted sooner.
Moreover, the main oil exporters are unwilling to subordinate their investment policies to market requirements.
Saudi Arabia seeks to run its oil production independently, while Iran scares off potential investors with bureaucratic hurdles and corruption.
Iraq suffers from a lack of security, and foreign investors in Russia are thwarted at every turn.
Those four states contain half of the world's proven oil reserves and two-thirds of what could potentially be exported.
All this, not production costs, lies at the heart of high oil prices and the scramble for oil contracts in Central Asia and Africa.
To believe that high oil prices are good because they serve the environment ignores some basic facts of international politics.
First, in many of the poorest African and Asian countries, oil imports account for a significantly higher share of national expenditure than in industrialized countries, which means that economic growth and social development are being imperiled, while new debt crises loom.
Rents from oil production impede reforms in the major exporting countries.
Thanks to their lubricated financial strength, regimes like those in Venezuela and Iran increasingly feel unconstrained by international rules.
Latecomers among consuming nations, such as China, mimic the former habits of the industrialized West, with their long record of overlooking human rights abuses in order to secure lucrative deals with authoritarian, oil-rich regimes.
Only the world's political and economic heavyweights, the main industrialized countries that remain by far the biggest consumers of hydrocarbons, can initiate change on a global scale.
Change must begin in the transport sector, which accounts for more than half of current oil consumption -- a share that is likely to rise in the future.
The G-8 countries should therefore agree to no longer license any new, oil-powered cars from 2025 onwards.
This decision would not be directed against individual mobility, but against the dissipation of a scarce resource that is more urgently needed to produce synthetic materials.
Political leaders should not privilege any particular technology.
Instead, they should provide the automobile industry with incentives to develop alternative technologies that rely on bio-mass fuel, ethylene, hydrogen, and even natural gas during a transition period.
Countries that lead the way politically will, as a collateral benefit, provide domestic industries with a leading position in energy technology, ensuring future markets.
The expected significant reduction of CO2-emissions could eventually bring about the breakthrough that is needed in international climate policies.
But economic development comes into play as well: curing our "addiction" to oil would leave more of it to poorer, less developed, and newly industrializing countries, as well as pushing down prices and easing geopolitical energy competition.
Geopolitically, the benefits would similarly obvious, as the ability of major oil exporters to blackmail industrialized countries would be significantly reduced.
This could increase the bargaining power of the international community in the Middle East, and might strengthen those social forces in countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Russia that seriously wish to promote political and economic reform from within.
As a technologically advanced and major automobile-producing country, Germany is well placed to bring about such an initiative.
Merkel, who holds a doctorate in physics and started her political career as an environment minister -- presiding in 1995 over the first conference of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change -- may have more credibility in addressing the issue than any of her EU and G-8 colleagues.
Now is the time for a bold act of leadership.
The Trade-and-Aid Myth
Trade and aid have become international buzzwords.
More aid (including debt relief) and greater access to rich countries' markets for poor countries' products now appears to be at the top of the global agenda.
Indeed, the debate nowadays is not about what to do, but how much to do, and how fast.
Lost in all this are the clear lessons of the last five decades of economic development.
Foremost among these is that economic development is largely in the hands of poor nations themselves.
Countries that have done well in the recent past have done so through their own efforts.
Aid and market access have rarely played a critical role.
Consider a developing country that has free and preferential market access to its largest neighbor, which also happens to be the world's most powerful economy.
Suppose, in addition, that this country is able to send millions of its citizens to work across the border, receives a huge volume of inward investment, and is totally integrated into international production chains.
Moreover, the country's banking system is supported by its rich neighbor's demonstrated willingness to act as a lender of last resort.
Globalization does not get much better than this, right?
Now consider a second country.
This one faces a trade embargo in the world's largest market, receives neither foreign aid nor any other kind of assistance from the West, is excluded from international organizations like the WTO, and is prevented from borrowing from the IMF and the World Bank.
If these external disadvantages are not debilitating enough, this economy also maintains its own high barriers on international trade (in the form of state trading, import tariffs, and quantitative restrictions). 
As the reader may have guessed, these are real countries: Mexico and Vietnam.
Mexico shares a 2,000-mile long border with the United States, which provides not only privileged market access in goods and labor, but also a claim to the resources of the US Treasury (as became apparent during the 1995 peso crisis).
By contrast, America maintained a trade embargo against Vietnam until 1994, established diplomatic relations only in 1995, and did not provide most-favored nation treatment to Vietnamese imports for years after that.
Vietnam still remains outside the WTO.
Now consider their economic performance.
Since NAFTA was signed in December 1992, Mexico's economy has grown at an average annual rate of barely over 1% in per capita terms.
This is not only far below the rates of Asia's economic superstars; it is also a fraction of Mexico's own growth performance during the decades that preceded the debt crisis of 1982 (3.6% per year between 1960 and 1981).
Vietnam, however, grew at an annual rate of 5.6% per capita between the onset of its economic reforms in 1988 and the establishment of diplomatic relations with the US in 1995, and has continued to grow at a rapid 4.5% pace since then.
Vietnam witnessed a dramatic fall in poverty, while in Mexico real wages fell.
Both countries experienced sharp increases in international trade and foreign investment, but the pictures are utterly different where it counts most: rising standards of living, particularly for the poor.
What these examples show is that domestic efforts trump everything else in determining a country's economic fortunes.
All the opportunities that the US market presented to Mexico could not offset the consequences of policy mistakes at home, especially the failure to reverse the real appreciation of the peso's exchange rate and the inability to extend the productivity gains achieved in a narrow range of export activities to the rest of the economy.
What matters most is whether a country adopts the right growth strategy.
With none of Mexico's advantages, Vietnam pursued a strategy that focused on diversifying its economy and enhancing the productive capacity of domestic suppliers.
Broader post-war experience supports the conclusion that domestic policies are what matter most.
South Korea took off in the early 1960's not when foreign aid was at its apex, but when it was being phased out.
Taiwan did not receive foreign aid or preferential market access.
China and India, today's two economic superstars, have prospered largely through sui generis reform efforts.
It is tempting to ascribe the rare African successes -- Botswana and Mauritius -- to foreign demand for their exports (diamonds and garments, respectively), but that story goes only so far.
Obviously, both countries would be considerably poorer without access to foreign markets.
But, as in other cases of successful development, what distinguishes them is not the external advantages they possess, but their ability to exploit these advantages.
Witness the mess that other countries made of their natural-resource endowments.
The word "diamond" hardly conjures images of peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone.
Similarly, few of the export processing zones proliferating around the world have delivered the results observed in Mauritius. 
None of this absolves rich countries of their responsibility to help.
They can make the world less hospitable for corrupt dictators -- for example, by greater sharing of financial information and by not recognizing the international contracts that they sign.
Similarly, increasing the number of poor-country workers allowed to work in rich countries, and providing greater scope for growth-oriented policies by relaxing WTO rules and conditionality from the US, would produce greater long-term development impact.
It is far from clear that expanding market access and boosting aid are the most productive use of valuable political capital in the North.
Development should focus not on trade and aid, but on improving the policy environment in poor countries.
Who's Dependent Now?
If the late great Argentine economist Raul Prebisch were alive today, he no doubt would wonder whether the world had turned upside down.
His hugely influential "dependency" theory argued that if poor countries relied too much on commodity exports, they would never achieve the industrial depth needed to sustain rapid growth.
Instead, they would become mired in a cycle of declining global commodity prices and ever-dwindling income shares.
Prebisch's preferred policy response, protectionism, proved disastrous for the many Latin American and African countries that heeded him.
But the fact is that for many years, Prebisch seemed to have made the right call on long-term commodity price trends.
Relentless efficiency gains in agriculture and resource extraction pushed down prices for commodities, especially during the 1980's and 1990's.
With few exceptions, countries that focused on commodity exports performed dismally, whereas many resource-poor Asian countries raced ahead.
Today, however, with Asia's giants, India and China, joining the global economy, prices for oil, gold, wheat, and virtually every other commodity are exploding.
While there will always be cycles -- oil prices, for example, will probably fall before they start rising again -- the long-run trend for many commodities will clearly remain upward for some time to come.
What many trade negotiators and other policymakers do not seem to have recognized yet, though Prebisch would have realized it instantly, is that this dramatic turn of events carries huge implications for the global balance of power.
Indeed, perhaps no other aspect of economic globalization will pose greater challenges to world leaders over the coming decades.
The questions are many.
Are today's rich countries prepared for an era of co-dependency, in which they are just as desperate for commodities as developing countries are for industrial imports and technology?
Are they prepared for the inevitable flow of power and influence to commodity producers as they become much wealthier?
How will the world's two superpowers, China and the United States, come to terms with the fact that important commodity-exporting regions from Africa to the Middle East to Central Asia are littered with ill-formed nation states?
Some self-anointed seers portray the problem as being one of finite natural resources, with the world running out of critical commodities at an alarming rate.
Nowadays, there are many adherents of the "Hubbert's peak" theory of oil production, which holds that we have reached the upper limits of output capacity, the wells are running dry, and it is all downhill from here.
However, as leading oil historian Dan Yergin points out, prophets of doom have declared that the world is running out of oil at least four times already.
Each time, radical improvements in technology made the threat evaporate.
In the late 1800's, oil extraction involved dredging with a mule.
Today, no one thinks anything of drilling 3,000 meters beneath the ocean floor.
There have been similar improvements across the board in metals mining and agriculture.
No, the world is not about to run out of commodities.
Instead, what is happening is that the integration of 2.5 billion people (China and India alone) into the global economy is producing a demand shift that is likely to put far more upward pressure on commodity prices than any technology gains are likely to offset.
So, for at least the next 50 to 75 years, and perhaps until humans start mining on Mars sometime in the coming centuries, prices for many natural resources are headed up.
Will the rebalancing of global economic power that results from this destabilize world politics?
World War I, of course, was partly set off by Germany's concern that the other colonial powers had locked up too large a share of world oil and commodity supplies.
Similarly, in World War II, Japan feared for the stability of its foreign supplies of oil and other natural resources.
Will similar tensions arise between resource-challenged China (where even water scarcity is a problem) and the West?
Fortunately, this does not seem likely for the moment, especially given the Chinese leadership's sober and pragmatic approach to its resource problems.
The Chinese are looking to regions like Africa, hoping to find stable trading partners.
They do not share the political evangelism of the Americans, who don't just want to trade with commodity exporters, but to convert them as well.
Then there are those American leaders who still speak of making the US self-sufficient in energy supplies.
But this is basically a joke: self-indulgent, maybe, but self-sufficient, never.
Much of the Arab world understandably views the invasion of Iraq as the cornerstone of the real US strategy for securing stable energy supplies.
If they are right, one can only hope that America has a plan B.
Meanwhile, commodity prices will continue to rise, with oil exporters now constituting the largest contributors to America's gaping trade deficit.
Maybe the real US strategy is to try to owe the commodity-exporting countries so much money that they will feel dependent on making America happy!
That is one twist that Prebisch would never have anticipated.
Iran's Hardline Choice
Iran's choice for its next president, the hardline Mayor of Teheran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is likely to worsen relations with the West and the country's international isolation.
Yet in domestic terms the Islamist regime is likely to be better off than it would have been with a more moderate result.
Clearly, Ahmadinejad has a real base of support.
But the fact that he ran as a populist, talked about helping the poor, condemned the government's performance, and acted almost like an opposition candidate are all irrelevant: he was the regime's choice, and, in the end, he received official help even against rival hardline candidates.
The regime played its hand brilliantly.
It turned the slightly more pragmatic Hashemi Rafsanjani, who disagreed with some current policies, into the "establishment" figure and its own man into the rebel.
The government thus used anti-establishment feeling to revitalize its own rule.
Given the fact that the last president, Muhammad Khatami, was a supporter of the reform movement -- albeit a timid one who ultimately accomplished nothing -- only underlines how thoroughly the rulers turned around the political situation.
Ahmadinejad is a representative of the younger activists in the anti-Shah revolution of a quarter-century ago.
He was directly involved in the holding of American hostages in Iran, though exactly how much so remains a matter of dispute.
Most worrisome of all, he is close to the two main groups that represent the most extreme elements in Iran: the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Basij organization.
The first is a parallel pro-regime army; the second is an organization for intimidating opponents and anyone seeking a more open society.
However, concern that an even more radical leadership has taken over in Iran is mitigated by two factors.
First, Ahmadinejad is more likely to focus on domestic issues, trying -- with whatever degree of success is unclear -- to improve living standards for the poorest Iranians.
Second, the same group that has been in control ever since the revolution will basically continue to run ideological and foreign policy.
The president has fewer powers than it seems, overshadowed particularly by Supreme Guide Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Nevertheless, Ahmadinejad's election starkly clarifies the challenge that Iran poses for Western policy and Middle East stability.
First and foremost, it sends a signal to the most extreme elements in Iran and that country's terrorist clients -- Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and various small groups operating against Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and other Arab countries -- that they have a green light for launching attacks.
They are likely to assume that Iran will support them whatever they do.
Outwardly, Iran has often been relatively cautious, but, at the covert level, it has been the world's leading sponsor of terror.
Sometimes individual Iranian officials may have acted on their own to order and coordinate specific operations; they will now feel freer to do so.
Moreover, Ahmadinejad openly advocates Iran's crash program to obtain nuclear weapons.
Most Iranian politicians -- at least those allowed by the government to function openly -- support the program, but favor a quieter and more cautious approach.
Rafsanjani, for example, put building better economic relations with the West ahead of pushing forward on the nuclear front.
If Ahmadinejad is president of a nuclear Iran, he is more likely to use the weapons in an adventurous manner.
This does not mean that he would fire them, but rather that he would use them for purposes of diplomatic blackmail, raising threats to crisis levels.
Since Iranian leaders daily proclaim their desire to wipe Israel off the map and to fight the US (Ahmadinejad stepped on a picture of an American flag on his way to vote), the risk of confrontation has increased.
Finally, Ahmadinejad is likely to be bolder in subverting stability in Iraq, and his victory will encourage radical Iranian officials and extremists within Iraq itself.
Iran is already sending many agents into Iraq and supporting clients seeking to turn that country into a clone.
Iraqis, including Shia Muslims -- who follow the same version of Islam as Iranians — generally reject such interference.
A more militant Iranian posture is likely to increase friction with Iraq, as well as inspire more anti-American violence there.
In short, Iran's electoral outcome is a dangerous one, though precisely how destabilizing it ultimately turns out to be will depend on Ahmadinejad's actions and the degree of power granted him by Khamenei.
Moreover, dealing with such an openly extreme Iran -- radical even by the hardline regime's standards -- will be a challenge not just for the US, but for Europe as well.
Will European countries try to pretend that Ahmadinejad's militant rhetoric and provocations don't matter and that some diplomatic solution to Iran's nuclear ambition can be found?
With Rafsanjani, either a real agreement or the pretense of cooperation would have been easy to maintain.
But, with Ahmadinejad, a high level of appeasement will be necessary for even the most minimal diplomatic process to continue.
Some Iranian reformers and exiles put a bright face on Ahmadinejad's election, arguing that his administration is more likely to show the regime's real face and disabuse any Western hopes of compromise.
Yet it may also represent the regime's success at co-opting dissatisfaction with a quarter-century of radical Islamist rule.
Whatever the outcome, for the West, Ahmadinejad's victory means that everything related to Iran is set to become even hotter.
Take From the Poor, Give to the Rich
President Bush seems poised to wreck America's budget for years to come.
When Bush came into office, the outlook was for budget surpluses as far as the eye could see.
Today, through a combination of irresponsible Republican-led tax cuts, a slowing economy, the bursting of the stock market bubble, and a massive increase in defense spending, huge deficits dominate the fiscal horizon.
Worse is coming, because the Bush Administration and the Republican-led Congress are preparing to deepen the fiscal mess.
The damage they will do will likely weaken the US and add instability to the world economy.
Traditionally, America's Republican Party stood for balanced budgets.
This changed with the Reagan Administration, when conservative Republicans favored tax cuts even at the cost of large budget deficits.
President Reagan told the American people that they could enjoy tax cuts, a military build-up, and continuation of their favorite spending programs all at the same time.
The result - no surprise - was a series of vast budget deficits that took years to clean up.
Both President George Bush Sr. and Bill Clinton had to raise taxes to clean up the Reagan-era mess.
Those tax increases probably contributed to President Bush Sr's defeat by Bill Clinton in 1992.
Yet Clinton bravely decided to complete the process of restoring fiscal balance, in part to protect the long-term financing of the Social Security retirement program.
When Clinton left office in 2000, the budget situation was the best in decades.
Then along came President George Bush Jr. to replay Reagan: large tax cuts, a big increase in military spending, and continuation or even expansion of popular spending programs.
The result was predictable.
In January 2001, the cumulative budget outcome for the years 2002-2011 was projected to be $5.6 trillion dollars in surplus.
By mid-2002, those projected surpluses had vanished.
In view of these changed economic conditions, and the shadow of war in Iraq, you might expect the Bush Administration and the Republican-led Congress to be cautious in advocating new tax cuts.
But no, their highest priority is to enact more tax cuts that will mainly benefit the rich.
At the same time, the Administration is calling for big increases in military spending.
With the November 2004 presidential election now coming into view, you can be certain that no meaningful cuts in non-military spending programs will be made.
So massive budget deficits seem here to stay.
If domestic spending simply stays constant as a fraction of national income, the cumulative budget outcome for the next ten years will be a combined deficit of $1.5 trillion.
But this figure may be optimistic, because it probably doesn't adequately factor in the costs of a possible war in Iraq, nor another round of tax cuts, nor the risk of higher interest rates in the years ahead.
Why are Republicans so unconcerned about this mess?
Some Republican care more about tax cuts for the rich than they do about almost anything else.
Others believe that deficits will force major cuts in domestic government spending, thus shrinking the state, which is their heart's desire.
The problem with this latter view is that most taxpayers like domestic programs, and will not readily support major spending cuts.
A more intriguing question is why do Americans vote for such policies, when they should know that trouble will probably result.
One answer is that many voters do not see the looming budget troubles.
A better answer is that most Americans did not actually vote for these policies.
Voter turnout in the 2002 election was only around 40%, of which around half went to the Republicans, or around 20% of eligible voters.
Of course, the outlook need not be so bleak.
War in Iraq may be avoided.
Proposed tax cuts may be watered down or abandoned.
But I predict large budget deficits for years to come, and a growing sense of unease within the US and abroad about America's macroeconomic situation.
Foreign investors may decide to cut back financing America's budget and current account deficits on favorable terms.
The dollar may weaken, and fears of inflation may become more pronounced.
All of this will make US policymakers less confident and less flexible in their responses to economic shocks.
The poor, both inside the US and abroad, could suffer the most, as President Bush and the Congress tell the American people and the world that, due to the large budget deficits, there is no money available to address problems of poverty, disease, and education.
Unless ordinary Americans wake up to these fiscal risks, the rich may walk away with another multi-billion-dollar gift as the country and the world bear the harsh consequences for years to come.
Lessons from America's Fiscal Recklessness
George W. Bush has done more to wreck US economic policy than any other President in American history, exceeding even his mentor, Ronald Reagan.
In just three years in office, he has destroyed a fragile political consensus that had taken a decade to construct, and that could take another decade to re-create.
In doing so, Bush has risked America's long-term economic health and social stability.
Because the long-term budgetary challenges that the US is so badly mismanaging are not unique, America's fiscal blunders provide important lessons for other countries.
The main problem with fiscal policy is that politicians can easily make themselves temporarily popular by cutting taxes and increasing public spending while running up massive public debts, leaving repayment to the future.
This trick can last a few years, but sooner rather than later budget deficits and growing public debt force a painful policy reversal.
Yet a cynical politician can buy himself re-election and perhaps be in retirement when the crisis arrives.
One would imagine that after hundreds of such episodes of fiscal irresponsibility around the world in recent decades, voters would be allergic to such tricks.
Yet Bush is doing it again, buying popularity today by doling out massive tax cuts while simultaneously increasing military spending and even raising expenditure on education and health.
The result is a budget deficit equivalent to more than 5% of GDP.
What's worse is that America's long-term budgetary prospects were already troubling before Bush began his reckless policies.
The US population is aging, so there will be a sharp increase in the costs of publicly funded health care and pension systems.
Careful calculations show that future revenues under the tax policies favored by Bush are likely to fall tens of trillions of dollars short of the costs of public pensions, health care, and other fiscal spending expected by the public.
At some point in the future, there will thus need to be steep increases in tax collections, sharp cuts in public spending, or both, to correct Bush's actions.
So why does the public support his policies?
Because the public has little understanding or concern about these long-term consequences, even though they will eventually hurt most Americans.
The richest taxpayers are, of course, happy because they received the bulk of the tax cuts.
Amazingly, the richest 5% of US taxpayers received almost half of the tax cuts, and these rich taxpayers clearly expect the other 95%--the middle class and the poor--to bear most of the future spending cuts and tax increases.
Meanwhile, Bush has convinced many poor and middle-class voters that they should be happy, too, without telling them that they will have to pay for their small tax cuts with much larger cuts in future government services if his administration's policies prevail in the long term.
If Americans had a political memory, they would understand that they already rode this fiscal "roller coaster" once in the past 20 years.
Ronald Reagan also came to office promising massive tax cuts and large increases in military spending.
The result was a huge budget deficit by the middle of the 1980's.
Tax cuts made Reagan enormously popular and helped win him re-election in 1984.
It then took over a decade--starting in Reagan's second term, and continuing through the terms of George Bush, Sr. and Bill Clinton--to get the budget back to surplus.
Of course, this meant approving fresh tax increases, which cost George Bush, Sr. his re-election and led to the polarized politics of the 1990's.
History will almost certainly repeat.
Some right-wing ideologues in the Bush administration believe that today's budget deficits will eventually force government social spending to be cut sharply.
They hope to dismantle programs such as Social Security and Medicare.
But the US public strongly supports these social programs.
So the right-wing strategy of cutting taxes first in order to force cuts in social programs later will fail, and eventually tax rates will have to rise.
Others in the Bush administration argue that tax cuts are important for pulling the US out of recession.
This argument is also mistaken.
America's economy could have recovered without the tax cuts, and perhaps even more robustly.
In any event, it is a huge mistake to base long-term tax policies on the short-run business cycle.
There are two vital lessons for other countries.
The first is that the looming US budget deficits will sooner or later limit America's international power.
Americans supported the Iraq war only because they didn't have to pay for it with increased taxes.
When Americans are forced to choose between foreign adventures and higher taxes, they will be much less likely to support expensive military operations abroad.
Indeed, the US will be deeply divided internally as the public grapples with the fiscal mess left by Bush.
The second lesson is that countries ought to plan their budgets taking into account the rising fiscal costs of an aging population.
Long-term budgetary conditions are rarely in clear view of taxpayers or the parliament.
Governments should be required to submit long-term budget assessments together with their annual budget proposals, in order to reduce the tendency towards short-run political manipulation of the budget.
The US can serve as an early warning to other countries.
The White House ought to provide others with the same caveat that magicians on television give their viewers: "Do not try this at home."
The Political Stock Market
Many economic and financial analysts complain that emerging countries' stock markets are often heavily manipulated by their governments and are more political than economic.
The unstated assumption seems to be that, in contrast, some pristine force of economic nature drives stock markets in advanced countries, and that forecasting their performance is thus like forecasting the growth of trees.
This description of stock markets in emerging countries is not wrong, just biased, because the same description applies to stock markets in advanced countries.
Indeed, the best analysts know that forecasting the performance of any country's stock market substantially means forecasting how well the government wants stock market investors to fare in the current political environment.
Consider the United States stock market, by far the world's largest.
The general perception is that the government leaves companies alone and that the returns from investing in the US stock market reflect the fundamental forces of a strong capitalist economy.
This is one reason why the US is a magnet for portfolio investors from around the world.
But the returns that make US stock markets so attractive reflect a delicate political balance.
In particular, tax rates that affect stocks have varied through time as political pressures change.
During World War II, for example, political support for great fortunes diminished and the government sharply increased taxes on capital gains, dividends, and high incomes in general.
When World War II produced a strong recovery from the Great Depression of the 1930's, President Roosevelt and Congress slapped on an excess-profits tax to ensure that shareholders would not benefit too much.
By contrast, in 1980, when there was no war but the stock market was low, US voters elected Ronald Reagan, a man many thought too right wing to be president.
He asked for - and got - cuts in capital gains, dividend, and income taxes.
Political interference in the stock market is not merely about taxes on capital gains, dividends, and income.
Property taxes, excise taxes, import duties, and sales taxes - all of which are paid, directly or indirectly, by corporations - can have a magnified impact on corporate profits, and hence on the stock market.
It is no coincidence that wherever stock markets thrive, governments take care that these taxes stop well short of destroying after-tax corporate profits.
Indeed, the politics of stock markets does not stop with taxes.
On the contrary, almost every activity of government has an impact on corporate profits, and in turn, on the stock market.
After the 1929 stock market crash the US government suspended much anti-trust activity, allowing companies to acquire monopoly power that would boost their value.
This policy delayed the recovery from high unemployment, but even that was not enough to rein in the political forces arrayed in favor of supporting the stock market.
Similarly, one of the most important things that President Reagan did was to destroy much of the remaining power of America's labor unions, which compete for their share of the corporate pie.
Reagan's defeat of the Air Traffic Controllers' strike in 1981 was a watershed event for the US labor movement - and for the stock market, which started its dramatic bull market in 1982.
The US government has been particularly aggressive in supporting the stock market since the peak of the equities price bubble in 2000, most notably cutting interest rates repeatedly.
Of course, this was publicly justified in terms of stimulating the economy, not supporting the stock market.
But it is a telling sign of the US stock market's significance that one of the most important factors perceived to be weighing on the economy was declining equity prices.
Indeed, the authorities' response was not limited to monetary stimulus.
The US National Income and Product Accounts show that the effective rate of corporate profits tax (the percentage of profits actually paid to the government in taxes) crested at 33.7% in the first quarter of 2000 - the peak of the stock market and the economy in general - and fell to 20.2% in the fourth quarter of 2003, when the market was down.
Much of that decline reflects explicit tax relief measures voted by Congress, as well as the perception among corporations that in the current economic and political environment they can be more aggressive in tax avoidance.
Moreover, after the stock market crash, the maximum tax on dividends paid on stocks was slashed from 35% to 15%, giving a substantial new advantage to long-term investors and boosting the compounding effect of reinvesting after-tax dividends.
Again, this tax cut was justified in terms of stimulating the economy, which can, of course, be said of practically any measure aimed at supporting the stock market.
But it is the balance of political forces that determines whether such a justification will be credible.
One might say that the same variables, including hostility to high taxes and a weak labor movement, have operated in the US for the past 200 years - and can thus be expected to continue operating in the future, producing high stock market returns and attracting huge inflows of foreign investment.
Those who believe that investments in the US stock market will maintain the same strong growth trend for decades may well be right.
But one should be clear about what one is forecasting.
Essentially, one is forecasting not just economics, but politics - and even the cultural values - that shape economic policies and performance.
The Global Home
Homes are the most local of investments, rooted to a particular place like a tree, and thus thriving or withering in response to local economic conditions.
The whole world flashes by on our television screens, but the market for our homes, which is comprised almost entirely of local amateurs, remains grounded right there in our own backyard.
Soon, however, this could all change.
Within a month, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), in collaboration with my company, MacroMarkets, as well as Fiserv and Standard & Poor's, will launch futures and options contracts on home prices in ten cities in the United States.
The contracts will be settled on the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices, which developed out of academic work that my colleague Karl Case and I pioneered almost twenty years ago.
For many years we have been campaigning for housing futures, but no exchange wanted to use such indices to create a futures market until now.
The futures markets on home prices will allow investors around the world to invest in US homes indirectly, by buying interests in them through these markets.
An investor in Paris, Rio de Janeiro, or Tokyo will be able to invest in owner-occupied homes in New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.
A fundamental principle of financial theory -- "diversification" or "risk spreading" -- implies that interest in the new contracts will be high.
People and businesses in New York, for example, are overexposed to their local real estate risks, so they should reduce this risk by selling New York home price futures.
People in Tokyo will assume some of this risk by purchasing New York home price futures if the price is right.
The New Yorkers still live in their own homes, but now they have spread their investment risk worldwide.
A genuine futures market on single-family homes has not been attempted since 1991 when the London Futures and Options Exchange (now merged into Euronext.liffe) failed in its effort to launch such a market in Britain.
That attempt never generated much trading volume.
The Exchange threw a party and no one came.
British spread-betting markets for home prices, and some retail online markets, have never amounted to much either.
Will it be different this time?
To be sure, starting a new market is always an uncertain proposition: people want to go to parties only if a lot of other people are there; if no one is there, no one wants to come.
Likewise, in markets without many investors, not enough trades can be executed to generate the returns needed to attract them.
As is often true of great parties, it can be a bit of a mystery how substantial new markets get started, but we know that it does happen from time to time.
Initial indications suggest growing interest in futures trading for home prices, particularly as so much talk about the "housing bubble" underscores the importance of diversifying risk.
After the CME's announcement, one of its competitors, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, said that it plans to create futures and options contracts on major US regions, to be based on the median home price published by the National Association of Realtors.
But, aside from strong public interest in investing in housing and in hedging housing risks, another critical issue must be resolved if futures markets are to succeed: prices must be revealed, and investors must understand what these prices mean.
I believe there is a very good chance that many of these futures markets will soon be predicting substantial price declines in some US cities over the next year.
They will be in what traders call "backwardation": the future price in the market today is lower than the price of a home today.
Maybe backwardation won't appear on the first day that housing futures are traded, but there is a good chance it will come within a matter of months.
We may need backwardation in some of these markets if they are to fulfill their function.
Everyone knows that there has been a huge real estate boom in many of these cities (and elsewhere in the world) in recent years.
International investors are not likely to want to invest in these cities unless expectations of a price decline are built into the futures markets, as people in Tokyo understand from their own bitter experience.
But if backwardation is strong enough, even investors who think that the US housing market is headed for a fall will still be able to expect a good return from home price futures, because they are already getting a discounted price in the futures market.
Nevertheless, it will require some adjustment for New Yorkers seeking to hedge their own real estate investments to sell futures contracts that have a built-in price decline.
They will have to get used to the idea that the market already expects the decline, and that they can protect themselves only for that margin of possible future price declines that exceed this expectation.
In fact, such adjustments in our thinking will likely occur when we actually see the futures market prices.
Until now, the future course of real estate prices has been merely a matter of diverse opinion.
When markets create an international consensus on the future price of homes in cities around the world, we will be better able to manage the risks facing these cities, thereby stabilizing their economies -- and our own lives.
What News Is Moving the Markets?
Stock markets in much of the world have shown sharp cumulative declines since around May 10, with most of the drop occurring in the two-week period to around May 23, but with prices continuing to fall on average since then.
Does trouble in the world's stock markets mean trouble for the world economy?
Let us look at the biggest declines.
Of the major countries' indexes, the biggest crash was in India, where stock prices fell 16.9% from May 10 to May 22.
The debacle on the other side of the globe was almost as big and the peaks and troughs were within a day or two of those in India: in Argentina, stock prices fell 16.1%, in Brazil, they fell 14.7%, and in Mexico, they fell 13.8%.
European markets also suffered large losses.
In Sweden, stock prices fell 15.2% between May 9 and May 22; over nearly the same period, prices fell 9.7% in Germany , 9.4% in France and the United Kingdom, and 9.3% in Italy.
Likewise, in Asia, stock prices fell 11.5% in Korea, 9.3% in Hong Kong, and 8% in Japan from their respective peaks to troughs over very nearly the same time period.
Many commentators try to tie such events to developments the United States.
But US stock prices fell only 5.2% between May 9 and May 24.
Nor does China appear to be behind the global decline, since stock prices there actually rose during this period.
Economists' standard explanation revolves around monetary policy.
In the wake of the great deflation scare of 2003, central banks around the world cut interest rates, setting off speculative booms in both stock and housing markets.
But now, according to this view, rising interest rates are beginning to bite, which portends further declines in asset prices.
There is certainly an important element of truth in this argument.
The US Federal Reserve did indeed raise rates on May 10, and its chairman, Ben Bernanke, indicated then that there may be further rate increases in the future.
Worsening US inflation data were reported on May 17, suggesting that further monetary tightening is in store.
Economists like to view the world as logical and manageable, which implies that they understand what is happening.
But, in doing so, they often exaggerate central banks' role.
Indeed, the US rate increase was just one in a series of rate hikes -- the 16th in a row.
No other major central bank raised rates after the stock market drops began in May until June 7- 8, when several did (the European Central Bank, India, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey)
Another factor is the price of oil, which rose 24% from March 22 to May 2, setting all-time records along the way.
Surely, this was a major event that would plausibly affect stock markets all over the world.
Oil price increases have been a culprit in virtually every economic recession since World War II.
Still, the oil price increases do not correspond to the time interval in mid-May when stock market indexes fell most sharply.
To argue that oil price increases caused the stock market declines presupposes a time lag of several weeks.
But stock markets are not very logical, and there could be a lagged response to the oil price shocks.
As with any other prices in financial markets, an increase attracts attention.
When oil prices rise quickly, people watch the news related to oil prices and talk to each other more about oil prices, hence creating heightened sensitivity to this news.
The crisis in the Middle East is tied to oil prices, and it dominated the news in May.
Ominous signs and strong language used by various political figures were possibly amplified in investors' minds by the oil price increases.
On May 8, Israeli Vice Premier Shimon Peres, reacting to hostile statements by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said that "the president of Iran should remember that Iran can also be wiped off the map."
Similarly, near the beginning of the May stock market tumble, Ahmadinejad visited Indonesia, the world's most populous country with a Muslim majority, and newspapers reported on May 13 that he had received a standing ovation from students at two of the country's top universities.
This story might have been interpreted as evidence that Ahmadinejad's brinkmanship on the nuclear issue was paying off for him politically, fueling a perception that the tense situation in the Middle East might lead to even higher oil prices.
These news stories may seem far more remote from the stock market than is monetary policy.
But public reaction to them, together with recent oil price increases, may well account in good measure for the change in market psychology.
Attitudes toward risks change over time, and events like Ahmadinejad's and Peres's remarks can precipitate such changes.
So, while these things happen in ways that are hard to quantify, maybe analysts should pay attention to the words of Ahmadinejad just as carefully as they do to those of Bernanke in trying to understand the direction of the world's stock markets.
Economists might not like to focus on the public mindset and how it interacts with price changes, world news stories, and speculative dynamics.
After all, doing so implies that economic events are less predictable (and economists less omniscient) than they like to imagine.
But such a focus makes intuitive sense.
What is really on investors' minds?
Ahmadinejad is a charismatic figure; Bernanke is not.
Ahmadinejad is embarking on an adventure; Bernanke is not.
And, perhaps most importantly, Ahmadinejad is a destabilizing influence; Bernanke is not.
Indeed, whatever their ultimate cause, the mid-May drops in stock prices throughout the world are indicative of unstable market psychology.
It is difficult to believe that they were related only to opinions about likely monetary policy, and not to larger and deeper issues, including such things as energy and political tension, that underpin the performance of the world economy.

Why Pay More for Fairness?
Marks & Spencer, a supermarket and clothing chain with 400 stores throughout Britain, recently announced that it is converting its entire range of coffee and tea, totaling 38 lines, to Fairtrade, a marketing symbol of "ethical production."
The chain already sells only Fairtrade tea and coffee in its 200 Café Revive coffee shops.
It is also boosting its purchases of shirts and other goods made with Fairtrade cotton.
The announcement came during "Fairtrade Fortnight," a two-week promotion of Fairtrade products that included speaking tours by farmers from developing countries, telling Britons how Fairtrade has assisted their communities.
The movement toward more ethical consumption has made significant gains in the United States as well, as consumers increasingly turn to organic, locally produced foods, and eggs from hens not kept in cages.
In the UK, a survey has found that half of those shown the Fairtrade symbol recognized it and understood that it refers to products that give a better deal for Third World farmers.
There is no comparable US research, but related data, and discussions with my own students, suggests that the figure would be much lower.
Traders seeking Fairtrade certification must pay producers a price that covers the costs of sustainable production and provides a living wage.
For example, the minimum price for coffee is $1.26 per pound, no matter how low the market price may fall.
If the market price rises above that figure, the fair trade price will increase so that it remains five cents per pound higher.
Small farmers, for their part, are required to be organized in cooperatives or other groups that allow democratic participation.
Plantations and factories can use the Fairtrade label if they pay their workers decent wages, comply with health, safety, and environmental standards, allow unions or other forms of workers' associations, provide good housing if workers are not living at home, and do not use child labor or forced labor.
Not every one approves of Fairtrade.
Brink Lindsey, director of the pro-market Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies, believes that the campaign for Fairtrade coffee is a "well-meaning dead end."
With some justification, he argues that the real cause of the fall in coffee prices was not the profiteering of multinationals, but big increases in coffee production in Brazil and Vietnam, combined with new techniques that make it possible to grow coffee with less labor and hence more cheaply.
In Lindsey's view, if we want to assist coffee growers, we should encourage them either to abandon coffee and produce more profitable crops -- and here he rightly points to rich nations' trade barriers and subsidies as obstacles that must be dismantled -- or to move into higher-value products, like specialty coffees, that bring higher prices.
What is curious about Lindsey's argument, however, is that the Fairtrade coffee campaign can be seen as doing just what he recommends -- encouraging coffee farmers to produce a specialty coffee that brings a higher price.
Pro-market economists don't object to corporations that blatantly use snob appeal to promote their products.
If people want to pay $48 for a pound of Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee because that's what James Bond prefers, economists don't object that the market is being distorted.
So why be critical when consumers choose to pay $12 for a pound of coffee that they know has been grown without toxic chemicals, under shade trees that help birds to survive, by farmers who can now afford to feed and educate their children?
Economists might reply that if you want to help people feed and educate their children, you can pay $10 for a pound of non-Fairtrade coffee that tastes the same and give the $2 you save to an aid agency that provides food and education to poor children.
That's a possible strategy, but there are advantages to Fairtrade.
The growers know that they have to provide a product that consumers like, both for its taste and for the way it is grown.
If their product sells well, they can take pride in having produced something that is sought after around the world.
From the growers' perspective, receiving a premium by selling a Fairtrade product is preferable to receiving a charitable handout that they would get whether they worked or not and regardless of the quality of what they produce.
Paying more for a Fairtrade label is no more "anti-market" than paying more for a Gucci label, and it reflects better ethical priorities.
Fairtrade is not a government subsidy.
Its success depends on market demand, not political lobbying.
Fortunately, in Europe, that market demand is growing rapidly.
One hopes that it will soon reach similar levels throughout the developed world, and wherever people can make choices about their discretionary spending.
Pigs, Calves, and American Democracy
Amidst all the headlines about the Democrats gaining control of the United States Congress in the November elections, one big election result was largely ignored.
Although it illuminated the flaws of America's political system, it also restored my belief in the compassion of ordinary Americans.
In Arizona, citizens can, by gathering a sufficient number of signatures, put a proposed law to a direct popular vote.
This year, one of the issues on the ballot was an act to prohibit tethering or confining a pregnant pig, or a calf raised for veal, in a manner that prevents the animal from turning around freely, lying down, and fully extending his or her limbs.
Those who know little about modern factory farming may wonder why such legislation would be necessary.
Under farming methods that were universal 50 years ago, and that are still common in some countries today, all animals have the space to turn around and stretch their limbs.
Today, however, about 90% of US breeding sows -- the mothers of the pigs that are raised and killed for pork, bacon, and ham -- spend most of their lives locked in cages that measure about two feet by seven feet (0.6 meters by 2.2 meters).
They are unable to turn around, lie down with their legs fully extended, or move more than a step forward or backward.
Other sows are kept on short tethers that also prevent them turning around.
Veal calves are similarly confined for all their lives in individual stalls that do not permit them to turn around, lie down, or stretch their limbs.
These methods are, essentially, labor-saving devices -- they make management of the animals easier and enable units with thousands or tens of thousands of animals to employ fewer and less skilled workers.
They also prevent the animals from wasting energy by moving around or fighting with each other.
Several years ago, following protests from animal welfare organizations, the European Union commissioned a report from its Scientific Veterinary Committee on these methods.
The committee found that animals suffer from being unable to move freely and from the total lack of anything to do all day.
Common sense would, of course, have reached the same conclusion.
Following the report, the EU set dates by which close confinement of these animals would be prohibited.
For veal calves, that date, January 1, 2007, is almost here.
Individual stalls for sows, already outlawed in the United Kingdom and Sweden, will be banned across the entire EU from 2013.
Measures to improve the welfare of laying hens, which are typically kept crammed into bare wire cages with no room to stretch their wings, are also being phased in.
In the US, no such national measures are anywhere in sight.
In the past, when my European friends have asked me why the US lags so far behind Europe in matters of animal welfare, I have had no answer.
When they pressed me, I had to admit that the explanation could be that Americans care less about animals than Europeans.
Then, in 2002, animal welfare advocates put a proposal to ban sow stalls on the ballot in Florida.
To the surprise of many, it gained the approval of 55% of those voting.
Last month in Arizona, despite well-funded opposition from agribusiness, the ban on small cages for sows and veal calves also passed, with 62% support.
Neither Florida nor Arizona are particularly progressive states -- both voted for George W. Bush over John Kerry in 2004.
So the results strongly suggest that if all Americans were given a chance to vote on keeping pregnant pigs and calves in such tight confinement, the majority would vote no.
Americans seem to care just as much about animal welfare as Europeans do.
So, to explain the gap between Europe and the US on farm animal welfare, we should look to the political system.
In Europe, the concerns of voters about animal welfare have been effective in influencing members of national parliaments, as well as members of the European Parliament, resulting in national legislation and EU directives that respond to those concerns.
In the US, by contrast, similar concerns have had no discernible effect on members of Congress.
There is no federal legislation at all on the welfare of farm animals -- and very little state legislation, either.
That, I believe, is because agribusiness is able to put tens of millions of dollars into the pockets of congressional representatives seeking re-election.
The animal welfare movement, despite its broad public support, has been unable to compete in the arena of political lobbying and campaign donations.
In US electoral politics, money counts for more than the opinions of voters.
Party discipline is weak, and Congressmen must themselves raise most of the money that they need for re-election -- and that happens every two years for members of the House of Representatives.
In Europe, where party discipline is strong and the parties, not the individual candidates, finance election campaigns, money plays a smaller role.
In the US, a nation that prides itself on its democratic traditions, pigs and calves are hardly the only losers.
What's New About the New All-Afghan Army?
The murder of Afghanistan's Minister of Aviation by a mob (perhaps incited by members of Afghanistan's own interim administration) shows that Afghan society remains deeply fissured.
The first reforms to Afghanistan's army will only make these divisions worse.
The Minister of Defense in Hamid Karzai's temporary administration in Kabul has already named the top officers of this new army.
The Minister, General Mohammed Fahim, is a Tajik from the Panjshir district in the North, who rose three months ago to command the Northern Alliance forces that captured Kabul after American bombers cleared the way for them.
As a group, his appointments pose a direct challenge to Mr. Karzai's goal of reunifying the country.
Afghanistan is a multi-ethnic nation, the largest group being Pashtuns, with two-fifths of the total.
Hazaras and Tajiks constitute about a fifth each of the population.
Of thirty-eight officers elevated to general's rank by Mr. Fahim, thirty-seven are Tajiks, the other being Uzbek.
If any of the country's fifteen to seventeen million Pashtuns are recruited as soldiers, they will serve under a command structure made up almost entirely of Tajiks.
The Pashtuns' language, however, is as different from Tajik as Spanish is from English and millions of Pashtuns of military age know only a smattering of Tajik, at best.
The geographical profile of the new military leadership is as narrow as its ethnic makeup.
Thirty-five of the thirty-eight senior officers hail from one small area north of Kabul consisting of Parwan province (where the Bagram airport is located) and the nearby Panjshir valley, long the Northern Alliance's stronghold.
Stated differently, potential leaders from twenty-seven of Afghanistan's twenty-nine provinces were excluded from their country's new military elite.
Perhaps so narrow-based a group could overcome the impression that its members are a closed clique if they represented a broad cross-section of the country's dozen or more political parties.
But this is not the case.
Eighteen of the thirty-eight top brass come from one party, the Jamiat-e-Islami, the Islamic faction that has long been led by mullah and former theology professor Burhanuddin Rabbani.
It was this party that ruled Kabul briefly in the mid-1990s, creating the bloodshed and chaos that caused most Afghans to welcome the coming of the Taliban.
Almost equaling the number of Jamiat members in the army hierarchy are Communists.
Sixteen of the thirty-eight have long been aligned with this party, whose ploys in the late 1970s led to the Soviet invasion of 1979-89 which cost two-and-a-half million Afghan lives.
Most Afghans today view the Communists with the same degree of sympathy that Czechs or Poles reserve for Hitler's National Socialists.
True, people in Afghanistan, as elsewhere, joined the Communist Party for various reasons, and by no means were all of them hard-core ideologues.
But in the case of General Fahim's generals, six were professional Communist Party workers, and continued to serve the Party after the Red Army's invasion.
All six of these men, plus three more Communists who served as officers in the Afghan army, collaborated actively during the Soviet's decade-long occupation of Afghanistan.
Imagine how the French would have reacted if a quarter of France's post-World War II officer corps had sided with the Wehrmacht during its occupation of their country.
In Afghanistan news travels quickly by word of mouth.
Afghan nationalists (which includes nearly all Afghans) will soon discover the political backgrounds of members of General Fahim's inner circle, if they don't know already.
Even this overwhelming evidence of one-sidedness and bias in the formation of the new army's high command could be neutralized if the generals brought professionalism and commitment to the patriotic values of a truly national armed forces to their work.
Unfortunately, only ten of the thirty-eight brass promoted by Fahim have backgrounds as professional military officers.
An eleventh served as a pilot.
By contrast, twenty-four of the total (the backgrounds of the remaining four are unknown) come from civilian life, whether the professions, Communist Party offices, or in one case, a career as a mullah.
What do all these statistics mean in terms of day-to-day reality?
They mean that when the commanders of the international peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan, as well as American military and diplomatic officials, meet Afghanistan's Deputy Minister of Defense they will encounter Abdul Rashid Dostum, a notoriously brutal and corrupt warlord and Communist who keeps in touch with old Red Army friends still serving in Moscow.
It means that the Chief of the Afghan Armed Forces, as well as the Chief of Operations and the Chief of Army Intelligence are also Communists, men whose loyalties remain uncertain and are distrusted by most Afghans.
Is this a team likely to bring war-torn Afghanistan together?
Is the presence in Kabul of so dubious a crew likely to instill confidence in the three-quarters of Afghanistan's population who are shut out of the top army command?
Or is this list, rather, the harvest of a "winner-take-all" approach to governance that is bound (at some future point) to unleash another bloody national backlash by those whose legitimate interests have been cynically trampled?
UN, European, and American policymakers should ponder these questions before allowing themselves to acquiesce in a ruthless power grab by a small and unpopular minority.
Celebrating the Irrational
Three cheers for the new Nobel laureates in economics: Daniel Kahneman of Princeton University, and Vernon Smith of George Mason University in Virginia.
Like many Nobel prizes, these awards recognize not only the seminal work undertaken by Kahneman and Smith, but also the schools of thought they help to lead.
Kahneman, a psychologist, has demonstrated how individuals systematically behave in ways less rational than orthodox economists believe they do.
His research shows not only that individuals sometimes act differently than standard economic theories predict, but that they do so regularly, systematically, and in ways that can be understood and interpreted through alternative hypotheses, competing with those utilized by orthodox economists.
To most market participants - and indeed, ordinary observers -- this does not seem like big news.
Wall Street brokers who peddled stocks they knew to be garbage exploited the irrationality that Kahneman and Smith exposed.
Much of the mania that led to the bubble economy was based on exploiting investor psychology.
In fact, this irrationality is no news to the economics profession either.
John Maynard Keynes long ago described the stock market as based not on rational individuals struggling to uncover market fundamentals, but as a beauty contest in which the winner is the one who guesses best what the judges will say.
This year's Nobel prize celebrates a critique of simplistic market economics, just as last year's award (of which I was one of the three winners) did.
Last year's laureates emphasized that different market participants have different (and imperfect) information, and these asymmetries in information have profound impact on how an economy functions.
In particular, last year's laureates implied that markets were not, in general, efficient; that there was an important role for government to play.
Adam Smith's invisible hand -- the idea that free markets lead to efficiency as if by an invisible hand -- is invisible at least in part because it is not there.
This, too, is not news to those who work day after day in the market (and make their fortunes by taking advantage of and overcoming asymmetries in information).
For more than twenty years economists were enthralled to so called "rational expectations" models which assumed that all participants have the same (if not perfect) information and act perfectly rationally, that markets are perfectly efficient, that unemployment never exists (except when caused by greedy unions or government minimum wages), and where there is never any credit rationing.
That such models prevailed, especially in America's graduate schools, despite evidence to the contrary bears testimony to a triumph of ideology over science.
Unfortunately, students of these graduate programs now act as policymakers in many countries, and are trying to implement programs based on the ideas that have come to be called market fundamentalism.
Let me be clear: the rational expectations models made an important contribution to economics; the rigor which its supporters imposed on economic thinking helped expose the weaknesses many underlying hypotheses.
Good science recognizes its limitations, but the prophets of rational expectations have usually shown no such modesty.
Vernon Smith is a leader in the development of experimental economics, the idea that one could test many economic propositions in laboratory settings.
One reason that economics is such a difficult subject, and why there are so many disagreements among economists, is that economists cannot conduct controlled experiments.
Nature throws up natural experiments, but in most circumstances, so many things change so rapidly that it is often difficult to untangle what caused what.
In principle, in a laboratory, we can conduct controlled experiments, and therefore make more reliable inferences.
Critics of experimental economics worry that subjects bring to experimental situations modes of thought determined outside of the experiment, and thus that the experiments are not as clean and the inferences not as clear cut as in the physical sciences.
Nonetheless, economic experiments provide insights into a number of important issues, such as the improved design of auctions.
Most importantly, the irrationality of market participants, which was the focus of Kahneman's work, has been verified repeatedly in laboratory contexts.
Among the more amusing results that have come out of experimental economics are those concerning altruism and selfishness.
It appears (at least in experimental situations) that experimental subjects are not as selfish as economists have hypothesized--except for one group - the economists themselves.
Is it because economics as a discipline attracts individuals who are by nature more selfish or is it because economics helps shape individuals, making them more selfish?
The answer, almost certainly, is a little bit of both.
Presumably, future experimental research will help resolve the question of the relative importance of these two hypotheses.
The Nobel Prize signifies how important it is to study people and economies as they are, not as we want them to be.
Only by understanding better actual human behavior can we hope to design policies that will make our economies work better as well.
Bush's Bad-Faith Energy Policy
One of the more surreal sessions at this year's World Economic Forum in Davos had oil industry experts explaining how the melting of the polar ice cap -- which is occurring faster than anyone anticipated ­ -- represents not only a problem, but also an opportunity: vast amounts of oil may now be accessible.
Similarly, these experts concede that the fact that the United States has not signed the Law of the Sea, the international convention determining who has access to offshore oil and other maritime mineral rights, presents a risk of international conflict.
But they also point to the upside: the oil industry, in its never-ending search for more reserves, need not beg Congress for the right to despoil Alaska.
President George W. Bush has an uncanny ability not to see the big message.
For years, it has become increasingly clear that much is amiss with his energy policy.
Scripted by the oil industry, even members of his own party referred to an earlier energy bill as one that "left no lobbyist behind."
While praising the virtues of the free market, Bush has been only too willing to give huge handouts to the energy industry, even as the country faces soaring deficits.
There is a market failure when it comes to energy, but government intervention should run in precisely the opposite direction from what the Bush administration has proposed.
The fact that Americans do not pay the full price for the pollution -- especially enormous contributions to greenhouse gases -- that results from their profligate energy use means that energy is under-priced, in turn sustaining excessive consumption.
The government needs to encourage conservation, and intervening in the price system ­­ -- namely, through taxes on energy -- is an efficient way to do it.
But, rather than encouraging conservation, Bush has pursued a policy of "drain America first," leaving America more dependent on external oil in the future.
Never mind that high demand drives up oil prices, creating a windfall for many in the Middle East who are not among America's friends.
Now, more than four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, Bush appears to have finally woken up to the reality of America's increasing dependence; with soaring oil prices, it was hard for him not to note the consequences.
But, again, his administration's faltering moves will almost surely make matters worse in the immediate future.
Bush still refuses to do anything about conservation, and he has put very little money behind his continuing prayer than technology will save us.
What, then, to make of Bush's recent declaration of a commitment to make America 75% free of dependence on Middle East oil within 25 years.
For investors, the message is clear: do not invest more in developing reserves in the Middle East, which is by far the lowest-cost source of oil in the world.
But, without new investment in developing Middle East reserves, unbridled growth of energy consumption in the US, China, and elsewhere implies that demand will outpace supply.
If that were not enough, Bush's threat of sanctions against Iran poses the risks of interruptions of supplies from one of the world's largest producers.
With world oil production close to full capacity and prices already more than double their pre-Iraq War level, this portends still higher prices, and still higher profits for the oil industry -- the only clear winner in Bush's Middle East policy.
To be sure, one shouldn't begrudge Bush for having at last recognized that there is a problem.
But, as always, a closer look at what he is proposing suggests another sleight of hand by his administration.
Aside from refusing to recognize the importance of global warming, encourage conservation, or devote enough funds to research to make a real difference, Bush's grandiose promise of a reduction of dependence on Middle East oil means less than it appears.
With only 20% of US oil coming from the Middle East, his goal could be achieved by a modest shift of sourcing elsewhere.
But surely, one would think, the Bush administration must realize that oil trades on a global market.
Even if America were 100% independent of Middle East oil, a reduction in supply of Middle East oil could have devastating effects on the world price -- and on the American economy.
As is too often the case with the Bush administration, there is no flattering explanation of official policy.
Is Bush playing politics by pandering to anti-Arab and anti-Iranian sentiment in America?
Or is this just another example of incompetence and muddle?
From what we have seen over the past five years, the correct answer probably contains more than a little bad faith and sheer ineptitude.
China's Roadmap
China is about to adopt its 11th five-year plan, setting the stage for the continuation of probably the most remarkable economic transformation in history, while improving the well-being of almost a quarter of the world's population.
Never before has the world seen such sustained growth; never before has there been so much poverty reduction.
Part of the key to China's long-run success has been its almost unique combination of pragmatism and vision.
While much of the rest of the developing world, following the Washington Consensus, has been directed at a quixotic quest for higher GDP, China has once again made clear that it seeks sustainable and more equitable increases in real living standards.
China realizes that it has entered a phase of economic growth that is imposing enormous -- and unsustainable -- demands on the environment.
Unless there is a change in course, living standards will eventually be compromised.
That is why the new five-year plan places great emphasis on the environment.
Even many of the more backward parts of China have been growing at a pace that would be a marvel, were it not for the fact that other parts of the country are growing even more rapidly.
While this has reduced poverty, inequality has been increasing, with growing disparities between cities and rural areas, and between coastal regions and the interior.
This year's World Bank World Development Report explains why inequality, not just poverty, should be a concern, and China's 11th five-year plan attacks the problem head-on.
The government has for several years talked about a more harmonious society, and the plan describes ambitious programs for achieving this.
China recognizes, too, that what separates less developed from more developed countries is not only a gap in resources, but also a gap in knowledge.
So it has laid out bold plans not only to reduce that gap, but to create a basis for independent innovation.
China's role in the world and the world's economy has changed, and the plan reflects this, too.
Its future growth will have to be based more on domestic demand than on exports, which will require increases in consumption.
Indeed, China has a rare problem: excessive savings.
People save partly because of weaknesses in government social-insurance programs; strengthening social security (pensions) and public health and education will simultaneously reduce social inequalities, increase citizens' sense of well-being, and promote current consumption.
If successful -- and, so far, China has almost always surpassed even its own high expectations -- these adjustments may impose enormous strains on a global economic system that is already unbalanced by America's huge fiscal and trade imbalances.
If China saves less -- and if, as officials have announced, it pursues a more diversified policy of investing its reserves -- who will finance America's more than $2 billion a day trade deficit?
This is a topic for another day, but that day may not be far off.
With such a clear vision of the future, the challenge will be implementation.
China is a large country, and it could not have succeeded as it has without widespread decentralization.
But decentralization raises problems of its own.
Greenhouse gases, for example, are global problems.
While America says that it cannot afford to do anything about it, China's senior officials have acted more responsibly.
Within a month of the adoption of the plan, new environmental taxes on cars, gasoline, and wood products were imposed: China was using market based mechanisms to address its and the world's environmental problems.
But the pressures on local government officials to deliver economic growth and jobs will be enormous.
They will be sorely tempted to argue that if America cannot afford to produce in a way that preserves our planet, how can we?
To translate its vision into action, the Chinese government will need strong policies, such as the environmental taxes already imposed.
As China has moved toward a market economy, it has developed some of the problems that have plagued the developed countries: special interests that clothe self-serving arguments behind a thin veil of market ideology.
Some will argue for trickle-down economics: don't worry about the poor, eventually everybody will benefit from growth.
And some will oppose competition policy and strong corporate governance laws: let Darwinian survival work its wonders.
Growth arguments will be advanced to counter strong social and environmental policies: higher gasoline taxes, for example, will kill our nascent auto industry.
Such allegedly pro-growth policies would not only fail to deliver growth; they would threaten the entire vision of China's future.
There is only one way to prevent this: open discussion of economic policies in order to expose fallacies and provide scope for creative solutions to the many challenges facing China today.
George W. Bush has shown the dangers of excessive secrecy and confining decision-making to a narrow circle of sycophants.
Most people outside China do not fully appreciate the extent to which its leaders, by contrast, have engaged in extensive deliberations and broad consultations (even with foreigners) as they strive to solve the enormous problems they face.
Market economies are not self-regulating.
They cannot simply be left on autopilot, especially if one wants to ensure that their benefits are shared widely.
But managing a market economy is no easy task.
It is a balancing act that must constantly respond to economic changes.
China's 11th five-year plan provides a roadmap for that response.
The world watches in awe, and hope, as the lives of 1.3 billion people continue to be transformed.
Tocqueville's Lessons in Democracy
It seems appropriate that, due to the Iraq war, the world has been debating the nature of democracy 200 years after Alexis de Tocqueville's birth.
Tocqueville is justly famous for rejecting reactionary nostalgia and regarding democracy's triumph as our destiny, while warning against the dangers that democracy holds for liberty.
Should we still share his worries?
Tocqueville viewed democracy not only as a political regime, but, above all, as an intellectual regime that shapes a society's customs in general, thereby giving it a sociological and psychological dimension.
Democratic regimes, Tocqueville argued, determine our thoughts, desires, and passions.
Just as there was Renaissance man and, in the twentieth century, homo sovieticus, "democratic man" is a form of human being.
For Tocqueville, democracy's systemic effects could lead citizens to deprive themselves of reasoned thought.
They could only pretend to judge events and values on their own; in reality, they would merely copy the rough and simplified opinions of the masses.
Indeed, what Tocqueville called the hold of "social power" on opinion is probably strongest in democratic regimes -- a view that foretells the growth of modern-day demagogy and media manipulation.
Tocqueville believed that there are no effective long-term constraints on this tendency.
Neither local democracy nor small societies, neither governmental checks and balances nor civil rights, can prevent the decline of critical thought that democracy seems to cause.
Schools have the power to be little more than enclaves from the corrosive strength of social influences on how the mind works.
Similarly, while Tocqueville thought that pursuing virtue as the ancients did, or having a religious faith, could sometimes elevate the soul, both conflict with the democratic ideal if they become officially prescribed in public life.
In this sense, Tocqueville's intellectual heirs include the neo-Marxist theorists of the Frankfurt School, as well as Hannah Arendt, all of whom feared above all the disintegration of reason in modern societies.
Indeed, the French philosopher Marcel Gauchet entitled a recent book Democracy Against Itself.
The democratic way of life, these writers argue, tends to destroy original thought and to suppress "high" culture, yielding a mediocrity that leaves citizens vulnerable to democracy's enemies.
But, while history is replete with murderous regimes applauded by cowed and deceived masses, the greater risk for democratic nations is that their citizens withdraw into apathy and short-term thinking for immediate gratification.
The past -- despite rituals that seek to commemorate historic moments -- is obliterated by an addiction to the now and the new.
Even the supposedly well-educated ruling class is subject to this bewitchment.
The essential problem of the democratic mind is its lack of historical consciousness.
Do the defects of democracy really mean, as Tocqueville claimed, that resigned pessimism is the only -- realistic but unsustainable -- path open to us?
I don't think so.
There are means to fight against what might be called today's growing "democratic stupidity."
The first defense is to push for an educational system that really forms critical minds, namely through the (nowadays) largely neglected subjects of literature, history, and philosophy.
If the informed and critical citizenry that democracy requires is to be formed, our schools must stop pandering to the latest popular fads and begin to sharpen the analytical capacities of students.
The biggest impediment to such an education are the mass media, with its tendency to cultivate superficiality and amusement.
Many people nowadays spend more of their lives watching television than they do in classrooms.
The passivity that mass media encourages is the polar opposite of the active engagement that democratic citizens need.
But it is hard to imagine that the mass media (other than quality newspapers) would, of their own volition, become instruments of an education that enhances citizens' critical capacities.
This concern about mass media is no mere elitist scorn for popular culture.
The question is not one of popularity alone -- after all, Mozart was popular in his day, and Shakespeare's plays attracted the poor as well as the rich -- but of mass culture's refusal to challenge and provoke.
The result of the failure is a generalized indifference and passivity in audiences.
Indeed, for a long time a globalized media culture, one unable to inspire the capacity for critical thought or create elevated feelings, has been on the rise.
It is a culture that, through its carelessness, threatens democratic freedom because it fails to create any sense of obligation -- to society, to history, to community.
Is it too late to do anything about a culture that so deadens the spirit?
Tocqueville despised the elites of his time for their complacency in the face of the deracinating force of mass democracy.
Will the myopia of our leaders also serve as an agent of his disquieting prophecy?
A Europe for All
Longtime members of the European Union now seem to doubt the Union's future, but we in Ukraine look at the European Union with hope and admiration.
To join in the EU's progress is the basic object of our foreign policy, for Ukraine has discovered that nationhood is not an end, but a beginning.
Indeed, European unity is indivisible: when one nation is ostracized, all are not free.
We Europeans are caught in an inescapable net, tied in a single garment of destiny.
Every aspect of our shared culture, if not the last century of shared suffering, confirms that for us.
Whatever affects one European directly, affects all indirectly.
Never again can we afford to live with the narrow notion of two Europes, of haves and have-nots, of insiders and outsiders.
Anyone who lives within the European continent cannot -- indeed, must not -- be considered a stranger to its Union.
Today's great Pax Europa and today's pan-European prosperity depend on this.
Of course, some people mutter that Ukraine is not Europe.
Let them come to Kyiv and speak to the people, young and old, factory worker, farmer's wife, the lawyers and doctors and teachers who stood and stayed in the cold and snow for weeks on end last winter to defend their freedoms.
Are they not united with those who stood alongside General de Gaulle in the French Resistance?
Are they not one with those who died fighting for the Spanish Republic in the 1930's, who liberated Budapest in 1956 and ended fascism in Spain and Portugal in the 1970's?
Are they not animated by the same spirit as Poland's Solidarity and the peaceful masses that created Prague's Velvet Revolution in 1989?
That is the true European spirit, and no doubts can crush it.
To those who say that Ukraine is too backward for EU membership, I say: Let them, too, come to my country and see the mothers who stay late at night at work teaching their children to use their workplace computer.
Let them come to the language classes in every village and city where young people are readying themselves for Europe by learning French and German and English.
Those who doubt Ukraine's European vocation should understand that Europe is not a matter of hardware and superhighways; it is the unquenchable desire for freedom, prosperity, and solidarity.
I believe that our future is as promising as Europe's past is proud, and that our destiny lies not as a forgotten borderland on a troubled region, but as a maker and shaper of Europe's peace and Europe's unity.
Self-determination no longer means isolation, because achieving national independence nowadays means only to return to the world scene with a new status.
New nations can build with their former occupiers the same kind of fruitful relationship that France established with Germany -- a relationship founded on equality and mutual interests.
That is the type of relationship that my government seeks with Russia, and achieving it is how we can help extend the zone of Europe's peace.
Of course, it is premature to do more than indicate the high regard with which we view the prospect of EU membership.
We know that our part in that great edifice will not be built overnight.
We know that the great works of European unification lay not in documents and declarations, but in innovative action designed to better the lives and insure the security of all Europeans.
Building a Ukraine worthy of EU membership will not be easy, cheap, or fast.
But, like the Union itself, it will be built and it will be done.
We know the challenge is great, but the prize is worth the struggle, and Europe should know that this is our goal.
Part of the work of renewing Ukraine is a creative battle to put an end to a nightmarish century during which fascism and communism -- ideologies born in the heart of Europe -- battled for mastery.
Only a few months ago, in cities throughout Ukraine, our children and our parents confronted armed troops, snarling dogs, and even death.
Only a few years ago, a young journalist, Georgi Gongadze, seeking to inform the public about our old regime's corruption, was brutalized and beheaded by that regime's thugs.
But our Orange Revolution last winter shows that Ukraine's people prevailed.
So, despite today's doubts and difficulties, I retain an abiding faith in Europe.
I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities and horrors of Ukraine's history.
I refuse to accept the view that Ukraine is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of communism's legacy that we can never see the bright daybreak of peace and true European unity.
When the EU's citizens ponder Ukraine's place in Europe, they should look both beyond and more closely at the face they see.
They should look beyond the ravaged wastelands that communism inflicted, beyond the poverty, and beyond the social divisions through which our discarded ex-leaders sought to prolong their misrule.
Instead, they should look closely at the face of our president, Viktor Yushchenko, ravaged by poison during last year's election campaign, and recall the words of the great Frenchman André Malraux, for whom "the most beautiful faces are those that have been wounded."
The Muslim Civil War
Is the Sunni-Shia divide in the Middle East now deeper than the antagonism between Israel and the Arabs?
You might think so given the response of some Arab governments to Hezbollah's decision to attack Israel.
Even as Israeli bombs fell on Beirut and Tyre, Saudi Arabia, perhaps the most conservative Arab Muslim state of all, openly condemned the actions of the Shia Hezbollah in instigating conflict with Israel.
Never before in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict has a state that considers itself a leader of the Arab Muslim peoples backed Israel so openly.
Moreover, Saudi Arabia's breach with Hezbollah is not a one-time occurrence.
Egypt and Jordan have also roundly condemned Hezbollah and its leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, for their adventurism.
What is behind this stunning development?
Are we seeing a fundamental shift in relations between Arab nationalism and Islamic sectarianism?
Is Saudi Arabia's Sunni government more concerned and frightened by Shia Islam than it is committed to Arab unity and the Palestinian cause?
Arab denunciations of Hezbollah suggest that the Muslim sectarian divide, already evident in the daily violence in Iraq, is deepening and intensifying across the Middle East.
President George W. Bush's desire to shatter the Arab world's frozen societies was meant to pit the forces of modernization against the traditional elements in Arab and Islamic societies.
Instead, he appears to have unleashed the region's most atavistic forces.
Opening this Pandora's Box may have ushered in a new and even uglier era of generalized violence, perhaps what can only be called a "Muslim Civil War."
The Shia-Sunni divide has existed from the dawn of Islam, but the geographical and ethnic isolation of non-Arab Shiite Iran, together with Sunni Arab countries' dominance of their Shia minorities, mostly kept this rivalry in the background.
These tensions further receded in the tide of the "Islamization" created by the Iranian revolution, for in its wake Arabs' sectarian identity as Sunni was pushed further into the background as a generalized "Islamic" assertiveness appeared.
That all changed when Al Qaeda, a Sunni terrorist force that draws heavily on Saudi Wahabbi ideology and personnel, launched its attacks on America in September 2001.
A specifically Sunni brand of militant Islam was now on the march.
When the United States initiated wars on both the Sunni Taliban in Afghanistan and the Sunni Iraqi regime, this new radical Sunni strain became even more emboldened.
The region's newly assertive Sunni Arabs perceive Israel and the West as being only one threat, the other comprising the so-called "Shia crescent" -- the arc of land extending from Lebanon to Iran through Syria and Iraq that is inhabited by the allegedly heretical Shia.
Saudi Arabia's rulers, as custodians of the Muslim faith's holiest places in Mecca and Medina, perhaps feel this threat most keenly.
In Sunni eyes, the Shia not only dominate the oil-rich areas of Iran, Iraq, and the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, but are -- through the actions of Hezbollah -- attempting to usurp the role of "protector" of the central dream of all Arabs, the Palestinian cause.
It is because the Saudi royal family derives its legitimacy from a strict form of Sunni Islam and doubts the loyalty of its Shia population that the Kingdom has turned on Hezbollah.
Ironically, it is America, Saudi Arabia's longtime protector, which made Shia empowerment possible by overthrowing Saddam Hussein and bringing Shiite parties to power in Iraq.
The Bush administration seems to recognize what it has done; as the Shia arc rises in the east of the Arab Muslim world, the US is attempting to strengthen its protection of the Sunni arc -- Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia -- in the region's west.
Israel, the once implacable enemy of the Arab cause, now seems to be slotted into this defensive structure.
But such a defensive posture is bound to be unstable, due to pan-Arab feelings.
Today, ordinary Saudi citizens are glued to Al Jazeera and other Arab satellite TV networks to follow events in Gaza and south Lebanon.
They see Arab (not Shiite) blood being shed, with only Hezbollah fighting back.
In their eyes, Hezbollah has become a heroic model of resistance.
This is causing the Saudi state to deepen the Sunni-Shia schism.
Following the Kingdom's official denunciation of Hezbollah, the Saudi state called on its official Wahhabi clerics to issue fatwas condemning Hezbollah as Shiite deviants and heretics.
Such condemnations can only sharpen sectarian divisions within Saudi Arabia and the region.
As these antagonisms deepen, will the Sunni regimes come to believe that they need their own Hezbollah to fight in their corner?
If that is what they conclude, they need not look far, for many such fighters have already have been trained -- by Al Qaeda.
Georgia on Europe's Mind
The era in which Europe could rely on America to wage war, make peace, and establish democracy in its own backyard is over.
With European Union enlargement, and as the recent Russian gas crisis demonstrated, that backyard now includes not just Ukraine, but Georgia as well.
Indeed, as in Ukraine, Georgia is undergoing a test of democracy that Europe cannot afford to ignore.
Georgia was the first post-Soviet country to stage a "color revolution," and thus to demonstrate, with dignity and maturity, its people's choice for democracy and European values.
The European Union flags that have flown on all Georgian public buildings since then signal a natural attachment, as old as the history of a country that, for the ancient Greeks, was an integral part of the world as it was then known.
Prometheus, Medea, the Amazons and, in neighboring Armenia, Noah's Ark -- the Europe of our myths starts here.
With its history, culture, and traditions -- including its critical, independent, and even rebellious spirit within the former Soviet Union -- Georgia would seem to be an ideal candidate for successful democratization.
So it is all the more worrisome that democratization there is foundering.
Everything seemed to have started well enough.
Political reforms, privatization, anti-corruption measures, a search for new leaders untainted by compromise with the former regime, and implementation of a pro-European foreign policy met no resistance.
But the totalitarian mindset has since resurfaced in leaders who, with their claim to represent the will of the majority, appropriate more and more power.
Like the ancient Greeks' Hydra, Georgia's political elite never ceases to die and be reborn.
The same people and governing methods that the "Rose Revolution" of November 2003 sought to defeat have reemerged at the center of power by using their personal networks, which extend outside Georgia's borders, as well as their tremendous wealth and finely honed skills at political scheming and manipulation.
This bears little in common with the essence of democracy, which consists not merely in ballot boxes, but in the separation of powers.
The government meddles in the affairs of the parliament, which in turn seeks to micro-manage the government -- including, in my case, the nomination of ambassadors and their daily routines!
Finally, and more seriously, the judiciary is not yet independent, undermining the rule of law and thus deterring badly needed private investment.
Georgia's democracy exists in its head, but not yet in its body: citizens still spurn politics as a dirty pursuit, abandoning the ground to those who should have been retired long ago.
But the hope of democracy remains strongly rooted in Georgia's people, civic organizations, and media.
Now is the time for Europe to ensure that this hope is not extinguished.
The US has already done as much as it can to support political stability in Georgia since independence.
To be sure, stability was not always identified with democracy during the rule of Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Union foreign minister who was ousted as our president by the Rose Revolution.
But Americans invested generously in the survival of democratic ideas and leaders.
Although the foundation backed by the financier George Soros did not fabricate the Rose Revolution, as Russian nationalists claim, it certainly nurtured, encouraged, and supported democracy's preconditions.
But, to help consolidate its democracy, Georgia now requires support of a different nature, which Europe is better equipped to offer.
The models for the balance of powers, the functioning of the judiciary, and local democracy must be inspired by European forms, which are closer to Georgian reality than Anglo-Saxon models of the American type.
Europe's rejection of this challenge would betray its fundamental duties in a place -- small, Mediterranean, flexible, with old historical traditions -- where democracy stands a much greater chance of success than in Ukraine, which is both huge and still very Soviet-minded, not to mention Central Asia.
Indeed, refusal to support Georgia's struggling democracy would most likely postpone democratic progress in Ukraine, Belarus, even in Russia itself.
This clearly raises the stakes.
Russia, while never renouncing its imperial dreams and instruments of domination, was nonetheless coming to terms with the inevitability of democracy, at least on its margins.
But this hesitant acceptance of a certain normality in its relations with its neighbors has always been vulnerable to a sudden eruption of Russia's famously irrational "derzhava" -- an aggressive ethos that glorifies the state and asserts its strength by pouncing on weakness.
This is the key to understanding the recent Russian gas crisis.
Just as surely, any sign of a retreat from democracy in Georgia and other post-Soviet states will merely fuel Russia's neo-imperial ambitions.
It is Europe's responsibility to convince Russia that there is no hope of a return to the past.
Europe must assume this role not only to ensure the future independence of its energy supply, but also to demonstrate that European values of freedom, democracy, and justice between peoples have real force.
To succeed, Europe must equip itself with the necessary instruments: a large semi-public foundation to promote Europe and support political reform, a university to train future executives of nascent democracies, a police force, and an army of judges and magistrates to breathe life into the models that we want to emulate.
Above all, Europe needs conviction.
If Europe today cannot convince itself that it has a vital interest in its neighbors' future, who will believe in Europe tomorrow?
Berlusconi at Bay
Silvio Berlusconi, who becomes President of the European Union on July 1, is a perceptive man who once loved taking risks and his business bets proved to be profitable. In the 1960s, he was the first to see that Milan, a traditional Italian city where people walked to go to work, will become a modern metropolis with American style suburbs.
So, he built his fortune on real estate expansion.
Fifteen years later, Signor Berlusoni understood that the Italian state's monopoly of television would not survive and jump-started what became Italy's main privately owned media group.
But you don't win in TV and the real estate business without the right political connections.
On both occasions, Berlusconi outwitted his competitors by siding with the Socialists, at the time the rising stars of Italian political life.
His long association with Bettino Craxi, Milan's most influential politician in the 1970's and Italy's prime minister through much of the 1980's, started early.
On the other hand, political connections do not make a politician.
Indeed, the jump from business into politics was probably not Berlusconi's own preference.
By the 1990's, his media group was in trouble, weakened by excessive diversification (the decision to enter the retail-distribution business almost destroyed the group).
Almost at the same time, ex-premier Craxi fled to Tunisia, chased there by the Italian courts at the height of the mani pulite (clean hands) investigation into the vast network of corruption known as Tangentopoli (Bribesville).
Craxi's flight and exile left Berlusconi feeling lost--and without the reliable political backing that he needed.
So he decided that he needed to become his own political sponsor.
As has happened frequently in Italian history, Berlusconi's decision to form a new political party, Forza Italia , just a few months before the 1994 general election paid off handsomely.
Berlusconi's lack of experience in politics doomed his first government to collapse after only six months.
Any other man as rich as Berlusconi would probably have given up.
But Berlusconi remained and led the opposition for six years.
In 2001 his determination was rewarded with a clear victory and, more importantly, a seemingly clear mandate for change.
Once again Berlusconi probably had no choice: by the late 1990's, his association with the disgraced Socialists was haunting him politically and legally.
His only hope of fending off the magistrates was to control parliament and introduce new laws that would stop the series of corruption trials he faces--a strategy that has now given him immunity from prosecution until he leaves office.
Unfortunately, while Berlusconi's government is invariably long on speeches, legal provisions designed to stop the clock on his court cases are among the few laws that have passed in his two years of government.
Berlusconi's performance in government is a combination of good intuition--for instance the early attempt to reform Italian pensions in 1994--and poor implementation, most likely because of a lack of courage, as surprising as that seems.
In 1994, during his first government, he understood early on that Italy needed to overhaul its pension system, and introduced bold legislation.
But one general strike was enough to kill his reformist zeal.
More recently, he courageously sided with the US on the war in Iraq, against the majority of the country and most of his own political coalition.
But soon he seemed scared of his own boldness and faded into an almost invisible ally.
Despite Berlusconi's rhetoric, he did not go (or was not invited) to the summit meeting with President Bush in the Azores, where the final decision to go to war was taken.
On labor reforms, he fought the unions head on, but he chose the wrong fight: Italy's infamous "Article 18," which allows labor courts to return a worker to his job if a judge believes that the worker was unjustly fired.
But while Article 18 is important in principle, it is almost irrelevant in practice.
The outcome was a confrontation with the unions that distracted from more important labor reforms.
Contrary to what happened in 1994, Berlusconi's current government survives, but whoever hoped for a free-market revolution will be disappointed.
There has been no tax cut of any significance, and pension reform is still waiting.
Berlusconi's powerful finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, speaks often and fondly of the necessity of renewed government intervention in the economy; nothing is done to prevent strikes in the public transportation sector.
Moderate right-wing voters, who wanted an Italian (i.e., somewhat watered-down) version of the Reagan/Thatcher era are disillusioned.
Berlusconi tries to mask his inactivity by scaring his voters, repeating again and again that electing the moderate left would mean signing a pact with the devil, i.e., the "communists."
Italians seem smarter, as the result of the June administrative elections clearly have shown.
Why has the courageous visionary of the 1960's and 1970's lost his shine?
Part of it is precisely that it is no longer the 1960's and 1970's: Berlusconi is 40 years older and for the past ten years has lived in the world of Roman politics.
There he learned the art of political (and personal) survival, but lost his vision and his love for risk taking.
Closing the US-Europe Technology Gap
In the second half of the 1990's, Europe's average annual growth rate of productivity amounted to 0.7%, while the US hummed along at 1.4%.
However, if we distinguish between the industries that produce information and communications technologies (ICT) and those that are simply users of such technologies, we can see that the productivity growth gap stems almost entirely from the weakness of Europe's ICT producing sector.
Annual productivity growth in sectors that are users of ICT technologies averaged 0.63% in the US between 1995 and 2000, and a very similar 0.41% in Europe.
This confirms a well known fact: Europe is less efficient than the US at producing research that is conducive to innovation--either because Europe allocates fewer resources to research, or because the available resources are used less efficiently, or both.
To be sure, total spending on research and development is lower in Europe than in the US, but not by much.
In the 1990's, the US devoted 2.8% of GDP annually on R&D, compared with 2.3% in Germany, 2% in the UK, and 1.9% in France.
Still, European governments typically complain about the lack of fiscal resources to support R&D (a far fetched argument given the miniscule share of research spending in the oversized European budgets) and, whenever the European Commission allows them, they subsidize innovative firms, or those that they think are more likely to invest in R&D.
France and Italy, for example, demanded that the limits imposed the budget deficits of euro zone members by the Stability and Growth Pact exclude public spending for research.
Similarly, the French government decided to bail out Alstom--a company that developed a number of high-tech products, including the TGV, the French fast train--before ending up bankrupt.
But both tactics are unlikely to boost the European high-tech sector.
Why?
Because weakness in research is not--at least not primarily--a funding issue.
Subsidies will not produce efficient high-tech firms.
Let us consider research first.
Europe trails the US in every dimension: the number of patents, the number of Nobel laureates, the number of researchers it is able to attract from the rest of the world.
But funding is only part of the problem.
A euro spent on research in Europe is less productive than a dollar spent in the US for two reasons: incentives and the demand for technology.
We fear that spending more money without changing archaic university rules would produce more waste, not more research output.
It would only increase the power, prestige, and resources of entrenched lobbies of established university professors who often prevent entry and competition.
Demand for technology is also important.
It helps focusing research, it provides deadlines, screens the output, and allows patents to be valued at market prices.
Without the incentives provided by those on the receiving end of its output, research risks drifting along, often without clear direction.
Admittedly this is not true in all fields: the study of Ancient Greek fragments is valuable even it meets hardly any demand.
But it is important in those fields, both theoretical and applied, that might be used as an input in the production of new technologies: physics, biology, chemistry, engineering, etc.
But it is defense spending that is the major factor in the demand for research.
Most technological breakthroughs in the postwar period--from microchips to the Internet to the new batteries for cellular phones developed for the US Army in Iraq--had, at least initially, a military application.
Cell phones, satellite tracking, and high-resolution cameras are not cheap to come by, but happily for the industries that use them, costs for their development have been partly picked up by the government.
One key reason for the superiority of the US in research is the size and the composition of defense expenditure.
The Pentagon's budget is not simply big: it accounts for more than one half of all US government spending on research and development: in France, defense spending is only around a quarter of the total.
In 1999, US spending on defense-related R&D was 0.45% of GDP; the UK and France were next, but with just half as much, 0.26% and 0.22%, respectively.
As the Alstom case suggests, the French have a different model in mind.
Rather than supporting R&D with large defense budgets, they prefer to do it directly, subsidizing French high-tech firms.
The official justification is that national defense budgets are too small to create the demand that would be needed to support R&D in high-tech sectors, while there is still no European defense budget.
This is no coincidence: if allocated competitively, such a supra-national budget would identify winners and losers.
But many European countries still refuse to accept that some of their high-tech firms might not make it: better, they think, to keep them alive with generous subsidies, and in the meantime avoid the consolidation of EU defense budgets.
By integrating its defense expenditures and increasing their size, Europe would hit two birds with one stone.
It would be more credible when it demands to be heard at international bargaining tables, particularly vis-à-vis the US, and it would stimulate scientific research.
The way to achieve these goals is not to run larger deficits, which merely imply higher taxes tomorrow, but to cut spending in other parts of the budget.
In short: short-run pain for long-run gain.
The American Way of Debt
After almost 15 years of unprecedented growth - interrupted only by a brief slowdown in 2000-2001 - the United States has accumulated a huge stock of foreign liabilities, equivalent to 25% of its GDP.
With the current account deficit now exceeding 5% of GDP, US foreign debt is rising fast.
But no country can accumulate debt forever - and what cannot last sooner or later must end.
In early 1985, when the US current account deficit reached $120 billion, about a third of today's level at current prices, the rest of the world stopped financing it.
The outcome was a sudden fall in the value of the dollar, which depreciated by 50% against the Deutschemark.
Europe should not welcome a sequel.
Indeed, the world itself cannot afford the disappearance of the US current account deficit - at least not quickly.
Take away US imports and the timid growth Europe has seen in the past year would immediately disappear.
This may already be happening: the appreciation of the euro, from $1.20 to $1.30 in the past few months, was enough to bring European growth to a standstill during the third quarter of this year.
Before the dollar started to weaken, exports from the 25 EU member states were growing at 6.5% per year, compared with 2% for consumption and 3% for investment.
Even in Japan, the recent recovery was almost entirely led by exports.
But as the yen strengthens, Japan, too, seems to stop growing.
With central banks around the world full of dollars and trade imbalances becoming worrisome, there are three possible solutions.
One is that domestic saving in the US increases.
But this is unlikely, at least in the near future, given President Bush's ambitious fiscal plans and the continuing war in Iraq.
US private savings are also slightly negative, and an increase might lead to a slowdown in the short run.
The second possibility is a more pronounced devaluation of the dollar, bringing it well beyond the current levels relative to both the euro and the yen.
Revaluation of the Chinese yuan would also help.
The third option is a pick up of growth in Europe, which would increase US exports.
This could happen only if European companies cut costs and increase productivity.
As always, a litany of plans and promises for "structural reforms" can be heard, but none of them is likely to be implemented anytime soon.
So what can be done?
One alternative is to increase working hours without increasing salary per hours proportionally.
Americans and Europeans worked the same number of hours in the early 1970's.
Today, Europeans work 50% less on average in France and Germany than in the US.
This is partly due to higher taxes in Europe, and this cannot be undone: nobody can force someone to work if they consider their take-home pay too low because of a high marginal tax rate.
But the relative decline in work hours is also due to trade unions' success in winning compulsory vacation time.
Labor reform leading to longer hours would not reduce the total income of the employed, but it would reduce production costs.
Some discussion of this idea is beginning to appear in the press and, it is to be hoped, behind close doors among policymakers and union leaders.
Until this happens, it is in the rest of the world's interest to let the US continue to run an unprecedented current account deficit by financing it at the rate of $500 billion per year.
This allows the Chinese to keep their currency stable vis-à-vis the dollar, remain super-competitive, and thus enable a gradual shift of 200 million workers from agriculture into manufacturing, the authorities' aim over the next 10 years.
In Europe, America's external deficit keeps the sole source of growth alive.
But, again, this will not last forever.
Eventually, Europe will have to stop thinking that the US can save its economy and will have to start relying on its own resources.
But don't be surprised if the next European downturn will be blamed on the US and the depreciation of the dollar.
It is always useful to have a scapegoat.
Abba Eban: The Voice of Israel
For almost two generations, Abba Eban was Israel's voice - its messenger to the high and mighty among the nations as well as to the Jewish people all over the world.
Since he first appeared at the side of Dr. Chaim Weizmann in the late 1940's during the struggle for Jewish statehood and sovereignty, few people could articulate the Zionist and later the Israeli case with comparable eloquence and conviction.
With his Churchillian prose and almost Shakespearean cadences, his mellifluous phrases and sonorous voice carried for decades a message of hope from a people that could have lost all hope and trust in humanity after the horrors of World War II.
As Ambassador to the United States and the UN, and later as Foreign Minister, he represented an Israel with which the world's liberal imagination could identify.
Larger and more powerful nations were envious of so a powerful spokesman, and his speeches became textbook models for statesmen and diplomats in distant lands.
His books - which he found time to write despite the hectic demands of diplomacy - were a unique combination of enormous erudition and crystalline clarity.
His scholarly training and rhetorical gifts supplemented each other in a rare fashion.
Rarely has a small country been represented by a statesman of such world stature: only Thomas Masaryk and Jan Smuts come to mind to compare with him.
He was a true patriot, in the old-fashioned sense of the word: proud of his people, but never ethno-centric; a man of the world, but deeply embedded in Jewish cultural heritage; focused on the plights and tribulations of the Jewish people, but never losing the universal horizon of mankind.
In short, he was a modern Jew in the best sense of the word.
It was said of Prime Minister Levi Eshkol that he spoke seven languages, all of them in Yiddish.
Of Eban it could be said that he spoke ten languages, and all of them with an Oxford/Cambridge accent.
Yet what appealed to the outside world was not always an asset in the rough and tumble of Israeli politics.
Perhaps Eban was too urbane, too much of a scholar and gentleman to be able to make it - in Disraeli's phrase - to the top of the greasy pole.
Together with Golda Meir and Moshe Dayan he had to leave government in 1974 in the wake of the Yom Kippur War.
He could hardly have been held responsible for the hubris which led to the avalanche of 1973, yet it nonetheless brought him down as well.
He never found his way back, and when confronted with the New Politics of primaries and populism, he became dispirited when he could not cope with this new style.
In the international arena, Eban's pen was his sword, and the spoken word his lance.
He was less adept in political infighting in Israel.
He could be a fierce turf fighter, yet it is fair to say that he could have fought harder for his moderate and dovish views in the post-1967 government in which he served.
It is far from clear if he would have prevailed, given his lack of an independent political base, but his international prestige and standing might have given him a chance if he would have chosen to throw the gauntlet.
He never did.
Eban's silence in the last years was not only a product of his disenchantment with Israeli politics or his failing health.
At a time when public debate in Israel is torn between pseudo-religious nationalist fanatics and anti-Zionists masquerading as post-modernists, the moral certitudes of Eban, for all their urbanity, may sound shallow.
But nation-building requires moral stamina, and Eban provided it to his people and the world in abundance.
Without having spoken to Eban in the last few years, I have no doubt that he would be extremely unhappy about the turn of events after the failure of Camp David and Taba in 2000-01, and the present course of Israeli policies would fill him with foreboding.
Yet in all probability he would have been even more deeply disappointed in the inability of the Palestinians to come to terms with the existence of the Jewish state.
As an Arabist by training, immersed in Arab and Muslim culture, he always hoped that the glorious Arab past could be rejuvenated, that an Arab and Muslim culture of tolerance could triumph over fanaticism and extremism.
This was the bedrock of his hope for reconciliation between Jew and Arab.
That this Arab renaissance - to use the phrase of the great Palestinian scholar George Antonius - did not take place may have been Eban's greatest disappointment.
Despite the high-born image Eban projected, he was an extremely vulnerable person: what some occasionally discerned as traits of vanity may have had their origins in his humble origins.
While appearing to own the Queen's English, Eban was not to the manor born: he came from the extremely modest fringes of Anglo-Jewry.
He was, in the true sense of the word, a self-made man, whose pluck, ambition, drive and inner belief in his destiny carried him to the pinnacle of his achievements.
His was the aristocracy of the spirit.
In this Abba Eban was a true representative of the people he so gloriously represented.
A Field Guide to Israeli Hawks
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's announcement that he plans to dismantle Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip, as well as some settlements in the West Bank, has shocked and caught people off guard both in Israel and around the world.
Many denounced Sharon's plan as a trick.
But that surprise was wrong-headed from the start.
Despite the way it often looks to outsiders, debates in Israel about the future of the occupied territories have never been confined to hawks and doves.
Like everything in Israel, the process is more complicated, especially where the hawks are concerned.
Basically, there are two species of Israeli hawks: call one kind ideological and the other strategic.
Ideological hawks view the occupied territories as an integral part of the historical Land of Israel, the homeland of the Jewish people.
For them, the territories are part of the Jewish patrimony, which is why they insist on referring to the West Bank by its Hebrew historical appellation - Judea and Samaria.
Not all ideological hawks are religious, although those who are base their claim on divine promises and prophecies.
But many ideological hawks are secular nationalists, and their jargon is similar to that of typical Central and Eastern European nationalists.
Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir belonged to that category.
Ideological hawks usually come from the National-Religious Party and from members of the Likud.
They are inspired by the nationalist ideology connected with Vladimir Jabotinsky, who founded "Revisionist" Zionism as a challenge to the more moderate version espoused by Israel's Founding Fathers like Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion.
Then there are the strategic hawks.
For them, given Israel's narrow and vulnerable geographic shape and continuing Arab enmity, controlling the West Bank and Gaza is not an ideological imperative, but is driven by security considerations.
For them, Jewish settlements in the territories are not a return to historical lands, but security outposts, aimed at preventing - or repelling from a better strategic position - an attack on the Israeli heartland.
They may be right or wrong in this assessment, but it is not an ideological one.
Ariel Sharon, who comes from a military background - he grew up in a social milieu much nearer to Labor than to Jabotinsky's ideas - is a strategic hawk.
For ideological hawks, compromises are treason: how can you jeopardize the historical patrimony of the Jewish people, let alone God's promise to Abraham?
Strategic hawks, however, are open to practical bargains and compromises - if the circumstances are right and if the security considerations justify it in their eyes.
It is in this context that Sharon's moves should be seen.
He was elected on the promise that he would bring peace and security.
He has brought neither.
With the defeat and demise of Saddam Hussein, the danger of an "Eastern front" against Israel has diminished.
Absent a Palestinian partner, and given continuing Palestinian terrorism - which Israel's harsh responses fail to quell - what Sharon appears to be doing now follows from his strategic-oriented thinking: set up an effective barrier, move some of the isolated and strategically untenable settlements, and wait for another day.
If one follows Sharon's statements in the last year, a clear pattern emerges.
First, he admitted that "eventually" a Palestinian state would emerge - something unthinkable for dyed-in-the-wool ideological hawks.
A few months later, he scandalized his own Likud party conference by stating that occupation is wrong and untenable - another shock for those who always speak of "liberated" rather than "occupied" territories.
Last December, he explicitly stated that Israel is headed towards unilateral disengagement, and that this would entail the "relocation" of some settlements.
Although this was still merely verbiage, it was novel language for a Likud prime minister.
Sharon's latest statements, though, explicitly specified the settlements to be evacuated; the Director of the National Security Council, General Giora Eiland, was appointed to chair an inter-ministerial Relocation Committee and work out plans for conducting the evacuations, including compensation for relocated settlers.
All of this has radically altered Israel's domestic political map.
Some ideological hawks in Sharon's government threatened to resign; Shimon Peres announced that Labor will offer Sharon a parliamentary safety net; there is even talk about Labor joining a national unity government.
The test, of course, is not in the planning, but in the implementation of withdrawal, and the road is long and bumpy.
Sharon's timing may have been determined by his problems with police investigations into alleged corruption.
Yet anyone who would like to predict Sharon's future behavior should remember that unlike Begin and Shamir, Sharon comes from the military, and for him security - not ideology - is supreme.
So his apparent pragmatism should come as no surprise.
Victors' Justice, Iraqi-Style
Saddam Hussein is dead, but not all Iraqis are celebrating.
On the contrary, the way in which the various religious and ethnic groups in Iraq responded to his execution is emblematic of the difficulty of holding Iraq together as a coherent entity.
To the Shiite majority, long brutally oppressed by Saddam and all previous Sunni-dominated Iraqi regimes, Saddam's death symbolizes their attainment of political hegemony.
Moreover, their triumphalist rejoicing is a cruel reminder that when the oppressed become liberated, they can very easily turn into oppressors themselves.
To the Sunni minority, pushed from power by the American invasion and giving vent to their frustration with daily attacks on the Shi'a population and their holy sites, Saddam will remain a hero for a long time to come.
The Kurds -- who, like the Shi'a, were victimized by Saddam for decades -- quietly cling to their de facto independence in the north, making sure that they will never again come under Arab rule.
Iraq's prime minister, Nuri el-Maliki, representing the ruling Shi'a-Kurdish coalition, expressed the hope that the dictator's end would help to heal the sectarian divides.
But, however sincere his words may sound, reality is moving in the opposite direction, and the ugly verbal exchanges surrounding the act of execution itself will certainly do little to dispel the notion that this was "victors' justice" -- the victors being not the United States, but the Shi'a.
None of this augurs well for the future of what we should get used to calling "the former Iraq."
Indeed, the Washington debate surrounding how to "fix Iraq" is irrelevant, because something that does not exist any longer -- namely, Iraq as a functioning state -- cannot be fixed.
Under the guise of US-inspired constitutional arrangements, the Shia majority has succeeded in arrogating near-absolute power to itself.
Thus, what only a few months ago had looked from Washington like a successful transition to some sort of representative government is obviously a travesty: just as under Saddam, power today grows out of the barrel of the gun -- only now the state does not hold a monopoly on the means of violence.
Every militia, every ministry, every Shia political faction, has its own guns, goons, and death squads -- while the Sunnis continue to use the stockpiles of weapons they accumulated under Saddam to fight a rear-guard action against the new order, apparently legitimized by elections.
There is no power -- save a new violent dictatorship -- that can bring Shi'a, Sunnis, and Kurds to live once again in one body politic.
America's chimerical dream of democratizing overnight a deeply divided society accustomed only to violence and coercion has unleashed a terrifying array of political demons.
In these circumstances, the post-Baker-Hamilton debate in Washington is largely irrelevant to the future of Iraq -- though it continues to be crucial to the future of US power, prestige, and standing in the world.
The future of Iraq will be decided by the people of Iraq, but with bullets, not ballots.
The US and the entire international community are utterly unequipped to deal with this Middle Eastern version of Yugoslavia and its regional consequences.
And, unlike Yugoslavia's successor states, which could look to Europe, the lack of a legitimate Arab democratic role model makes crafting a democratic order even more difficult.
Some Europeans and others may gloat over America's failure in Iraq, and the ineptness -- or worse -- of US post-occupation policy cries to heaven.
Yet the root causes of that failure go deeper, to Iraq's creation as an artificial entity in the 1920's by British imperialist planners, who stitched together three disparate provinces of the defeated Ottoman Empire into a state that never had a coherent identity.
Indeed, the very foundation of Iraq was based on victors' justice: the British Empire, having vanquished the Ottomans, made the Sunni Arabs overlords in a country in which they were a minority.
That arrangement has now come unglued following another cycle of victors' justice.
The consequences of this re-ordering of power are not yet clear.
But a coherent Iraqi state -- whether unitary, federal, or confederal -- will not grow out of a society in which one part of the population views Saddam, rightly, as a gruesome oppressor, while another part reveres him as a hero and martyr.
Wars always have unintended consequences and cruel ironies.
In Iraq, only now is it becoming evident that some states cannot be saved without being destroyed.
The European Union's Battle for Turkey
When the plotters behind the recent suicide attacks in Istanbul launched their human bombs against Jewish synagogues and British office buildings, they had several audiences in mind.
One audience--and potentially the most important--are the citizens of the European Union, which Turkey's political class is eager to join as soon as possible.
The battle over Turkish membership in the EU will be fought on many fronts: in the country itself, where the government is currently undertaking major reforms in order to qualify for candidate status; at the negotiating table once the European Council in December 2004 authorizes the Commission to enter into formal accession talks; and among the public within the existing member countries.
Of the three fronts, the latter will be the most demanding.
Most EU citizens are uneasy today over the prospect of Turkish membership.
Those responsible for the atrocities in Istanbul may have calculated that Islamic terrorism will increase that uneasiness further.
Traditionally, Europe's citizens have always accepted the new members that queued up to join the club as it went from the original group of six countries to the 25 that will form the EU in 2004.
Once a purely West European community, the Union has pushed out its frontiers in all directions.
From next year, it will stretch from the north of Finland to Cyprus and Malta in the south, from Ireland in the west to the Baltic states in the east.
While the people inside have often worried that newcomers would take away their jobs and subsidies, they usually acquiesced in the end.
But Turkey is different.
The 10 new countries that will join next year--and even the Balkan countries that are now being offered the prospect of future membership--are all embraced by a traditional definition of Europe.
None of them is of a size that could upset the EU's current balance.
Neither applies to Turkey.
Except for a small stretch of land, its territory lies in Asia, not Europe; its culture is Islamic, not Christian, and if it should join in, say, 2013, its population will be by far the largest--and youngest--of any EU member.
Moreover, because Turkey borders on such countries as Iran, Iraq and Syria, it will bring to the EU a disturbing neighborhood: a part of the world incapable of developing a regional order on its own, a cockpit of Islamic radicalism and terrorism, a collection of fragile states imbued with nationalism, a field of competition for arms, even nuclear arms, a region where the US will remain strategically involved and where Israel will continue to provide a rallying point for anti-Western sentiments.
With Turkey as a member, the EU will be part of the troubled and troubling wider Middle East, the most challenging region in today's world.
Yet it is precisely because of these implications that the advantages of having Turkey inside the EU far outweigh the risks.
First and foremost, the prospect of membership is the most powerful force for modernization in Turkey, and a modern, democratic, and prosperous Turkey is of central interest to Europe, whether inside or outside.
Moreover, including within the EU the moderate type of Islam for which Turkey stands will be a major help in integrating Muslim minorities within European countries--already large and growing even without the addition of Turkey's population.
Finally, with the opportunities that Turkey's Islamic traditions, regional contacts, resources, and geography provide, the EU will be much better placed to exert a stabilizing influence on a region that will affect Europe's security in any case.
These are powerful arguments.
The big question is whether they are powerful enough to sway a skeptical European public.
It would take only one country out of perhaps 30 EU members in 2013 to bloc Turkey's accession.
No doubt some of them will put the matter to a referendum that will leave the decision to the people, not just their parliaments.
Even in Germany, where referenda are not envisaged by the constitution, there are calls to hold one over Turkey's entry; one opposition party has already announced that it will make this a central issue in next year's election campaign for the European Parliament.
Once public unease towards Turkey can find focus in a referendum on the country's potential EU membership, the chances for it joining look fairly slim.
At the end of the negotiations it may thus come to pass that Turkey is ready for Europe, but Europe is not yet ready for Turkey.
This is why the battle over Turkish membership has already begun, and the bombers of Istanbul seem to have understood this.
Those who believe that the EU is right for both Turkey and Europe must also start to fight for what they profess.
Nothing would be worse--for both Turkey and Europe--than European governments wanting Turkey in but then failing to take their people along.
Terrorists will no doubt continue to instill fear of an Islamic Turkey among Europe's fainthearted.
Let us hope that in the end, the attacks on innocent people in the crowded streets of Istanbul do not foster European fears, but rather a sense of solidarity with that moderate and dynamic country in the face of a common enemy.
High Fences Make Bad Neighbors in Europe
Good fences make good neighbors, so the poet Robert Frost wrote.
Sadly, the European Union seems to be taking Frost's poetic whimsy as a serious policy prescription.
For how is the EU preparing to welcome the citizens of the ten countries that will become members in May?
Simple: by shutting the door in their faces, and then building regulatory walls to keep them away from the door in the first place.
Indeed, the Union is behaving even worse.
Because no agreement exists at the EU level concerning a common set of rules to be applied to the Union's new citizens, each member country is establishing its own rules without any coordination.
Some of these emerging rules are draconian.
Austria and Germany - so far the two largest recipients of migrants from Eastern Europe, receiving four out of every five - announced last year that they will restrict migration from the new member states for the full transition period of seven years.
France and Belgium will restrict immigration by new EU citizens for at least the first two-years of the transition period.
Sweden initially appeared to take a liberal stance, but is now postponing opening its borders and may tighten migrants' access to welfare benefits.
The Danish government almost collapsed in January when the Ministry of Labor proposed to open the job market to all new EU citizens who can prove that they have found employment.
Greece and Italy have been silent so far, which means that they are likely to keep current restrictions vis-à-vis the new members: they will de facto be treated the same as migrants from outside the EU.
Thus, all the countries bordering the new member states will be closed to migration from the "New Europe."
All this barrier-building reflects mounting public concern about citizens from the new member states emigrating to take advantage of generous welfare systems in the Union.
Little wonder, then, that the largest drops in popular support for enlargement registered by the Eurobarometer Survey occurred in EU countries with the most generous welfare states.
But support for enlargement is fading everywhere, right on the brink of accession.
At the same time, closing the doors to the Union's newest citizens will not solve the problem of welfare access and will certainly hurt economic growth.
In EU labor markets characterized by low mobility, such as those that exist across Western and Southern Europe, migrants can play a very important role.
By increasing average productivity, they contribute not only to stronger growth, but also to achieving higher incomes per capita.
In fact, due to distortions in how wages are set-often set irrespective of local labor productivity rates-migrants can even contribute to reducing unemployment in Western and Southern Europe.
Moreover, shutting the door will not solve the problem of welfare access, because illegal migration is worse than legal migration: it draws resources without contributing anything to finance the welfare state even though most migrants are young and do work.
A better way to deal with the fear of migrants abusing social welfare systems would be to adopt a common and rather generous transitional quota at the level of the EU as a whole, to be lifted early if it is not filled.
Migration quotas should be preferred to other types of restrictions on the ground that they allow at least a part of the potential welfare gains from migration to be realized.
Quotas could be established at levels set on the basis of past periods of high migration - say, an annual flow of 400,000 people to the EU.
While these transitional restrictions are put in place, reforms should be undertaken that address the underlying basis for the public's fear of migration.
The root of this fear, of course, is the vast differences in income between citizens of, say, Lithuania, and those of most of the Union.
Of course, economic convergence is a long-term business.
Thus, redistributive policies in the EU should be reformed in ways that discourage "welfare shopping" by citizens of its poorest member states.
Here the problem is the incompatibility of insurance schemes, on the one hand, in which the benefits that people receive are based on what they have contributed, and, on the other hand, social assistance programs that entail cash transfers.
All EU countries, including the new members, should be encouraged to adapt social assistance schemes (which also exist in the new member states) so as to meet some basic income requirements.
EU-wide coordination of these minimum guaranteed income schemes should be gradually pursued, with the long-term intention of building up a pan-European safety net as one of the institutional pillars of the EU.
Calderon's Cauldron
Under dramatically inauspicious circumstances, Mexico has finally got itself a new president last Friday.
Felipe Calderón has taken the oath of office, braving the wrath of his left-wing opposition, out-smarting the Partido de la Revolución Democrática (PRD) and its leader, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, but nonetheless paying a high price.
Every TV news show and front-page headline in the world ran the same headline: "New Mexican President inaugurated in chaos and fisticuffs."
Mexico's institutions withstood -- just barely -- the onslaught of a virtually insurrectional left-wing opposition, bent in vain on stopping Calderón's inauguration, and of a resentful Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI), increasingly dedicated to allowing Calderón to take office, and then fail miserably.
Calderón impressively overcame apparently insurmountable obstacles on the way to the presidency, yet the struggle to govern and transform Mexico has just begun.
Most Mexican commentators believe that it should be relatively easy for Calderón to improve on the largely self-inflicted failure of outgoing President Vicente Fox's term.
Mexico needs to grow at roughly twice the rate that it did under Fox (a meager 2% per year).
If Calderón can strengthen law and order, and use his considerable political skills to reach agreement with the PRI on structural economic reforms, he will succeed.
But this view is simplistic.
Fox's term, along with the four last years of former President Ernesto Zedillo's mandate, were hardly a failure.
Not since the 1960's had Mexico undergone ten consecutive years of economic stability, low inflation, low interest rates, a stable currency, and constant, though mediocre growth.
For the first time ever, mortgages, automobile loans, and consumer credit became available to the lower middle class: this year more homes were built and sold, and more cars were bought, than ever before.
Likewise, while Fox can be criticized for not clamping down on protesters and a disruptive, extremist opposition, he never resorted to the bloody repression for which most of his predecessors came to be known.
Moreover, he dragged Mexico out of its archaic foreign policy cocoon, and placed immigration and human rights at the heart of Mexico's new international agenda.
Nor is Calderón finding it easy to negotiate with the PRI, failing to build a coalition government, which he has repeatedly proclaimed as the solution to the gridlock that has cursed Mexico since 1997.
Whatever the advantages of a cabinet comprising solely members of his Partido Acción Nacional (PAN), this is not what Calderón sought.
Similarly, no deal with the opposition was possible regarding the inauguration ceremony -- thus the chaotic, depressing scenes of congressmen fighting it out in their chamber, while Calderón was ushered in through the back door for a rushed ceremony.
Mexico's economic problems might be similarly more intractable than many commentators seem to believe.
Mexico experienced a "cold-turkey" economic opening under former President Carlos Salinas in 1988-1994; a belated but successful political opening under former President Zedillo in 1994-2000; and, at long last, a true rotation in power thanks to Fox.
But the foundations of the old PRI-corporativist system created in the 1930's remain untouched, and represent the main and most formidable obstacles to Mexico's growth and success.
The first pillar of this system is the public and private economic monopolies that dominate the country.
The state-owned oil (Pemex) and electric power (Federal Electricity Commission) companies face no competition.
The private virtual monopolies in telecommunications (Telmex), television (Televisa), cement (Cemex), bread and tortilla manufacturing (Bimbo and Maseca, respectively), banking (Banamex/Citigroup and Bancomer/Banco de Bilbao) may face competition abroad, but not at home.
These monopolies are stronger than ever, and prices, supply, service, and quality all suffer.
The second pillar is formed by the unions that have controlled the Mexican labor movement since the 1930's.
They enjoy "closed shop" hiring and firing prerogatives, leadership elections by acclamation, mandatory dues without transparency, and immense political power.
The teachers' union is the largest in Latin America, the oil workers' union is the richest in Latin America, and the social security employees union has thwarted any attempt at pension or health reform for years.
The third pillar of the system is political monopoly.
For 70 years, the PRI had a complete lock on Mexican politics; now three parties do, and no one else can enter the political arena or gain access to the enormous public subsidies -- more than $500 million last year -- handed out to these parties without their consent.
The main parties write their own anti-trust legislation, vote their own subsidies, and choose their own elected officials.
The absence of consecutive re-election at any level reinforces the party machines' power: they pick candidates, whom voters merely ratify at the polls.
So Mexico's challenges boil down to liberating the labor movement, breaking up the private monopolies and opening the public monopolies to competition, and lowering entry barriers that restrict access to the political arena.
These may not be sufficient conditions for success, but they are certainly necessary ones.
Calderón must strengthen his presidency from the outset.
Taking on the powers that be is perhaps the only way to achieve this, however risky it might appear.
Elected with only 35% of the vote, lacking a majority in Congress, and taking office on the eve of an economic slowdown in the United States, things would be difficult anyway.
Given that roughly a third of the electorate does not think he won fairly, and in view of the precariousness of the rule of law in the country, Calderón's position is even less enviable.
Caution and patience might not be his best advisors.
The Chávez Challenge
Venezuela's recent legislative elections confirmed trends that have repeatedly brought the country into the headlines in recent years.
President Hugo Chávez showed once again that he enjoys broad support among the nation's poor and desperate, and that he is miles ahead of his opposition in terms of political skill, cunning, and ruthlessness.
Yet at the same time voter turnout is declining with each passing election under Chávez, and the questionable fairness of the electoral process has grown increasingly apparent.
To be sure, the opposition's withdrawal from the election just days before the vote was, as Chávez claimed, more a symptom of its own weakness than of problems with the electoral process.
And, just as surely, that very weakness is a function of the gradual stifling of many features of Venezuela's traditional democratic order.
Even so, the opposition's mistakes have been massive, ranging from support for the failed coup against the democratically elected Chávez in April 2002 to the failed strike at PEDEVSA, Venezuela's national oil company, in early 2003.
Nothing is more lethal in politics than failure in direct confrontation.
In such circumstances, Chávez can afford to be bold, despite his policies' failure to benefit his core constituency: the more than 50% of Venezuelans who live in destitution and despair.
Poverty has grown since Chávez took office in 1998; government finances and the trade balance are more dependent on oil revenues than before, and, aside from Cuban literacy programs and neighborhood "barefoot doctor" services, the overall welfare of the poor remains the same, if not worse.
Major changes are unlikely in the foreseeable future.
Chávez will be able to modify the Constitution largely as he pleases, and pack both the justice system and the electoral authority with his placemen.
He will continue to dole out oil-based subsidies in the well-worn Venezuelan tradition of Marcos Pérez Jiménez and Carlos Andrés Pérez.
As a result, Chávez will be re-elected late next year, and he may well remain in power until the end of the next decade.
Yet, if this is what the Venezuelan people want, then so be it.
It is, after all, their business who governs them, and how, as long as human rights are not systematically violated, democratic institutions are not indefinitely suspended, and standard norms of international conduct are respects.
Judged by the last standard, at least, Chávez may have crossed the line.
For years, he has been accused of taking over where Fidel Castro left off: supporting the rhetoric of radicalism and anti-imperialism, if not revolution, throughout Latin America.
It could now be time for other Latin American nations and the international community to take such charges more seriously.
Chávez is giving away oil to Caribbean island nations and Cuba, and buying off Argentine debt to help President Nestor Kirchner's political fortunes.
In Mar del Plata, Argentina, last month, he openly participated in a rally against the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), in the company of, among others, Evo Morales, the coca-leaf growers' leader from Bolivia who might well become that country's next president.
Similarly, Chávez is clearly supporting Daniel Ortega, the perennial Sandinista presidential candidate in Nicaragua, and Shafick Handal, the equally perennial FMLN candidate in El Salvador.
His former ambassador to Mexico participated openly and vociferously in campaign events for Mexico City Mayor Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador's presidential campaign.
There seems to be a common thread to most of Chávez's foreign policy: to provoke a major confrontation with the United States.
The danger, of course, is that if and when confrontation comes -- over Bolivia, the FTAA, human rights, or press freedoms -- it will be too late to defuse it.
The challenge, then, lies in avoiding a confrontation that Chávez clearly wants.
Unfortunately, George W. Bush's administration has not proved particularly adept at conflict prevention.
The hemisphere's other nations have a direct stake in attempting to pre-empt a fight that would force them to take sides and might threaten their economic and national-security interests.
Although many of Chávez's positions have found support in certain Latin American nations, the division that he and Castro's Cuba have created in Latin America -- between left and right, free-traders and "Bolivarians," and pro- and anti- Americans -- is mainly artificial and certainly not impossible to overcome.
To be sure, many Latin American leaders have tried to assuage and control Chávez, and they have all failed.
But the cost of not trying again could be extremely high.
The last time revolutionary leaders confronted the US head-on, in Central America during the 1980's, everyone lost.
A new split up and down the hemisphere, engineered by a leader awash in oil money, would prove far more disastrous.
Should We Affirm Affirmative Action?
Equal rights for all citizens are fundamental to a liberal order.
Such rights offer opportunities for political participation, to form associations, and to speak one's mind.
But they also open doors to economic participation, and doors to participation in social institutions like education.
Constitutional guarantees of these rights are the great achievement of the long battle for citizenship that marked the last two centuries.
However, such legal guarantees of rights are often insufficient.
Even the right to vote means little for someone who is totally dependent on other people or institutions.
Equality before the law remains an empty promise for those who cannot afford to make use of it or simply do not know how to do so.
The civil right to an education according to talent requires encouragement of many kinds.
Thus, one great theme of social progress in the last century was to imbue the abstract concept of equal rights with social substance.
This meant active encouragement by information, by political education, for example.
As far as education was concerned, it often meant committing resources to financial assistance for students, such as subsidized loans or scholarships.
Yet when all this was done, certain stubborn obstacles to equal participation remained.
Major groups remained underrepresented among societies' most successful citizens.
This was notably the case for women and for some cultural minorities, especially if these were defined by unchosen "ascriptive" characteristics, such as skin color.
Few people from these groups were found among senior managers, government ministers, professors, doctors, and lawyers, so that the suspicion grew that there are largely invisible barriers blocking access to such positions.
Perhaps entrenched institutional cultures militated against women or black people.
Wanting real citizenship for all meant that more had to be done than offering legal guarantees, information, or even financial support.
It was a courageous step, first taken in the United States, to decide that at least for a while a new kind of policy was needed to remedy long-term injustices. Affirmative action , as it was called, consisted of rules that set aside a certain percentage of representation among candidates for office, students and teachers, police and the military, and in other walks of life to members of hitherto disadvantaged groups.
The US Supreme Court became the guardian of affirmative action.
Wherever it was seriously tried, affirmative action undoubtedly had some success.
This is notably the case in countries that were once homogeneous but now have to deal with citizens who are black or Muslim or are otherwise in an identifiable and neglected minority position.
But at the very moment that other countries were looking to America for a policy model, affirmative action began to raise questions, of which three are particularly important.
First, is there not a risk of a kind of inverted injustice by which the traditionally privileged become the new underprivileged?
The US Supreme Court confronted this question when it first dealt with the case of a white student who was not admitted to medical school despite having better academic qualifications than other applicants.
In Britain, children in private schools must now fear to be at a disadvantage because of the pressure on universities to admit more students from state schools.
This takes us back to the old and vexing question: can we be equal and excellent too?
Second, is equal representation at all levels really what all groups want or need?
After all, the "feminization" of the teaching profession in many countries has not done any harm.
Many countries have benefited from the entrepreneurialism of their Chinese or Jewish minorities.
Are we perhaps pursuing too mechanical an ideal which confuses the absence of privilege and disadvantage with the absence of diversity?
Third, is affirmative action in some cases producing a new kind of rigid segmentation that destroys the very civil society it was intended to create?
Are women, for example, always the best defenders of women's interests?
The same question can be raised for members of religious groups and ethnic minorities, or even of certain social classes.
One shudders to think of parliaments in which the main criterion of membership is to belong to a group in need of affirmative action.
Indeed, in some countries, democracy fails to deliver imaginative and effective governance because the main objective seems to be to have all major groups on board.
To repeat the earlier point: affirmative action was and is a courageous final step in the fight for universal citizenship rights - not just on paper, but in reality.
But affirmative action must not become an enduring principle of a liberal order.
If any set of rules needs a "sunset clause" to enforce review after a specific and limited period, it is affirmative action.
The flexibility of the US Supreme Court in this regard is admirable.
Elsewhere it is probably best to include in the laws of countries and the statutes of organizations a clause that makes affirmative action lapse after five years, or at most ten.
Such a clause could be renewed, but there is nothing so effective as a firm deadline to force a thorough review and concentrate minds.
The Nation State Revisited
It has become fashionable to claim that the nation state has lost its place.
Globalization, it is said, means that nations can no longer control their own affairs.
They must join with others, as in the European Union or ASEAN or Mercosur, and they must increasingly rely on global institutions like the United Nations, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization.
But such a view is risky.
Indeed, on closer inspection, it proves to be dubious, when not simply wrong.
The nation state, with both its strengths and weaknesses, is alive and well.
To begin with its strengths, the nation state remains the only political space in which the constitution of liberty thrives.
The democratic credentials of organizations like the EU are doubtful, and entirely absent in the case of the UN and other world institutions.
Moreover, despite the frequent search for new identities, European or Latin American or otherwise, and despite many references to a new cosmopolitanism, or even a "world civil society," most people feel at home in their own country -- the nation state of which they are citizens.
Migration is generally migration to other countries.
Many countries are currently debating the integration of migrants.
What does it take to be British or German or American?
Such debates about immigration make sense only if we recognize that citizenship is defined by and for nations.
This is, for most people, the positive side of the nation state.
The nation state has been, and continues to be, the relevant unit of belonging and civic involvement for most human beings for more than two centuries.
It is the context in which we find our liberties safeguarded or destroyed.
Certainly, the countries freed from communism in 1989 felt that restoring national sovereignty and recovering liberty were bound together.
Yet there is, and always has been, another, uglier face of the nation state: nationalism.
The nationalist impulse can be aggressive or defensive, directed against others or inward-looking.
Either way, it vitiates all attempts to create an international community of open societies.
This was the problem in Iraq: a nation state had become a disturber of peace in the region and beyond.
More recently, a less violent but equally worrying phenomenon has gained ground, the revival of national protectionism.
The Doha Round of trade negotiations is stalled because developed countries do not want to open their markets to cheaper products from developing countries, which in turn try to protect what nascent industries they have.
Many would prefer privileged relationships to open trade.
In this regard, the EU has often obliged.
But now the nationalist bug has infected the EU itself.
France, Spain, and Poland have attempted to keep major industries firmly in "national hands."
Suddenly, the single European market is forgotten, and a return to fragmented markets is taking root.
Consider, for example, the European Commission's so-called "services directive."
Although freedom of movement for labor is one of the single market's "four freedoms," many EU countries are trying to protect their domestic labor markets by suspending this freedom for as long as possible.
Germany, in particular, argues that the high unemployment resulting from reunification in 1990 requires it to close its labor market to the new member states to its east.
Such trends are dangerous.
Historically, protectionism has often led to economic conflict, which can rapidly turn into more serious clashes.
The signs are not good, even in Europe.
A recent summit of EU leaders addressed energy policy -- one area where cooperation is not only highly desirable, but necessary.
Yet even German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- clearly a pro-European -- went to the meeting with the explicit intention of barring the creation of other European powers in this field.
The German-Russian agreement to build a gas pipeline bypassing Poland and Lithuania, with former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder leading the effort, has already harmed Polish-German relations, to say nothing of European cooperation.
For a time, the pendulum of political opinion may have swung too far against the nation state and its role.
This is one reason why so many people have felt estranged from their political leaders.
But it would be unfortunate -- indeed, dangerous -- if the pendulum now swung back to old-fashioned nationalism.
Nation states are welcome; they are important elements of a liberal world order.
But they have to be open to cooperation and coordination with others.
We must be vigilant in resisting the start of a trend reminiscent of developments in the early years of the twentieth century ­­ -- a trend that quickly led to global disaster.
Is Gordon Brown Electable?
Gordon Brown obviously wants to succeed Tony Blair as British prime minister.
But it is less obvious that he is willing to do what is necessary to lead the Labour Party to victory in the next general election.
In some critical sense, he must repudiate Blair's legacy, which, at a minimum, means promising to take Britain out of the Iraq War.
Brown has longed to be prime minister ever since May 12, 1994, the fateful day when John Smith, the Labour Party's leader in opposition, dropped dead of a heart attack.
Two weeks later, on May 31, Blair and Brown met in a small restaurant in North London, and debated who should take over the party leadership.
By the end of their discussion, they had made a double deal: Brown would stand aside and support Blair as the next party leader; in return, Blair would later give up the leadership to him.
Crucially, but inevitably, they did not agree when, or under what circumstances, Blair would fulfil his side of the bargain.
Inevitably, they could not foresee that Blair would go on to win an unprecedented three successive election victories for Labour, in 1997, 2001, and 2005, and thus keep Labour in power for a record-breaking period of possibly as long as 13 years.
The key challenge for New Labour (as Blair re-styled it with his characteristic gift for spin), was the management of the British economy.
Since World War II, most British governments tried to manipulate the economy for short-term party advantage, usually with disastrous long-term results.
This lamentable tradition was common to both Conservatives and Labour; and yet, unfairly, it was the Labour Party that was most contaminated by the smear that it could not be trusted to manage the economy.
Brown decisively changed that reputation.
He has been probably the most outstanding Chancellor of the Exchequer in British history, not because of any inspiration or genius, but simply because he has built on a new tradition of prioritizing low inflation, low interest rates, and stable government finances.
Brown understood that these priorities were essential, not just for the British economy, but also for the long-term prospects of Labour in power; and he entrenched this agenda by giving the Bank of England independent responsibility for keeping inflation low.
As a result, Britain has had an unprecedented decade of low inflation and relatively high economic growth, outperforming many of its European counterparts.
Yet, despite economic success, it became steadily clearer that Blair's time was running out.
The electorate grew increasingly disillusioned with the unavoidable shortcomings of an over-familiar government, and the party grew increasingly discontented with a leader who had outstayed his welcome.
At first, Blair thought that he could claim the right to remain in power for a third full five-year term.
But the pressure on him to go has steadily risen, to the point where he has now almost promised to give up in the summer of 2007.
But no one knows exactly when, or how, Blair will step down.
If there is a formal leadership contest, it seems likely that several rival candidates will aim to stand.
But almost all authoritative observers seem to agree that Brown is by far the most likely man to be the next Labour prime minister.
That is the easy part.
From that point on, no one seems certain whether Brown knows what to do, or has what it takes, to fight and win another general election for Labour.
His reputation for command and control of the economy is magisterial and unchallenged, but he has given almost no clue as to what he thinks of other government policies.
He has remained dour and almost silent, visibly chafing with impatience to come into his inheritance, but offering no hint of what difference he would make when he does.
The one thing he cannot do is promises to continue Blair's policies.
If Brown offers more of the same, he will lose.
After ten years of Blair, he must offer one or more policies that mark a clear break.
The most obvious candidate for such a policy switch is Iraq: if Brown wants to win an election as Labour leader, he must renounce Blair's policy and announce the withdrawal, in short order, of British troops.
In tactical terms, this should be easy and obvious: whatever the deceitful and illegal reasons originally given for invading Iraq, everyone now knows that this war has proved a political, strategic, and moral catastrophe.
Everyone knows that it cannot be "won," whatever that means, and Brown knows that both the war and Britain's servile subordination to the Bush administration are deeply unpopular in Britain.
This is the issue that is crying out to be addressed: but so far none of the main political parties has dared touch it.
In the past three weeks, Labour, the Liberal Democrats, and the Conservatives have all held their annual conferences.
All of them concentrated on domestic policies; none dared discuss Iraq, because they all know that to do so would raise the question of withdrawal, which in turn would unleash a major and possibly explosive debate about Britain's relationship with the US.
Does Brown have the stomach to take on the risks involved in confronting the Iraq question?
Possibly not.
He may decide that it is too difficult, in which case he will be a lame duck prime minister, condemned to serve out the three years remaining in Labour's current term with no hope of winning the next election.
That is not what he planned when he struck his bargain with Blair back in 1994.
The New New Thing in Economics
The Great Depression brought John Maynard Keynes to the forefront of economic thought.
The key "Keynesian" insight was that private investment spending is inherently unstable--due to fads and fashions among investors, or because of shifts in the "animal spirits" of businessmen, or because falling prices disrupt the financial system.
Keynesians thought that prudent monetary policy--central banks raising and lowering interest rates to diminish fluctuations in private investment spending--could go part of the way toward stabilizing the economy.
But they also believed that government had to be willing to step in directly, through expansive fiscal policy, to keep the overall level of spending in an economy stable.
Such a policy, they believed, would forever banish the specter of large-scale mass unemployment, as in the Great Depression.
Moreover, near-full employment might effectively be guaranteed.
The Keynesians foresaw that near-full employment raised the threat of inflation.
After all, why should workers and unions moderate wage demands if governments will boost spending whenever high unemployment looms?
One big curb on high wage demands--fear of being let go when unemployment rises--was gone.
What would replace it?
For the first post-1945 generation, the predominant answer was that corporatist social democracy would replace it.
Unions would bow to government requests to moderate their demands for wage increases, and governments would bow to union demands for public spending and social insurance.
Keynesian thinking guaranteed that nothing like the Great Depression would ever return.
But its solution to the problem of creeping inflation was jury-rigged, and broke down completely in the 1970's.
In the aftermath of the main industrial countries' burst of inflation in the 1970's, mainstream economic thought in the world's industrial core shifted into a "semi-Monetarist" channel.
Milton Friedman's victory was never as complete as the Keynesians' had been.
But by the mid-1980's policymakers throughout the world were assenting to the following propositions:
Central banks must make their commitments to long-run price stability credible;
Central banks must accept that the average level of unemployment is determined not by cyclical factors, but by "structural" factors, which they have no business trying to address;
Announcing and trying to maintain a money-supply growth target is an easy way for a central bank to communicate its principal intentions, gain credibility, and give outsiders a way to check whether sound policies are really being followed.
Monetarism was the mirror image of Keynesianism.
It seemingly guaranteed that nothing like the inflation of the 1970's would ever return.
But it offered no solution to the problem of structural unemployment that arose in western Europe.
The past decade and a half demonstrated that monetarism is as ill-equipped to deal with the challenges of falling prices in the context of highly-leveraged firms and banks as the Keynesian prescription was ill-equipped to deal with the challenges of inflation.
Back in the 1970's and at the start of the 1980's, many (I was one) blamed bad decisions for the breakdown of the social-democratic systems' ability to control inflation.
Politicians did not understand that expanding social insurance was the inevitable price of wage restraint, while union leaders did not understand that if corporatist social democracy did not restrain inflation, political power would shift to the right and high unemployment would be used to restrain it.
Today, many blame today's alarming economic conditions in the world's industrial core--more than a decade of stagnation in Japan, deflation there and in Germany, recession in Germany--on other bad decisions.
Japanese and European central bankers did not lower interest rates far enough fast enough, banking-sector regulators shied at the jump in speculative lending, and politicians were unwilling to expand fiscal policy sufficiently.
But politicians and central bank governors cannot always be expected to make good decisions: good policies must be designed to function even when rulers are short-sighted and badly advised.
The inflation of the 1970's was a natural failure of Keynesian political economy.
The deflation that threatens Japan, Europe, and perhaps the US with the prospect of a long period of large gaps between potential and actual output is a natural failure of the semi-Monetarist orthodoxy that governed macroeconomic policy in the world's industrial core since the early 1980's.
Round and round we go.
But it's not quite a circle: no government would allow a repeat of the liquidity collapse seen in the 1930's, or the failure of banks and companies on a scale that puts the entire financial system at hazard.
It is an upward spiral.
The world's macroeconomic problems are real, but they will not lead to another Great Depression--in large part because policymakers remember that there once was a Great Depression.
We need another policy-making revolution like the Keynesian and semi-Monetarist ones, a revolution that will not (wholly) lose sight of its predecessor's achievements, but will eliminate its natural failures.
Where might that revolution come from?
Perhaps the next revolution in economics will grow out of US Federal Reserve Governor Ben Bernanke's career-long concern with asset prices, the role of adverse selection in credit markets, and the need for central banks in difficult situations to do more than conduct short-term open-market operations.
He believes that banks should try things like putting a floor beneath key long-term bond prices.
Bernankeism, anyone?
Man's Fate/Man's Hope
For quite a while now—certainly since the terrorist attacks on the US of September 11, 2001, and before as we watched the slaughters in Kosovo, Sarajevo, Srebrenica, Rwanda, and Congo on our televisions—the news has been dominated by war and rumors of war, by violent death and threats of violent death.
Everyone, everywhere is keenly aware of the power of our weapons.
From nuclear-tipped missiles down to trucks full of fertilizer or explosives worn as belts, we have used our technology to amplify greatly the dark parts of our nature as a violent—and not even a properly predatory—species.
I certainly do not want to downplay or dismiss this side of humanity's history and our current events.
I do not want anyone to forget that over less than half of the years contained in the past century—from the outbreak of World War I to the famine that followed Mao's "Great Leap Forward"—about one in every ten people alive on this planet was shot, gassed, stabbed, burned, or starved to death by his or her fellow human beings.
But that is not the whole story.
Indeed, the human abattoirs of the twentieth century—and even the slaughterhouses that various humans are preparing now—may not appear from the perspective of the future to be the most important part of our experience and condition, and of what our descendants will regard as their history.
For them, the most important features of what our experience may instead be:
·
·
For most of the twentieth century, large chunks of the world remained desperately poor for one or more of four related reasons: (1) criminal misgovernment; (2) lack of the machines to do anything useful and productive in the world economy besides subsistence agriculture and unskilled service work; (3) lack of the public education system needed to give people the literacy and the skills to operate the machines; and (4) barriers (legal and physical) that kept people where demand was low from selling the products of their work where demand was high.
But over the course of the late twentieth century, these four causes of desperate poverty have largely fallen away.
Governments as bad as Kim Jong-Il's in North Korea are now extremely rare.
Nearly all countries in the world are at most one generation away from near-universal literacy.
The fast pace of technological progress has created a cornucopia of invention and innovation that is open to every place that can send someone away to get a master's degree in engineering.
Most important, the barriers to making goods and services in Mauritius, Mozambique, or Mauritania and selling them in New York or Berlin, Santiago or Tokyo are dropping swiftly.
The gargantuan container ships that first appeared a generation ago brought one revolution to world trade.
The use of information technology to manage transportation and distribution channels is likely to have a similarly profound effect.
Moreover, the advent of the Internet and the fiber-optic cable will do as much to make service-sector work internationally tradable as the coming of the iron-hulled steamship a century and a half ago did to make bulk agricultural products and manufactures internationally tradable.
It will take at least a generation for these changes to make themselves felt in most corners of the world.
But inside the industrial core of the world's rich countries there is already concern about these looming revolutions.
Indeed, this concern will only become sharper and stronger, as citizens in rich countries fear that as the remaining barriers to international trade fall, industrial-core income distributions, social orders, and politics will be shaken to their foundations.
For the world as a whole, however, the next two generations are ones that will bring an extraordinary opportunity for economic growth and world prosperity.
Perhaps at the end of history there is a pot of gold, after all.
Neo-liberalism's Argentine Failure
In the 1990s Argentina implemented perhaps 80% of the neoliberal economic policy agenda.
It opened up its economy to world trade and international capital; it sought to guarantee low inflation and sound money.
It strove to improve its legal system so that decisions would accord with general rules and foster confidence that contracts would be enforced--whether or not a bribe had been paid.
It failed.
This is not to say that the 1990s, even with their aftermath leading into the terrible summer of 2002, were catastrophic.
Life was clearly worse during the Dirty War of the 1970s, when an army with no honor threw women out of helicopters into the South Atlantic, and urban guerrillas shot people because... because... well, just because!
The 1980s were hardly better.
Starting with a full-fledged debt crisis triggered by a massive rise in both US interest rates and the value of the American dollar, the decade ended with domestically-generated hyperinflation, causing Argentina to fall a decade further behind the world's leading economies.
In the 1990s, by contrast, Argentina's GDP per capita grow by 25% from trough to peak--only to lose this entire income gain over the past four years.
Until late last winter, Argentina's problems seemed merely an unpleasant but temporary bump, in the same way that the 1994-1995 Mexican "tequila" crisis or the East Asian crises of 1997-1998 proved to be only temporary interruptions, not watersheds.
Such optimism is impossible today, and there is little hope that the country's recent meltdown is only temporary.
The establishment view--say, in US Treasury Undersecretary John Taylor's office--is that Argentina's collapse is the fault of its politicians.
I half-agree with this view.
Argentine leaders were repeatedly warned that keeping the exchange rate constant and fixing the peso's value against the US dollar risked sending the economy into recession if the dollar gained value.
Argentine politicians were also warned that their peso policy could not be sustained unless the ratio of national debt to GDP was falling.
Yet during the boom years of 1993-1998, public spending outran taxes enough to push Argentina's debt-to-GDP ratio from 29 to 44%.
When the dollar appreciated and recession came, politicians with too little statesmanship to balance the budget in good times turned out to have too little courage to balance the budget when times turned hard.
The coup de grâce was delivered by the government's decision (when the crisis came) to keep bank deposits fixed in dollars and to change debts owed to banks into pesos, thereby bankrupting the country's financial system with a single stroke of the pen.
The establishment position is that if any of these three disastrous policies had not been implemented, Argentina would not have fallen into crisis, or at worst it would have suffered a small tequila-style crisis.
Argentina's 1990's neo-liberal program was nearly idiot-proof, according to this view, but Argentine politicians turned out to form a large and ingenious class of idiots.
There is, however, another way of looking at the Argentine tragedy.
It is based on the observation that the country's political system has long performed in a predictable way, consistently producing governments that promise more than they can deliver.
They promise rich oligarchs that they will not collect much in taxes.
They promise workers and consumers generous social insurance.
They promise rapid economic development, generous infrastructure spending, cushy low-work jobs for the politically connected, and so forth.
Taken together, these promises mean that claims on national product always exceed 100% of the total.
Popular demands that the government fulfills all of them cannot possibly be met.
Add to this an unfair distribution of income and wealth, lack of social comity between the working and middle classes, and a long tradition of political violence, and you have the recipe for a politics of all-against-all.
The basic political fight about how wealth should be distributed in Argentina remains unresolved.
Any political force that tries to curb the bidding by promising only what it can deliver is doomed to defeat.
So in Argentina big government deficits are a law of nature, a fact of life.
Hence Argentine interest rates can be low and affordable only for rare, short periods.
Everyone knew that Argentina's political system generates chronic deficits, and this meant that interest payments on the debt were likely to explode.
Because the dynamics of Argentine debt were so unstable, a hard-currency exchange-rate peg could not last.
Free access to international capital markets and dollar-denominated bank accounts meant that when the exchange-rate peg finally collided with the deficit-producing logic of Argentine politics, the result could be nothing short of catastrophic.
Had today's crisis been finessed, had Argentina another decade of rapid growth, its conflicts over wealth distribution might have moderated.
After all, Europe before WWII possessed the nastiest politics on earth: rioting right-wing mobs in France, general strikes in Britain, civil war in Spain, fascism in Italy, and the Nazis' vicious consolidation of power in Germany.
Yet postwar Western Europe encountered no public problems that could not be resolved in ways that preserved sound money and growth.
I half-agree with this view, too.
Yes, Argentina's government made huge mistakes; its politicians sinned against the gods of monetary economics.
But did the punishment need to be so swift and so severe?
The False Promise of Private Pensions
One of the strangest claims made in the debates about social insurance now roiling the world's richest countries is the that government-funded defined-benefit pension programs (such as America's Social Security system) are outmoded.
These programs were fine, the argument goes, for the industrial economy of the Great Depression and the post-World War II generation, but they have become obsolete in today's high-tech, networked, post-industrial economy.
Advocates of this argument propose a different model.
Just as corporations today are much happier supporting workers' pensions by contributing to employees' private accounts, so governments today should offer (or require) contributions to privately owned accounts.
The value of these accounts would fluctuate with the market rather than resting on a defined-benefit scheme that guarantees a fixed real sum of resources available upon retirement.
This argument is strange because it gets the economics of the situation backward.
When there are lots of companies offering workers long-term defined-benefit retirement pensions, there are fewer advantages to the government in setting up a parallel defined-benefit scheme and requiring workers to participate in it.
After all, in such a world, workers who set great value on a defined-benefit pension can go to work for firms that offer such pensions.
The major benefits that arise from the government's requiring that workers also participate in a national Social Security system accrue to those workers who really ought to value a defined-benefit pension highly but have not been able to figure out what their true preferences are.
They also accrue to relatively poor workers who lack the bargaining power to induce bosses to offer the pensions they really want -- and need.
But there aren't a lot of companies today that are willing to offer long-term defined-benefit pension schemes.
One reason is that companies nowadays are much more aware of their own long-run fragility than they were in the post-World War II decades.
Not even America's IBM -- which prides itself on stability -- wants to take the risk of offering defined-benefit schemes.
The risk from defined-benefit pensions used to be offset by two benefits for companies that offered them.
First, the fact that leaving the company usually meant cashing in one's pension at a discount increased worker loyalty.
Second, complaisant accountants' optimistic assumptions about returns on pension reserves, together with large firms' greater risk-bearing capacity, brightened the financial picture that companies could report to investors.
Today, the risks are seen to be much greater, and the benefits are seen to be less.
As a result, an ever-smaller slice of employers are offering anything like defined-benefit pensions.
This fall-off in private defined-benefit pensions all across the rich core of the world economy is a bad thing, because the configuration of asset prices suggests that young and middle-aged workers value defined-benefit pensions extremely highly.
Historically, the gap between expected returns on low-risk assets like government or investment-grade bonds and high-risk assets like stocks and real estate has been very high.
To some degree, as economists like Harvard's Robert Barro and mathematicians like Benoit Mandelbrot argue, this may be because high-risk investments are in reality much more risky than the theories and math of standard finance techniques suggest.
In my opinion, at least, this is partly because the memory of years like 1930 and 2000, when stocks performed very badly, occupies too large a place in investors' minds.
Workers and other asset holders place a very high value on safety, security, and predictability, so a defined-benefit pension plan is extremely valuable.
But in today's world, only national governments are large enough to be able to do so with any assurance that the pension assets will actually be there when workers retire.
I am enough of a social democrat to believe that if there is an economic service or benefit that citizens value extremely highly and that only the government can provide, then the government should provide it.
We economists know that there are many drawbacks to expanding government beyond its basic role of providing true public goods like defense, public safety, and justice, as well as providing citizens with incentives to counterbalance the effects of true market failures.
If the private market has the flexibility of two hands, government bureaucracy has at best two thumbs.
But the collection of payroll taxes from tens of millions of workers and the writing of tens of millions of pension checks is the kind of routine, semi-automatic task that government can do well.
With private companies backing away from defined-benefit programs, it is even more important and valuable that government do it in our post-industrial network-age society than it was in the past.
The Islamic Democratic Paradox
The rage across the Arab world over the publication in Denmark (months ago) of cartoons depicting the prophet Mohammed, together with the victory of Hamas in Palestine and the increasing radicalization of Iran's politics, has made "political Islam" a fundamental question of international diplomacy.
But a one-size-fits-all response won't work.
Indeed, we need to abandon the idea that there is a holistic or global Islamist movement.
Political Islam of all colors has emerged as the main alternative to secular Arab nationalist regimes whose legitimacy, based on the struggle for national liberation, has evaporated due to their inability to resolve economic and social problems, establish the rule of law, and guarantee fundamental freedoms.
In Palestine, for example, the Islamists triumphed over Fatah because of years of bad governance under the harsh conditions spawned by Israeli occupation.
Successive European and American governments share an atavistic fear of the "Islamic alternative" to Arab secular nationalists like Fatah, and so have defended the status quo.
But repression of all Arab opposition movements by the region's monarchs and secular dictators meant that "protection of the Mosque" became the only umbrella under which to engage politically.
Now political Islam can no longer be contained, because democracy cannot be built by driving underground parties that have a strong social base, as was tragically demonstrated in Algeria 15 years ago.
The only alternative to authoritarianism is to craft a transition that allows Islamists to participate in public life and encourages them to accept unequivocally the rules of the democratic game.
There are already many examples of more or less conservative Islamist parties that are willing to play along.
It is no accident that there are Islamists in the legislatures of all the countries undergoing some form of political reform, including Lebanon, where Hezbollah is part of a freely elected government, as well as Jordan and Morocco.
In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood has become a strong force in parliament despite the limits imposed on the participation of Islamist groups in last year's elections.
In Iraq, free elections have revealed the enormous influence of Islamist currents.
In Turkey, the transition to democracy led the Islamist Justice and Development Party to power.
That government has undertaken various important democratic reforms and initiated accession negotiations with the EU.
These Islamist parties have nothing to do with Al Qaeda, even though some of the most conservative among them have adopted somewhat similar ideological positions.
The risk of political transitions that may lead to the victory of Islamist parties is a democratic paradox that Europe and the US must accept if they are to devise inclusive reform policies -- in other words, policies that are the polar opposite of the type of democratic imposition practiced in occupied Iraq.
Indeed, one of the less fortunate consequences of the intervention in Iraq was to reinforce the notion of a "clash of civilizations" between the West from Islam, which in turn serves to create a climate favorable to Islamist movements.
After all, political reform movements in the Muslim world emerged long before the US-led "war on terror," and reformists were not waiting for the EU to become stronger to press for change.
These movements were not created in the US or Europe after September 11, 2001, and they will not wait for or depend on the US or the EU to act.
Nevertheless, the success of Muslim moderates may well depend on how the EU and the US respond to pressure for reform and how they decide to encourage change.
It is now necessary to show that democracy is the best path for Palestinians to attain their national goals.
This depends largely on the new Hamas government and its transformation into a democratic force that respects the rule of law, democracy, and international legality.
But it also depends on Israel and the international community, which must do all they can to ensure a future Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
Supporting Palestinian democratization does not mean that the international community should not demand that Hamas abandon terror for once and for all, demilitarize, respect the Palestinian constitution, and accept the existence of the state of Israel.
But it also does not mean supporting sanctions that would hurt the Palestinian people after they have expressed their will democratically.
This would be a terrible mistake in any effort to consolidate Palestine's new democracy, with a negative impact in other reforming countries in the Arab world.
Similarly, accepting the right of non-violent Islamists to participate in public life does not mean giving up on the political and ideological struggle to defeat ultra-conservative, and in some cases totalitarian, conceptions of society.
Combating racism, promoting tolerance, and respecting the religious sentiments of others does not mean that we need to question press freedom or accept Islamists' demands for censorship, even when real religious sentiments are offended, as in the case of the Danish caricatures.
Islamist conceptions of society that violate individual rights must be rebutted politically.
That political challenge is one of the paradoxes of democracy, which allows all ideas to compete freely with each other.
Political Islam is a risk, but we can minimize it only by devising intelligent, case-sensitive strategies that promote democracy, not by denouncing the results of democratic choice.
The War on "Democratization"
The wars in Lebanon and Gaza constitute a grave threat to democratic reform in the southern Mediterranean.
These wars are inflicting heavy punishment on precisely those peoples who have held fully free and fair elections in the region, while eroding the legitimacy of Israel's democracy.
At the time of its "Cedar Revolution" last year, Lebanon was held up as the best example so far of democratization in the Arab world.
The enthusiasm with which the international community welcomed those changes now seems all but forgotten, which is also true of recent elections in Palestine -- another longstanding international demand.
The signal being sent is clear: it is preferable that Israel, the only state in the region that abides by the rule of law, be surrounded by authoritarian regimes where political outcomes are predictable than by democratic states where Islamists may well rise to power.
It happened in Palestine, and it could well happen in Egypt if free and fair free elections were held.
As a result, Arab nationalist governments feel justified in resisting serious political reform and vindicated in repressing all domestic opposition, particularly the swelling Islamist movements.
But it should now be clear to everyone that democratization in the southern Mediterranean cannot bypass Islamist movements, and that the success of that process largely depends on the degree to which their full participation in the political arena is ensured.
Of course, this requires their renouncing violence as a means of achieving power.
Repressing political Islam, or attempting to "erase" Islamists militarily with total disregard for national political processes (not to mention human life), is not the answer, because it won't persuade electorates to turn away from Islamist movements.
The efforts of reformist governments in the region to integrate such movements into the public sphere have been dealt a severe blow.
Democracies have long known that extreme and indiscriminate punishment -- which by definition affects friend and foe, combatant and civilian alike -- is a grave violation of international law, as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Louise Arbour, has pointed out.
They also know that such action fuels radicalism, leading to the kind of tragic consequences that are all too familiar nowadays.
Hezbollah is, after all, a creature of Lebanon's resistance to Israel's 1982 invasion, now trying to reassert its influence at home and in the wider region by portraying itself as a champion of the Arab-Islamic cause, namely in Palestine.
Any reinforcement of its power will necessarily weaken Lebanon and the region's democratic forces.
The prolonged absence of the United States from truly active engagement in the Middle East peace process is partly to blame for the current situation.
For almost six years, there has been no significant US diplomatic initiative to resolve the Palestinian question or to pursue the Syrian track (Israel still occupies the Golan Heights).
Moreover, just when we were beginning to think that the Iraqi tragedy had made the limits of unilateralism and preemptive military strategies clear to all, the Bush administration encourages Israel's military action -- this time against a country that has painfully been attempting to consolidate democratic reform and to reafirm its sovereignty in relation to Syria .
Bush's most promising initiative, promoting democracy across the Middle East, was already dealt a crippling blow by US intervention in Iraq and the ensuing civil war there.
Now the project is buried under the weight of America's inability to protect Lebanon's fragile democracy and Palestine's democratic experiment.
The European Union's feeble response to the warfare in Gaza and Lebanon has oscillated between understanding and condemnation of the disproportionate use of force by Israel (described as "ten eyes for one" by the Finnish presidency), thereby betraying its dependence on the US to end the violence.
Europeans will have learned nothing from the damaging disunity, and thus weakness, that they displayed during the Iraq war if this conflict does not compel them to speak with one voice.
What is needed is a European initiative that is backed by a credible military deterrent, consisting of forces from the EU, Turkey, and Arab countries, to be dispatched under a UN mandate to Lebanon and Gaza.
Europe must not only put forward a clear demand for an immediate cease-fire and the end to Syrian and Iranian meddling in Lebanon, it must also provide the means to enforce it as well as massive support for Lebanon's reconstruction.
The EU should decisively back the end of the embargo on Palestine and the urgent creation of a Palestinian state.
A common European front could persuade the US to give Lebanon and Palestine enough time to consolidate their national democratic processes, thus isolating the radical elements of Hamas and steering Hezbollah to dissolution of its private army.
With the US project in ruins, a credible European policy to delegitimize war and support democratization in its neighborhood has become essential.
The Environment of the Economy
No economy is a closed, autonomous universe, governed by rules independent from law, morals, and politics.
Indeed, the most interesting economic questions are generally located on the borderline with neighboring disciplines.
But nowhere is this clearer than in the interaction between economic processes and the natural environment.
The distinctive feature of this exchange is that it is governed not by the laws of mechanics, but by thermodynamics, particularly the law of entropy, according to which the quantity of free energy that can be transformed into mechanical work diminishes with time -- an irreversible process culminating in "heat death."
Numerous researchers, inspired by the late Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen's pioneering work on the relationship between economic processes and physics, tried -- not very successfully -- to formulate an "entropic" theory of economy and society, especially during the 1970's.
The entropic view assumes that economic processes produce irreversible consequences because of their multiple interactions with nature.
We draw from stocks of non-renewable natural resources (for example, oil and metal ores), and we deteriorate or modify the quality of other resources (for example, water and arable land) by imposing on them a rhythm of exploitation superior to their capacity for regeneration.
In fact, the exploitation of non-renewable resources frees the speed of economic growth from that of ecological renewal, aggravating the deterioration of the biosphere, including irreversible climate changes.
The law of entropy reminds us that we will leave to future generations a degraded natural patrimony, probably less adequate to their needs than what we inherited.
Unfortunately, there are no simple answers.
For the sake of what principle can we ask China and India, for example, to limit their economic dynamism so that they use smaller amounts of the planet's natural resources?
After all, the advanced countries' slower growth is not the consequence of voluntary self-limitation, but of our superior standard of living -- and of our incapacity to settle our own economic imbalances.
We cannot impose an ecological rhythm on people who are poorer than we are when it is the very fact that we freed ourselves from that rhythm that made us richer.
Economic contraction, or even stagnation, is not a solution for the developed countries, either, for a similar reason: it would imply that we either accept existing inequalities or impose a regime aiming at an equal redistribution of resources.
That choice boils down to an unbearable cynicism or a totalitarian utopia.
But, happily for us, our evolution is determined not only by entropy, but also by the accumulation of knowledge and technological progress -- a process that is just as irreversible as the decrease in stocks of non-renewable resources and the degradation of environmental quality.
Thus, the economy is entropic for resources and historical for the production, organization, and spread of knowledge, with the prospects for economic and environmental sustainability residing in the space left between those two dynamic processes: the level of growth we choose must be conditioned on a sufficient level of knowledge to ensure the system's survival.
Yet nature, like knowledge, is a public good that needs state intervention to be "produced" in sufficient quantities.
The only way to overcome the finiteness of our world is to maintain as much space as possible between entropy and history by investing in education and research aimed at increasing renewable energies, reducing the energy intensity of our standards of living, and slowing the pace of environmental erosion.
It is widely believed that such a strategy would be useless if the only effect is to allow others to get rich faster by opting out.
But if that strategy is conceived as mastering two dynamic processes, overcoming the ecological constraint could be an accelerator of growth.
The Stem-Cell Race Continues
Scientific research is usually conducted to improve our lives, but it is also an industry, one that represents a massive investment by governments and corporations alike.
The stakes and potential rewards for a few research topics are exceptionally high, which is why the recent finding that the Korean scientist Hwang Woo-suk fabricated the results of his work on stem cells has reverberated so widely.
The episode highlights the ongoing race in global health research that is playing out in the field of stem cells.
Possibly one of the biggest prizes in medical history is up for grabs, and anyone -- truly anyone -- could seize it.
The last big scientific race of this type was the effort to map the human genome, which promises to alter future lives radically.
That study was initiated by the United States, which used insights developed in the wake of the atomic bombing of Japan to understand the extent of long-term genetic damage.
The current research effort on stem cells and their potential is just as grand, because it will lead to an equally radical medical revolution.
A stem cell is special because it is able to reproduce a form that is different from itself.
Whereas a skin cell or a liver cell, for instance, can reproduce only more skin or liver, stem cells, which are the most robust at the beginning of human development, are "master" cells.
As a fertilized egg turns into an embryo, and then a fetus, those initial stem cells somehow show their daughter cells how to become skin, liver, eye, or bone.
We need to know how this transformation is activated.
Such knowledge would lead to huge, patentable advances.
Most attention is focused on genetic diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and to muscular dystrophy.
In these cases, stem cells would be encouraged to restore nerve tissue.
This would also benefit patients with brain and spinal injuries, or those who have suffered strokes and paralysis.
There would be gains in parallel fields, too, such as gene therapy.
A stem cell changes its identity through a process of "triggering" -- a signal literally "turns on" the liver cell gene inside the stem version.
When scientists figure out how to flip these switches, it might be possible to introduce stem cells into the body and activate them so that they correctly replace damaged tissue, whatever it is.
Not surprisingly, given its huge potential, teams of scientists have been mobilized almost everywhere for embryonic stem cell research.
The race has become all the more dramatic since the leading researcher, the US, dropped out, owing to the influence of religion on politics (although the state of California has decided not to miss out, and recently approved a $3 billion subsidy for embryonic stem cell research).
Because the promise is so great, and the science does not require massive infrastructure, many smaller countries have rushed to take advantage of the absence of the US.
Any competent medical research center can enter the race, whether in Mexico, Ethiopia, Indonesia or Yemen.
Whoever wins will have added the equivalent of a Saudi oil field to their economy.
But, although anyone can win, science at this level is never a "eureka" event, with some single breakthrough suddenly ending the race.
Discoveries occur incrementally, and, because it is science, each step is announced and tested.
Research establishments gain momentum this way, with the leaders sweeping up talent, resources, and prestige in a rough-and-tumble intellectual ecology.
Embedded in the larger race are many smaller ones, which jostle for early, impressive results.
In May 2005, Hwang's research center in Seoul reported the first major achievement.
They claimed that they had developed a technique whereby new, perfect stem cells could be cloned from ordinary ones.
This was big news, for it implied that sufficient numbers of stem cells could be made without controversy, thus allowing anyone to be able to do quality research while avoiding what US President George W. Bush described as "taking a life to save a life."
More importantly, the Koreans did a common thing these days: they claimed patent rights over the process.
It almost looked for a moment as though South Korea would become a world superpower in health matters.
We now know that the Seoul researchers made up the whole thing.
An investigation by a Seoul National University investigative panel has concluded that the "cloned" stem cells were really created by test-tube fertilizations.
The fraud has bewildered the science community, particularly because the claim that the Korean researchers made was so transparently false.
Why, then, did they place their reputations and careers in jeopardy?
Medical research has always faced many challenges, even when the scientific quest was simply one of discovery.
Now, the challenges are complicated by politics, market forces, and national interests.
With stem cell research, huge fortunes depend on which group takes the lead, wherever their laboratory is located.
As the competition heats up, we should expect amazing developments -- and no doubt more public relations gimmicks.
Islam versus Asia's Chinese Diaspora
When Malaysia's prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamed, recently announced that he intended to resign, Malaysians of Chinese descent joined Mahathir's Malay party loyalists in demanding that he reconsider.
When Mahathir agreed to stay on, if only for another 16 months, the sighs of relief from these Chinese Malaysians were the loudest of all.
That ethnic Chinese Malaysians rallied to Dr. Mahathir's side marks a quiet revolution in Malaysian politics, one that demonstrates how much Mahathir's nationalist image has softened during his 22 years in power.
It also shows how much Malaysia's ethnic Chinese have changed in their views about the nationalist movement that once seemed so antagonistic to them.
When Southeast Asia's colonial rulers were overthrown four decades ago, ethnic Chinese often shunned the nationalist movements that fought for independence.
Some movements saw the local Chinese as outsiders or as intrinsically disloyal for seeming to have benefited disproportionately during the years of imperial rule.
Across the region, anti-Chinese communal violence was widespread.
In the decades since, many Chinese remained suspicious of political parties with ties to the former national liberation movements.
In Malaysia, that fear is dissipating.
Malaysia's Chinese citizens now view Premier Mahathir as a bastion against a new form of violent extremism: the threat posed by Muslim fundamentalism.
Such a bulwark is something members of the vast Chinese diaspora across Southeast Asia need, not only in Malaysia, where Islamic extremism remains a small threat, but in Indonesia, where thousands of Chinese have been killed and injured in rioting in recent years, and where thousands more have seen their property damaged or lost.
Among most of Southeast Asia's ethnic Chinese, the presence of even a hint of allegiance to a secular distinction between faith and state in a Muslim leader is admired like a precious gem.
When found among Islamic believers like Mahathir, evidence of secular tolerance represents a rare sign of modernity and commitment to progress.
Dr. Mahathir has always been a hard-headed modernist.
Lately, he has begun to admit that the "Malay first" policies he has promoted since 1969 have failed to produce the skilled Malay elite essential to a modern knowledge economy.
Mahathir calls for young Malays to work harder, despite knowing that this is an unpopular thing to say.
Much of this new tone in Malaysia's ethnic politics has gone unnoticed due to the furor surrounding Mahathir's efforts to discredit his former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.
This campaign to denigrate Mr. Anwar cost Mahathir's party, the United Malay National Organization (UMNO), much support among ethnic Malays.
Indeed, during the 1999 national elections, Mahathir retained power only with the help of Chinese voters.
Now non-Malays hope that he will reconsider the idea of special treatment for ethnic Malays.
Such reform, however, remains anathema among Malays.
Malaysia's ethnic Chinese are also impressed by Dr. Mahathir's skillful response to American demands to combat terrorism.
The Premier used this opportunity to soften his anti-Western image by re-affirming his modernist and secular position against those who sympathized with Islamic extremism.
By doing so he revitalized the multi-cultural base of the National Alliance that has ruled Malaysia since independence in 1957.
All of this helped rally Malaysia's Chinese community to his side.
Contrast this with the Chinese in Indonesia, a country where everything secular and modern is associated with political and cultural conformity to the nation-state.
For thirty years, former President Suharto systematically discriminated against ethnic Chinese, while at the same time favoring a few select Chinese cronies, who helped his family and military colleagues make huge, ill-gotten profits.
For the indigenous majority who remained poor, such cronyism spawned an image of the Chinese as corrupt and unscrupulously greedy.
Despite memories of the slaughter of Chinese during the anti-communist purges of the 1960s, Indonesia's Chinese were unprepared for the intense hatred shown in the riots of May 1998, when arson and looting, as well as gang rapes of numerous Chinese women, battered the Chinese community.
Such violence still casts a shadow over ethnic relations in Indonesia.
Successive Indonesian governments headed by Presidents Habibie, Abdulrahman Wahid and Megawati Sukarnoputri all welcomed the Chinese to play their customary leading role in business.
Yet Indonesian officials waver from assuring the Chinese that they retain equal rights as citizens, and they have allowed various forms of discrimination to run rampant.
Today's tensions between Indonesia's secularists, religious believers, and various Muslim extremist groups has taken the spotlight off the Chinese, allowing many to resume their economic role under conditions of growing uncertainty.
But the personal security they crave, and which Malaysia's ethnic Chinese are achieving, is as far away as ever.
Indeed, Indonesia is unlikely any time soon to produce a leader they can depend upon in ways that Malaysia's Chinese now rely upon Premier Mahathir.
Football and Philosophy
Gooooal!!!
Heavenly bliss, or hellish pain, depending on which team has scored: ours, or theirs.
How can the trajectory of a ball cause so much pain or bliss?
For weeks I have sat at my television watching the World Cup.
My wife threatens me with divorce and other disciplinary measures.
What is the source of this attraction, this magic?
The world of play is our permanent Garden of Eden.
At any moment we may step from our real world into the freedom, innocence, and bliss of play.
Football and the Garden of Eden?
What do they have to do with each other?
Each delineates a sacred sphere of freedom and order, innocence, spirituality and justice from our everyday world of chaos, bondage, injustice and guilt.
The chessboard, the tennis court, the soccer field: within their boundaries we feel free because here it is we who make the rules and are not subjected to the iron laws of the outside world.
We feel innocent too, because the world of play is also a world of innocence: a Garden of Eden before the Fall.
Here we can be childishly selfish, we can gratify our thirst for success, power and domination - all without guilt.
In the world of play freedom is generated, paradoxically, by restrictions.
In soccer, the basic rule is simple: the ball is to be moved, from the central point, into one of the goals.
If the ball would roll from the center point straight into one of the goals, its track would be, or would seem to be, strictly determined and the whole thing would be boring.
To generate freedom, rules put obstacles in the way of the ball and complicate its movement.
First, two teams of eleven players are put on the field with the task of getting the ball into the goal.
Second, they are told to get the ball into opposite goals.
With twenty-two players with their own wills and skills, with various movements of confrontation and cooperation, the number of possible combinations is increased almost ad infinitum.
After this only one additional factor is needed to create a real world of happy surprises, freedom and bliss: the ball.
Balls are among the most important "freedom generators" in our lives.
A ball is freedom embodied.
It may bounce in any direction.
It seems to have its "own will."
It is an object and, nevertheless, it seems to be free.
By introducing the factor of chance and unpredictability into the game, the ball transforms a bitter and down-to-earth human fight into an epiphany of spirituality and freedom.
In its brisk movements chance and human will interact, dance, and somersault with each other.
The ball flashes to and fro in happy irresponsibility - between human will and chance, freedom and limitation, success and failure, hope and the loss of hope - to bounce back into the world of hope in the next moment.
It has its own universe.
It moves in the sphere of the sacred.
But that sacred does not exist without the profane.
The football field is marked off and opposed to the surrounding world.
The experience and the sacred ceremony remain incomplete if tension between the field and the grandstand is missing.
The clean emerald field and freedom of the game must be opposed by the howling mob in the darkness of the stands, burning red torches and jerking between ecstatic joy and hellish misery.
In our everyday lives, reason and passions are mixed.
Soccer (like some other games) separates, and opposes to each other, these two realms.
All passions, emotions and instincts are pushed over to the side of the spectators.
They rage and love, prance and explode, and finally reach a catharsis (if their team wins) or to descend into hell (if their team loses ).
At the same time, they watch, perceive, and experience the freedom of Apollonian or Platonic spirituality of the game going on in the field.
Yes, players move in a world of spirituality.
They act according to clear, sacred rules.
While in play, they are supposed to act as pure rational beings who leave behind their everyday passions and emotions, personal wishes or fears.
They move in the world of pure morality and justice.
The player's world is one of justice and total impartiality; of a perfect equality of opportunity, which is never achieved in our everyday lives.
Even advantages deriving from the direction of the wind are balanced.
The two teams change sides at the half.
When and where do we, the privileged and the underprivileged, change sides in the real world?
Players, too, are not supposed to break the rules.
If they do, they are punished and, if they relapse, excluded from play.
They are expelled from the sphere of spirituality and we see them disappearing into the chilly Hades of the locker room.
The real expulsion from Paradise comes only if the sanctity of play is profaned, if the spell is broken: by players falling out of their angelic roles and starting a fight in the field; by a cheating referee; by people realizing that a match is rigged; by spectators invading the field.
Such events do lasting damage to people and to the community.
It is a bitter shock to realize the fragility of our world of freedom, spirituality, and dignity and awaken again (as we will when the Cup winner is decided) in our less hospitable everyday world.
Egypt Needs a President, Not a Pharaoh
Egypt is undergoing a heated nationwide debate over political reform.
The central issue is a demand by all opposition parties and civil society groups to amend the 1971 constitution and abolish the 23-year-old State of Emergency that was imposed following Anwar Sadat's assassination in 1981.
Such demands are not new.
But President Hosni Mubarak and the ruling National Democratic Party have been stonewalling since the mid-1980's.
What makes the demands for reform more pressing this time are ominous developments in Egypt, the region, and in the wider world.
At home, concern about Mubarak's age (76) and deteriorating health has grown.
Mubarak's ill health, widely rumored for years, was never officially acknowledged until November 2003, when it could no longer be covered up.
While speaking to Parliament, Mubarak fainted before millions of TV viewers.
Although he returned an hour later and delivered the rest of his speech, Egyptians began to demand greater transparency regarding the president's health as well as other state affairs.
Meanwhile, Egypt's sagging economy, high unemployment rate, and rampant corruption have driven many Egyptian youngsters to despair.
More than one half of living Egyptians were born since Mubarak assumed office.
According to a recent report by the UN Development Program, roughly half of those between 15 and 30 years old dream of emigrating to Europe, North America, or Australia.
There are weekly reports of would-be illegal Egyptian immigrants drowning in the Mediterranean.
A few weeks ago, several youngsters suffocated to death while being deported back to Egypt across the Libyan desert in overloaded trucks.
The incident caused an uproar that compelled the authorities to arrest, interrogate, and try the Egyptian police officers in charge.
Regional and international events have also emboldened the Egyptian opposition, not only to press for reform, but to focus on amending the constitution's articles that pertain to the presidency.
Mubarak has been re-elected four times, and rumors have persisted that he will either seek a fifth six-year term or establish a "hereditary republic" and groom his 41-year old son, Gamal, to succeed him, like Syria's Hafez al-Assad and son, Bashar.
The opposition battle cry is "No" to Mubarak's re-election and "No" to passing the presidency to Gamal.
Many Egyptians may not have major misgivings about Gamal Mubarak per se, but they find it mortifying that, after 24 years of the father, they might be stuck with another 24 or more years of the son.
The current constitution was adopted in October 1971, and has 211 articles, 30 of which concern the presidency.
The president is nominated by two-thirds of the People's Assembly, and endorsed in a plebiscite that allows only for a simple "Yes" or "No."
A simple majority of the ballots is required to win a six-year term, which is renewable indefinitely by the same process.
These lax procedures contrast jarringly with the president's powers.
The president is the head of state and commander-in-chief; officiates over the Supreme Judiciary Council, the Supreme Police Council, and the Cabinet of Ministers; and can appoint and recall one or more vice-presidents at his sole discretion.
He also appoints the prime minister and senior ministers, and must approve all other ministers, ambassadors, and state representatives.
He can call general elections, declare war, impose a state of emergency, and issue decrees that have the force of law.
There are no checks and balances on these powers.
A single article stipulates that, "Accusation of the President of committing grand treason or any other criminal act may be made upon a motion submitted by at least one-third of members of the People's Assembly and approved by two-thirds."
The president is then suspended from carrying out his duties, and the vice-president fills in until the accusation is resolved.
But Mubarak has never enacted the law essential to implementing this article or appointed a vice-president, despite repeated popular demands to do so.
The result has been a de facto "imperial presidency," with Mubarak likened to the god-king Pharaohs of ancient Egypt.
No other head of state in modern times enjoys as much power.
A more apt analogy popular in Egypt compares Mubarak to Leonid Brezhnev, who for two decades presided over the Soviet Union's stagnation and decline.
Egypt's status as a regional power under Mubarak has similarly weakened steadily.
On the economic front, annual foreign investment inflows have plummeted from $3 billion in the mid-1990's to a minuscule $300 million in 2003.
Demands for reform are now focused on introducing direct presidential elections with two or more contenders, and limiting presidents to two consecutive terms in office.
It is no less important to reduce the presidency's sweeping powers and formulate viable mechanisms for enforcing the accountability of all public officials without exception.
Should Mubarak and his government fail to recommend constitutional amendments that satisfy these demands, ever more Egyptians will desert the regime and risk their lives in search of salvation in other lands.
Bush's Second Gulf Disaster
President Bush has asked that Americans not "play politics" at this moment of terrible national disaster.
But asking hard questions of our nation's leaders is exactly what democracy demands when the government's response to Hurricane Katrina is widely viewed as "a national disgrace."
Katrina came with at least two days' warning, but authorities waited to issue an evacuation order.
There was no transportation for people without cars or money, facilities to house and care for refugees were insufficient, there were no forces in place to deliver desperately needed supplies or to secure order, and there was nowhere near the number of boats, helicopters, and other craft necessary to rescue the stranded.
Hampered by a National Guard with 40% of its people in Iraq, the pace of getting military personnel to the hardest hit areas was inordinately slow.
For four days, there was simply no clear center of command and control.
As a result, countless people suffered and died.
Much of this failure is the result of the Bush administration's policies, which effectively eroded the capacities of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the government agency primarily responsible for dealing with disasters.
Obsessed with the war on terror as well as an ideology of privatizing the functions of government, the administration systematically sapped FEMA's long-term ability to prevent disaster or at least cushion the blows when prevention is not possible.
FEMA was downsized and downgraded from a cabinet position, then placed under the Department of Homeland Security.
Its mission of disaster planning and preparation was dropped entirely, and its focus was altered to fight terrorists.
Its leadership had no experience in disaster management.
The past director was one of Bush's Texas political cronies, and the current director's qualifications include a stint as commissioner for judges and stewards with the International Arabian Horse Association, where he was asked to resign for "supervision failures."
Since 2001, billions of dollars were shifted from disaster relief to homeland security and the war in Iraq.
Key disaster mitigation programs were slashed and federal funding for post-disaster relief was cut in half.
The Army Corps of Engineers' budget for levee construction in New Orleans was gutted, including funds specifically aimed at the Southeast Louisiana Urban Flood Control Project.
Preventive measures to protect people and property were not carried out despite FEMA's own conclusion in 2001 that a major hurricane hitting New Orleans was one of the three "likeliest, most catastrophic disasters facing this country."
Believing FEMA to be an "oversized entitlement program" and that the "business of government is not to provide services," Bush's first FEMA director instituted new outsourcing requirements as part of a major privatization effort.
This provoked a brain drain as experienced FEMA personnel moved into the private sector
Privatization also left poorer states and poorer communities especially vulnerable.
As money dried up and federal programs were contracted out to private firms at higher rates, only the richest and politically most important states and communities could compete successfully for the scarce federal grants necessary to pay for services.
For example, Florida (with 16 more electoral votes than Louisiana and where the president's brother governs) received its requested funding to protect its wetlands.
By contrast, a more needy Louisiana (with its staggering 24% poverty rate) was denied its request for flood-mitigation funds in 2004.
With Louisiana's ability to protect itself weakened and the center of disaster relief badly undermined, an inadequate government response and unnecessary destruction were almost inevitable -- with the poor paying the price.
But the failure of this administration runs deeper than its chronic and intentional diversion of resources away from the types of policies that keep people safe from disaster.
Despite scientific evidence demonstrating that the increased intensity and frequency of hurricanes is related to climate change, the Bush administration systematically rejects participation in international climate-protection regimes.
Rather than continue a ban on wetlands development instituted by previous administrations, the Bush administration overturned it.
Because development-provoked erosion has brought the Gulf of Mexico 20 miles closer to land than it was in 1965, hurricanes are able to retain more strength, and their winds and waves pack more speed and destructive power.
Similarly, loss of wetlands threatened New Orleans' levees, which were built on the assumption that they would have 40 to 50 miles of protective swamp as buffer between the city and the Gulf of Mexico.
Despite every major study showing that a massive coastal restoration program and higher levees were needed to protect New Orleans, the administration permitted federal agencies to stop protecting 20 million acres of wetlands, allowed developers to drain thousands of acres and in 2004 cut funding for holding back the waters of Lake Pontchartrain by more than 80%.
New Orleans is America's canary in the mineshaft.
Ideologies of privatization that incapacitate effective government, permitting the privileged to save themselves while leaving the poor clinging to roofs, must now be challenged.
This disaster is a chilling reminder of what happens when government fails to protect its citizens, and it is imperative that Americans demand accountability.
Officials who did not do their jobs must be dismissed, and elected officials whose policies aggravated the devastation wrought by Katrina must be removed from office.
We owe this to the dead and to the survivors.
The Autumn of the Commandante
The death watch for Fidel Castro is something that only Gabriel Garcia Marquez could get right.
His novel Autumn of the Patriarch captures perfectly the moral squalor, political paralysis, and savage ennui that enshrouds a society awaiting the death of a long-term dictator.
Commandante Fidel's departure from power, of course, will be solely a matter of biology, and the few pictures of him that have emerged since he took ill last year clearly show biology at work.
When the end comes, change in Cuba could be as vast as any that greeted the end of the last century's great dictators.
Stalin, Franco, Tito, Mao: all were mostly alike in their means and methods.
How they passed from the scene, however, was often very different, and these differences can shape societies for years and decades to come.
Consider the Soviet Union.
On March 9, 1953, from the Gulf of Finland to the Bering Sea, everything stood still; likewise in Warsaw, Budapest, Prague, and East Berlin.
In Beijing, Mao Zedong himself bowed low before an immense effigy of Joseph Stalin.
Huge mourning crowds, crying, nearly hysterical, could be seen all over the vast empire Stalin had ruled.
Yet, within days, the word Stalinism was being expunged from a new Soviet dictionary, and three years later my grandfather, Nikita Khrushchev, denounced Stalin's "cult of personality" in his famous "Secret Speech" to the Communist Party's XXth Congress.
The Khrushchev thaw that followed may have been short-lived, but for the first time in Soviet history the possibility of change was opened -- a possibility that Mikhail Gorbachev seized upon in 1985.
The death of Marshal Josip Broz Tito brought forth an outpouring of another sort.
For decades, his personal rule imposed a false unity on Yugoslavia.
Following his death in 1980, that artificial state began to unravel, culminating in the genocidal wars in Bosnia, Croatia, and Kosovo of the 1990's.
Not all long-term dictatorships, however, end in disintegration and mayhem.
Mao's death allowed for Deng Xiaoping's return from disgrace and internal exile.
Deng quickly routed Mao's "Gang of Four" heirs, and in only a few years opened China's economy, fueling a capitalist revolution that has transformed China far more completely -- and successfully -- than Mao's socialist revolution ever did.
The Communist Party, of course, remains in power, and Mao's portrait still looms over Tiananmen Square.
But both are mere relics of ideas and ideals that in reality have been consigned to the dustbin of history.
Spain, too, escaped violent dissolution when Generalissimo Francisco Franco's fascist dictatorship collapsed at his death.
Here the old dictator can take some credit, for by re-establishing the monarchy under King Juan Carlos just before he died, Franco provided Spain with a foundation on which to build anew.
Little did Franco realize that what Juan Carlos would build, with the help of a clever young Franco-era bureaucrat named Adolfo Suarez, was the modern, democratic Spain of today.
It was no accident that communist countries were (and are) usually run by geriatric leaders, and democracies by younger men and women.
That difference matters.
Old leaders can preside successfully over smoothly running countries that need no radical re-examination of their policies and purposes.
There are exceptions to this rule, of course -- Churchill, Adenauer, Deng, Reagan -- but states cannot count on fortune bringing an exceptional ruler their way.
Younger leaders are more likely to be able to cope with the chop and change of difficult times.
Political competition makes it necessary for all politicians, whatever their age, to stay on their toes, anticipate new problems, and remain open to new ideas aimed at addressing them.
No one can keep himself ensconced in high office subject only to death or his own boredom.
One-party systems, one-man charismatic dictatorships, or a mixture of the two, as in Tito's Yugoslavia, are a guarantee of sclerotic minds and inert governments.
So what will become of Cuba after Fidel departs?
Many observers portray Raúl Castro, Fidel's younger brother and designated heir, as a pragmatist -- the "practical Castro."
When Cuba's lavish Soviet subsidies vanished in the early 1990's, it was Raúl who recognized that the regime's survival required economic reforms, pressing to allow private agricultural markets to reopen in order to boost food production and stave off possible starvation.
However, this is the same man who, as the head of Cuba's internal security apparatus, for many years represented the knuckles of an iron-fisted regime, directly responsible for imprisoning -- and often torturing -- thousands of dissidents.
So perhaps the best that could be hoped for is a Russian-style experiment with liberalization that is quickly called off by the regime's nervous Old Guard.
Moreover, with the support of oil-rich allies like Venezuela's President Hugo Chávez -- and with the recent discovery of significant crude reserves off Cuba's own coast -- introducing reforms could well become less urgent.
In that case, Raúl may seek to cling grimly to the fossilized system that he helped build and maintain with such brutality.
But Raúl Castro is an old man himself, so we can hope for the prospect that some Deng or, better yet, a Suarez will ultimately emerge from the wreckage of Fidelism.
But for now, younger communist officials, like Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque, remain ideological hardliners whom many Cubans refer to as "los Taliban."
If they take control and stick to their guns, Cuba could face another long biology lesson.
Ecb Is Now Europe's Anchor
The European Central Bank is making its reputation at this time of turmoil and crisis.
Barely a month after the rejection of the European Union Constitution in France and the Netherlands, the EU Summit in Brussels ended in a surprisingly acrimonious orgy of national egoisms and no deal. Then the terrorists struck in London.
With all this trouble, the ECB is showing itself to be an "anchor of stability" by steadfastly sticking to its mandate of insuring price stability. 
Europe suffers from a profound crisis of confidence.
Its economy, for example, cannot recover properly because consumers, lacking confidence in the ability of their political leaders to solve the economy's manifold economic problems (budget deficits, pensions, etc.), are saving for a rainy day they feel is just around the corner—and businessmen are reluctant to invest, because they don't trust government to make the necessary economic reforms.
The public's lack of confidence in the EU's political leadership is totally justified.
Instead of actually doing something constructive about Europe's essential problem --reforming expensive welfare states to ensure global competitiveness--Europe's political leaders are hiding behind straw man arguments about "ultra liberal Anglo Saxon models," and pressuring the ECB to lower interest rates as if European economic weakness were Frankfurt's fault.
Europe's finance ministers portray the ECB as closed to dialogue.
When testifying before the EU Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, Luxembourg prime minister and Euro-group chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said there should be "open and frank" talks between the euro-group ministers and the ECB—and French finance minister Dominique de Villepin said the same thing.
According to a knowledgeable ECB source, however, Europe's finance ministers regularly meet in secret with the ECB leadership for a mutual and frank exchange of views on monetary policy and other issues.
The dialogue already exists though the public does not know it. Such disingenuousness does little to boost confidence in Europe's political leadership.  
The ECB has done all it can for growth by giving Europe a prolonged period of monetary stability at record low interest rates.
Does anyone really believe consumers are holding back on spending —and businessmen postponing their investments—in anticipation of that next drop in interest rates?
To paraphrase Keynes, you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink.
"The last thing Europe needs now is an interest rate cut," says one influential member of the ECB Governing Council in a candid assessment of the current situation.  Capitulating to outside political pressure is no one's definition of an "anchor of stability."
The euro would collapse, and the ECB finished as a creditable central bank.
Moreover, ECB chief economist Otmar Issing predicts long- term interest rates would go up—not down—as inflationary expectations increased.
So cutting interest rates would not only be stupid—it would be crazy.
But the ECB is not going to cut rates even though, for public relations reasons of keeping the political wolves at bay, it deceptively hints it might.
Don't be fooled by such feints. The ECB is holding fast and, in doing so, demonstrates to Europe's peoples that there is at least one EU institution they can trust.
This is vital.
History shows political turmoil often leads to inflation, which only fuels further turmoil.
Europeans can bet their last euro the ECB will not let the fledgling common currency be ravaged by inflation because their political leaders, having failed to do their jobs, now fear they might lose them.
Indeed, the courage currently demonstrated by the ECB in sticking to its guns should serve as a model for Europe's future politicians.
Once they realize they can't bully the ECB into unwanted and self-destructive interest rate cuts, EU leaders actually might summon up the will to lead—which is, after all, what they have been elected to do.
The Arafat Succession Scramble
To understand what the Palestinian cause will look like without Yasir Arafat, consider the various titles that he currently holds.
Arafat is Chairman of the PLO executive Committee, President of the Palestinian National Authority, Commander-in-chief of the Palestinian forces, and head of the Fatah movement.
The PLO embodies Palestinian national aspirations for independence and statehood.
It is the highest political body for all Palestinians, both those living in Palestine and the refugees and other Palestinians in the diaspora.
Arafat's successor will need to juggle between negotiations with Israel, which will require concession on refugees' "right of return" to Palestine, and the aspirations of more than three million Palestinians who wish to come back to the homes from which they were expelled in the wars of 1948 and 1967.
Arafat's successor as President of the Palestinian National Authority will be bound by the Oslo Accords, which created an interim government, now headed by Prime Minister Ahmad Qurei, that is responsible for the day-to-day lives of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.
Palestinians will have to decide whether to make the position of PNA president a powerful one or merely symbolic, as it now is.
The latter option would make Qurei an empowered prime minister, which is what many Palestinians and others want.
The position of the commander of the Palestinian forces supposedly puts the various Palestinian military, security, and intelligence units under one leader, who is expected to ensure the rule of law.
But these forces are now in disarray, with most uniformed Palestinian security agencies needing to be reorganized after four years of intensive effort by Israel to crush them.
The key factor in internal security is local paramilitary units.
These units, most of which are not controlled by the PNA's central leadership, are more loyal to grassroots figures than to uniformed PNA officers.
Local Fatah leaders like Marwan Barghouti have tremendous power over the nationalist armed units that are loosely organized under the title of the Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades.
Barghouti advocated and was trying to implement internal Fatah elections when the Israelis arrested him.
As a street leader who was elected as the head of the Bir Zeit University student council, he gained legitimacy by being chosen by his peers.
When the Oslo process began, he refused to accept any official position within the Palestinian Authority, choosing instead to remain close to the local Fatah cadres.
Whoever fills Arafat's shoes will need to make sure that these brigades are satisfied that their status, demands, and leaders are respected.
Indeed, the power struggle that will ensue in the post-Arafat era will ultimately center on Al Fatah, the backbone of the PLO.
A worldwide assembly chooses Fatah's 100-member revolutionary council, which in turn elects a 20-member central committee, where most of the power struggle will take place.
Many young street leaders will insist on an emergency meeting of the revolutionary council, or even holding the sixth general assembly (which would be the first since 1988).
Events in recent months show that the Al Asqa Martyrs' Brigades have forced even Arafat to take their demands into consideration.
While much of the power struggle will take place within the nationalist camp, one must not overlook the Islamist camp led by Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
Although the Islamists are unlikely to interfere in the post-Arafat power struggle, they will not sit idly by if the new leadership moves in what they consider the wrong direction.
Of course, the new leadership will have to reach some agreement with the Islamists regarding the rules of the game, both domestically and vis-à-vis Israel.
Without such an agreement, and if the new leadership cracks down hard on the Islamists, a violent civil war could erupt.
Most importantly, in order to consolidate his leadership, the next Palestinian leader must make some hard decisions and show some tangible results quickly.
The experience of the first Palestinian prime minister, who resigned largely because of his inability to deliver any improvements to his people -- particularly personal and collective security, the rule of law, and an end to chaos in Palestinian areas -- remains fresh in the public's memory.
At the same time, a freeze on settlement activities, release of Palestinian political prisoners -- including Marwan Barghouti -- and the removal of the hundreds of checkpoints between Palestinian cities would revive a feeling of hope, without which no Palestinian leader can negotiate what the world wants: a peace settlement.
The problem is that no Palestinian leader, no matter who he is, can deliver these changes.
They represent a direct challenge to the Israeli occupiers, neighboring Arab countries, and the international community, led by the United States.
The Moscow Mystery of 2008
Usually at this time of year, people are obsessed with what the coming year will bring.
But in Russia, the real uncertainty concerns 2008, not 2007.
Indeed, one can boil Russian politics down to one issue nowadays: Will President Vladimir Putin stay on as president after 2008, despite repeatedly stating that he won't?
And if he indeed steps down, whom will he groom as his replacement?
Will his chosen successor belong to one of the Kremlin's feuding factions?
Or will he pick an "outsider"?
Unless Putin maintains his stature as the country's ultimate arbiter and decision-taker, there is a high risk of fierce infighting.
In an environment where power and property are inseparable and all government institutions are emasculated, a major transfer of authority at the top may lead to violent redistribution.
Thus, resolving these questions is vital for Russia's political elites who are anxious to preserve the current perks and gain more.
As for the public, the vast majority appears resigned to accepting whatever is arranged by the leadership.
Fully 45% of Russians believe that Putin will name a successor, and that this person will become the new president.
Almost a quarter believe that the constitution will be changed so that Putin can have a third term.
Either way, it is almost universally understood that the transfer of presidential authority is masterminded at the top and endorsed at the ballot box.
The balance of forces in the legislature, too, will be determined by the Kremlin.
Over the past years the configuration of the political parties and the election legislation have been repeatedly modified so as to suit the interests of the ruling elite.
As a result unwanted forces have no chance in next December's parliamentary election.
Alienated from politics, ordinary Russians are indifferent to everything that does not immediately affect them, and do not seek to hold anyone accountable.
They were not bothered by the journalist Anna Politkovskaya's recent murder or the assassination of Andrey Kozlov, first deputy chairman of the central bank, or the implications of Alexander Litvinenko's poisoning (a majority in a recent poll said he was killed by his "business partners").
The alienation between the state and the people has a long tradition in Russia, and so does public apathy.
But these days the apathy is reinforced by improved living standards.
Thanks to windfall revenues from oil and gas, Russians live better than ever in the postcommunist times.
Moreover, it may be argued that never in Russian history has the proportion of those who enjoy reasonably decent lifestyles been as high as it is today.
As a result, people have become even more compliant in the face of increasingly autocratic governance.
Of course, there are plenty of reasons to complain, and people may grumble, but they won't come together to oppose the status quo.
Marginal political groups and figures who stage protests increasingly find themselves confronting official pressure and even harassment -- all the more reason for the broad public to turn away from them.
Since the election results are preordained, many may simply not vote.
In fact, today's Russian state barely has a reason to muster active support.
On the contrary, public participation is seen as an obstacle to the goals pursued by the bureaucracy: self-perpetuation and expanding control over lucrative assets.
If any among the Russian elite ever nursed modernizing ambitions, they have abandoned them, for without public participation, modernization is a fallacy.
Instead, the Kremlin increasingly draws on the conservative, Soviet-style electorate as its power base, while alienating the advanced, the entrepreneurial, and the best educated.
Stephen Jennings, the chairman of the board of Renaissance Capital, an investment group with a decade of experience in Russia, recently noted the country's "contradictory trends": the emergence of a "burgeoning middle class" alongside a "highly centralized government, breeding a new class of state oligarchs and a mushrooming bureaucracy."
The problem is that Russia's best and brightest, which Jennings praised for "high management skills, professionalism, productivity, and social and economic ambition," don't seem to mind their alienation from policy-making.
They may resent the Kremlin's economic policies, but they put up with Russia's rampant corruption and its disgraceful ratings in competitiveness indices, just as they put up with the general erosion of democracy, manipulation of the judiciary, and weak law enforcement.
Like their less advanced compatriots, they don't seek to hold the government accountable or call for change.
For the time being, life is good enough as it is.
Thus, if there is any threat to a smooth transition in 2008, or a risk of subsequent destabilization, it may stem from infighting at the top, not from the public.
Optimists hope that at some point Russia's burgeoning middle class will assume responsibility for Russia's future and demand a radical improvement in governance.
But what would trigger a shift from passive compliance to active public participation?
If good times breed political apathy, and bad policies lead to a socioeconomic decline, Russia's best and brightest may find themselves outstripped by populist forces.
The Anti-Drug God that Failed
Russians and Ukrainians are once again being made victims of a utopian dream.
Since the end of communism in 1991, these countries (and others) have experienced a dramatic increase in the use of illicit drugs.
They have responded with draconian policies that mirror the simplistic message of a drug-free society espoused by UN drug treaties and the institutions that seek to enforce them.
Today, these policies are contributing to an explosion of HIV infections in much of the developing world.
The UN treaties that guide global drug policy reflect none of the recent findings on drug use and addiction.
Indeed, most UN drug conventions were enacted long before the appearance of HIV/AIDS--a disease fuelled by injection drug use in the former Soviet Union and many parts of Asia.
Consider Russia and Ukraine, which have the world's fastest-growing rate of HIV infection.
The number of people infected with HIV in Russia and Ukraine has increased by more than 18 times over the past five years.
As many as 1.5 million Russians and 400,000 Ukrainians are estimated to have HIV; at least 85% of known infections are attributed to intravenous drug use.
Governments in Russia and Ukraine allocate the bulk of their drug-related resources to law enforcement in a misguided attempt to comply with the UN drug treaties.
Individual users suffer police abuse and are driven away from vital health and treatment services.
Meanwhile, the flow of drugs continues undiminished.
Repressive policies have never succeeded in eliminating demand for drugs.
They do not tackle any of the economic, social, or health factors associated with the use of illicit drugs.
Locking up drug users is not a solution--in Russia, it is easier to score drugs in prison than outside.
Moreover, in a repressive climate, drug users who avoid arrest are more likely to face increased discrimination, reducing their motivation to take measures to protect their own health and the health of those around them.
In such circumstances--without hope for a better future or the opportunity for compassion-based interaction with society--drug use and HIV spread rapidly.
Russia and Ukraine are not alone in facing these twin epidemics.
Pakistan, Iran, China, the Central Asian countries, and other places with rising rates of intravenous drug use are bound for the same public health catastrophe if they pursue similar discredited policies.
Public health intervention to reduce the damage caused by drugs has been proven--by decades of research in dozens of countries--to be vastly more effective at lowering HIV infection rates and healthcare costs.
Using a conservative model, the British medical journal Lancet estimated that the US would have recorded net savings of $500 million if it had implemented a national syringe exchange program between 1987-1995.
Similarly, an international survey found that HIV infection among intravenous drug users decreased by 5.8% per year in cities with syringe exchange programs, and increased by 5.9% per year in cities without such programs.
No major study has shown that syringe exchange programs increase rates of drug use.
Indeed, studies in the US, Australia, and elsewhere show that drug treatment rates tend to remain steady or rise, because syringe exchange participants gain greater access to rehabilitative care.
UN agencies such as the Commission on Narcotic Drugs or the Office on Drugs and Crime are not mandated to prescribe specific drug strategies.
However, their narrowly focused anti-drug stance strongly influences the policies and practices of member nations.
Many individual governments, obsessed with compliance, are unable or unwilling to consider the negative public health effects of harsh anti-drug policies.
International institutions chose to look the other way in the 1990's as HIV/AIDS killed millions in Africa, infecting more than 25% of the population in some countries.
Because of similar ignorance, this terrible epidemic now looms over the former Soviet Union and other regions.
Have we really learned nothing?
It is not too late for international and national policymakers to reconsider their strategies.
In defiance of the UN conventions, some countries have adopted more pragmatic approaches to dealing with drug use and HIV.
By treating drug use first and foremost as a problem of public health, nations can fight the spread of HIV far more effectively.
To achieve this, they should take the following steps:
· Adopt anti-discrimination and equal-protection laws to guarantee the civil liberties and human rights of drug users and people living with HIV;
· Acknowledge drug use as a public health issue, not a law-and-order issue, with government policies reflecting this reality;
· Explicitly legalize needle exchange and the use of methadone and other "substitute" medications for treatment;
· Create national programs that encompass a full range of pragmatic, inclusive, and accessible harm reduction services, from education and drug treatment to substitution therapy and needle exchange;
· Include drug users and their advocates in developing policies on drug use at both international and national levels.
Continuing resistance to calls to restructure anti-drug strategies and goals will only worsen the HIV epidemic and contribute to the deaths of millions of vulnerable people.
Dump the Lisbon Agenda
As soon as he takes office as President of the European Commission, Durao Barroso - Portugal's former Prime Minister - should devote urgent attention to restoring order and focus to the European Union's economic policies.
The thickest file on his desk concerns the Lisbon agenda, an ambitious programme approved in 2000 by the EU heads of state and government with the goal of making the Union "the most competitive and dynamic knowledge economy" by 2010.
All major fields of economic policy are covered: innovation and entrepreneurship, welfare reform and social inclusion, skills and employability, gender equality, labour and product market liberalisation, and "sustainable" development.
All of these are worthy goals, to be sure, but they belong intrinsically to the sphere of national political decisions.
Indeed, under the European Treaties, the Union has no competence to enact legislation and policy in these domains, nor powers to enforce them.
But the European Council, spurred by the European Commission, invented a new policy approach - called "open coordination" - in order to impinge on these fields.
Open coordination entails the definition of common goals at the EU level, voluntary compliance by the member states, and peer review of results within the European Council.
Inevitably, open coordination has failed to deliver on its promises.
Moreover, the delusion that the European Council can somehow call growth and productivity into being has provided a diversion to national politicians who are unwilling to push for unpopular decisions back home.
My first suggestion to Barroso, therefore, is to scrap the Lisbon agenda.
Only this will make it clear that responsibility for national economic performance lies with national policy-makers.
This brings me to the subject of macroeconomic coordination at the EU level.
The Maastricht Treaty envisaged a simple policy framework for economic and monetary union.
Monetary policy was centralized and entrusted to an independent central bank, while fiscal policy was left to the member states.
National governments were made subject - under the excessive-deficit procedure - to the twin constraints that fiscal deficits should not exceed 3% of GDP and government debt should remain below 60% of GDP (or at least tend towards that value).
Later on, the Stability and Growth Pact added a requirement that, over the medium term, government accounts should be "close to balance."
Essentially, this aimed to prevent irresponsible budgetary policies after the euro's launch, while leaving sufficient room for cyclical oscillations of the deficit within the 3% limit.
The credibility of this apparatus was badly damaged by the November 2003 public controversy between the Commission and the Ecofin Council over the application of the excessive-deficit procedure to France and Germany.
This does not mean that it should be abandoned.
On the contrary, a common external constraint on fiscal behavior is needed as a joint safeguard against an unsustainable accumulation of public debt that could affect financial stability and inflation throughout the EU - a risk aggravated by the impact of aging populations on pension systems.
Such a constraint also provides a welcome anchor for domestic decision-making in member states with weaker political systems.
But the system needs to be reviewed.
I would not listen to those who advocate excluding investment from fiscal deficits: this would only offer new incentives for creative accounting and unsustainable accumulation of debt.
Instead, the emphasis should shift from annual deficits to debt sustainability.
The debt criterion, for example, could be supplemented by a limit on the (trend) growth rate of public spending, which would be kept below that of nominal GDP.
The Commission's powers to initiate action when there is a risk of excessive deficits should be strengthened - provided, of course, that the Commission never again forgets that surveillance of national policies is a task that requires political judgment and cannot be left to accountants and lawyers.
Finally, top priority should be assigned to completing the Single European Market, in which the Union has powerful legal instruments to pry open markets and sustain competition.
The best therapy for reinvigorating growth is both direct, by increasing competitive pressure, and indirect, by triggering the necessary adaptation in national employment, welfare, and education policies.
The job is far from finished.
State aid to ailing companies remains ubiquitous, and common rules designed to ensure free circulation of goods and services are not fully respected by the member states - public procurement and energy markets being prime examples.
Moreover, most markets for services - securities trading, wholesale and retail distribution, business services, and local utilities - remain sheltered from competition and free circulation rules.
Empirical evidence indicates that these distortions in the market for services, which account for about two thirds of GDP, underlie most of the EU's productivity gap with the United States.
In recent years the European Council has not devoted sufficient attention to these tasks, which require full and continuing commitment by member states to transpose and implement Community directives.
All too often, the Commission has favored enacting new legislation and creating new spending programs over the effective administration of what already exists.
So Barroso should forget the high-flying platitudes of the Lisbon agenda and focus instead on effective completion of the Single Market and keeping the member states' fiscal policies in order.
Let national governments take responsibility for their countries' economic performance.
The Emotional Clash of Civilizations
Throughout the so-called "war on terror," the notion of a "clash of civilization" between Islam and the West has usually been dismissed as politically incorrect and intellectually wrongheaded.
Instead, the most common interpretation has been that the world has entered a new era characterized by conflict "within" a particular civilization, namely Islam, with fundamentalist Muslims as much at war against moderates as against the West.
The strategic conclusion derived from such an analysis was clear, ambitious, and easily summarized: democratization.
If the absence of democracy in the Islamic world was the problem, bringing democracy to the "Greater Middle-East would be the solution, and it was the historical duty of the United States, as the most powerful and moral nation, to bring about that necessary change.
The status quo was untenable.
Implementing democracy, with or without regime change, was the only alternative to chaos and the rise of fundamentalism.
Today, Iraq may be on the verge of civil war between Shiites and Sunnis.
Iran under a new and more radical president is moving irresistibly towards possessing a nuclear capacity.
A free electoral process brought Hamas to power in Palestine, and the unfortunate episode of the Danish newspaper cartoons illustrated the almost combustible nature of relations between Islam and the West.
All of these developments are paving the way to new interpretations.
Rather than a "clash of civilizations," we might instead be faced by multiple layers of conflict, which interact with each other in ways that increase global instability.
Indeed, it appears that the world is witnessing a triple conflict.
There is a clash within Islam, which, if the violence in Iraq spreads to neighboring countries, risks causing regional destabilization.
There is also a clash that is best described not as being between Islam and the West, but between the secularized world and a growing religious one.
At an even deeper and atavistic level, there is an emotional clash between a culture of fear and a culture of humiliation.
It would be a gross oversimplification to speak, as some are doing, of a clash between civilization and barbarism.
In reality, we are confronted with a widening divide over the role of religion, which runs between the West (with the US being a complicated exception) and much of the rest of the world (the most notable exception being China), but particularly the Islamic world.
The divide reflects how religion defines an individual's identity within a society.
At a time when religion is becoming increasingly important elsewhere, we Europeans have largely forgotten our (violent and intolerant) religious past, and we have difficulty understanding the role that religion can play in other peoples' daily lives.
In some ways, "they" are our own buried past and, with a combination of ignorance, prejudice, and, above all, fear, "we" are afraid that "they" could define our future.
We live in a secular world, where free speech can easily turn into insensitive and irresponsible mockery, while others see religion as their supreme goal, if not their last hope.
They have tried everything, from nationalism to regionalism, from communism to capitalism.
Since everything has failed, why not give God a chance?
Globalization may not have created these layers of conflicts, but it has accelerated them by making the differences more visible and palpable.
In our globalized age, we have lost the privilege -- and, paradoxically, the virtue -- of ignorance.
We all see how others feel and react, but without the minimal historical and cultural tools necessary to decipher those reactions.
Globalization has paved the way to a world dominated by the dictatorship of emotions -- and of ignorance.
This clash of emotions is exacerbated in the case of Islam.
In the Arab world, in particular, Islam is dominated by a culture of humiliation felt by the people and nations that consider themselves the main losers, the worst victims, of a new and unjust international system.
From that standpoint, the Israel-Palestine conflict is exemplary.
It has become an obsession.
It is not so much that Arabs and Muslims really care about the Palestinians.
On the contrary, the Islamic world left the Palestinians without real support for decades.
In reality, for them the conflict has come to symbolize the anachronistic perpetuation of an unfair colonial order, to represent their political malaise, and to embody the perceived impossibility of their being masters of their destiny.
In the eyes of the Arabs (and some other Muslims), Israel's strength and resilience is a direct consequence of their own weakness, divisions, and corruption.
The majority of Arabs may not support al-Qaeda, but they do not oppose it with all their heart.
Instead, there is the temptation to regard Osama bin Laden as a type of violent Robin Hood, whose actions, while impossible to condone officially, have helped them to recover a sense of Arab pride and dignity.
Here, perhaps, is the real clash of civilizations: the emotional conflict between the European culture of fear and the Muslim, particularly Arab, culture of humiliation.
It would be dangerous to underestimate the depth of so wide an emotional divide, and to recognize its existence is the first step to overcoming it.
But that will be difficult, for transcending the emotional clash of civilizations presupposes an opening to the "other" that neither side may yet be ready to undertake.
Globalization and Anti-Americanism
Anti-American sentiments are rising around the world.
American Democrats say that President Bush's policies have squandered America's attractiveness.
Republicans reply that America is bound to be resented because of its size and its association with globalization.
Anti-Americanism, they say, will persist because some people see America as a cultural threat.
I believe that such views lack historical perspective.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, globalization is not homogenizing and Americanizing the cultures of the world.
Although the United States is at the forefront of the current information revolution, which is creating many similarities in social and cultural habits (such as television viewing or Internet use) that are attributed to Americanization, correlation is not causation.
To see why, imagine a country that introduced computers and communications at a rapid rate in a world in which America did not exist.
You would still expect major social and cultural changes from such modernization.
Of course, because the US exists and is at the forefront of the information revolution, there is a degree of Americanization, but that is likely to diminish over the course of the twenty-first century as technology spreads and local cultures modernize in their own ways.
Historical proof that globalization does not necessarily mean homogenization can be seen in Japan, a country that deliberately isolated itself from earlier waves of globalization.
In the middle of the nineteenth century, Japan became the first Asian country to embrace globalization, and to borrow successfully from the world without losing its uniqueness.
During the Meiji Restoration, Japan searched broadly for tools and innovations that would allow it to become a major power rather than a victim of Western imperialism.
It sent young people to the West for education.
Its delegations scoured the world for ideas in science, technology, and industry.
In the political realm, Meiji reformers were well aware of Anglo-American ideas and institutions, but deliberately turned to German models because they were deemed more suitable to a country with an emperor.
The lesson that Japan teaches the rest of the world is not simply that an Asian country can compete, but that after a century and a half of globalization, it is possible to adapt while preserving a unique culture.
More fundamentally, the image of a homogenizing America reflects a mistakenly static view of culture.
Efforts to portray local cultures as unchanging often reflect reactionary political strategies rather than descriptions of reality.
As the Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa has put it, those who argue in favor of cultural identity and against globalization, betray a stagnant attitude towards culture that is not borne out by historical fact.
Do we know of any cultures that have remained unchanged through time?
To find any of them one has to travel to the small, primitive, magico-religious communities made up of people… who due to their primitive condition, become progressively more vulnerable to exploitation and extermination.
Vibrant cultures are constantly changing and borrowing from other cultures - and that borrowing is not always from the US.
For example, many more countries turned to Canada than to America as an example for framing constitutions in the aftermath of the Cold War.
Globalization is also a two-edged sword.
In some areas, there is not only a backlash against American cultural imports, but an effort to change American culture itself.
Capital punishment may now be supported by a majority of Americans, but the death penalty is regarded as an egregious violation of human rights across Europe - indeed, across much of the world.
American environmental attitudes toward climate change or genetic modification of food bring similar criticism.
More subtly, America's openness to immigration both enriches and changes American culture.
Finally, globalization and the information revolution may reinforce rather than reduce cultural diversity.
Some French commentators express fear that in a world of Internet global marketing, there will no longer be room for a culture that cherishes hundreds of different types of cheese.
But on the contrary, the Internet allows dispersed customers to come together in a way that encourages niche markets, including hundreds of Web sites dedicated only to cheese.
The Internet also allows people to establish a more diverse set of political communities.
The use of the Welsh language in Britain and Gaelic in Ireland is greater today than fifty years ago.
Britain, Belgium, and Spain, among others in Europe, have devolved more power to local regions.
The global information age may strengthen rather than weaken local cultures.
Economic and social globalization does produce superficial similarities in T-shirt logos and soft drink brands, but an underlying cultural diversity will remain.
American culture is now prominent, and it contributes to America's attractiveness - its "soft power" - in many, but not all, areas.
At the same time, immigrants, ideas, and events outside America's borders are changing American culture within the borders of the US.
As globalization spreads technical capabilities, and information technology allows broader participation in global communications, American economic and cultural preponderance may diminish.
A little less dominance may mean a little less anxiety about Americanization, fewer complaints about American arrogance, and less intensity in the anti-American backlash.
The US may have less control in the future, but it may find itself living in a world somewhat more congenial to its basic values of democracy, free markets, individual liberties, and human rights.
Why America Must Rejoin the World
The terrorist attacks on New York and Washington of September 11, 2001, profoundly changed the US, spawning a new focus on foreign policy.
The Bush administration's new national security strategy, issued in September 2002, identifies the combination of terrorism, rogue states, and weapons of mass destruction as the primary threat confronting America.
Most people agree with the new focus of American foreign policy, but debate the means by which it is carried out.
Is the threat so great that America must act alone, or should the US act only with the support of international institutions, even if that holds the country back?
Events in Iraq illustrate this debate, but it has deeper roots.
In his 2000 election campaign, George W. Bush said about America, "If we are an arrogant nation, they'll view us that way, but if we're a humble nation, they'll respect us."
He was right, but unfortunately many of America's friends saw the first eight months of his administration as arrogantly concerned with narrow American interests, focused on military power, and dismissive of treaties, norms, and multilateralism.
The administration's peremptory announcement that the Kyoto Protocol on global climate change was "dead" contributed to a reaction from other countries that cost the US its seat on the UN Human Rights Commission.
September 11 supposedly changed all that.
Congress finally paid to the United Nations America's debts, and the president has focused its efforts on a coalition against terrorism.
But quick success of war in Afghanistan has led administration members and commentators to conclude the proper functioning of unilateralism. The columnist Charles Krauthammer, for example, advocates a "new unilateralism" in which America refuses to play the role of "international docile citizen" and went his own unscrupulous aims.
The new unilateralists make a mistake in focusing too heavily on military power alone.
True, America's military power--backed up by a budget equivalent to the next eight countries combined -is essential to global stability, and an essential part of the response to terrorism.
But the metaphor of war should not blind us to the fact that suppressing terrorism will take years of patient, unspectacular civilian cooperation with other countries in areas such as intelligence sharing, police work, tracing financial flows, and cooperation among customs officials.
Military success in Afghanistan addressed the easiest part of the problem.
Al Qaeda retains cells in some fifty countries.
Rather than proving the unilateralists' point, the partial nature of the success in Afghanistan illustrates the continuing need for cooperation.
Similarly, it was much easier to win the war in Iraq than to win the peace.
The problem for Americans in the 21
The US lacks both the international and domestic prerequisites to resolve conflicts internal to other societies, and to monitor and control transnational transactions that threaten Americans at home.
On many of today's key issues, such as international financial stability, drug smuggling, the spread of diseases, or global climate change, military power is ineffective.
Indeed, its use can be counterproductive.
America must instead mobilize international coalitions to address these shared threats and challenges.
The willingness of others to cooperate depends in part on their own self-interest, but also on the attractiveness of American positions.
That power to attract is what I call "soft power."
It means that others want what you want, and there is less need to use carrots and sticks to make others do what you want.
Hard power grows out of a country's military and economic might.
Soft power arises from the attractiveness of a country's culture, ideals, and policies.
Hard power will always remain vital, but soft power will become increasingly important in dealing with transnational issues whose resolution requires multilateral cooperation.
To be sure, no large country can afford to be purely multilateralist, and sometimes the US must take the lead, as it did in Afghanistan.
But in Iraq, President Bush should have followed his father's example and built a broad international coalition.
Now, as his administration returns to the UN to seek a new resolution that will enable other countries to contribute troops and resources for peacekeeping and reconstruction in Iraq, he is paying the price for the way he went to war.
Granted, multilateralism can be used by smaller states to restrict American freedom of action, but this does not mean that it is not generally in American interests.
By embedding US policies in multilateral frameworks, America can make its disproportionate power more legitimate and acceptable.
Even well intentioned Americans are not immune to Lord Acton's famous warning that power tends to corrupt.
Learning to listen to others and to define US interests broadly to include global interests will be crucial to American soft power and whether others see the American preponderance as benign or not.
The paradox of American power is that the largest power since Rome cannot achieve many of its objectives unilaterally in a global information age.
America needs to pay more attention to soft power and to multilateral cooperation.
That is the real lesson of September 11
Socialism or Global Division?
For the first time in history, we have the knowledge, the technology, and the wealth to design a different world.
We have the resources to "make poverty history."
But, though we have the power to change the world, we are not taking the steps needed to do so.
In 2000, the world's governments adopted the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, which aim to halve global poverty by 2015.
Yet the international community has lacked the political will needed to meet these basic responsibilities to humanity, causing people to lose faith in politics.
Unless we take action, our citizens will lose hope in the power of democracy -- or find hope in extremism, fundamentalism, and violence.
To restore people's trust not only in politics, but also in their own potential, our policies must guarantee responsible governance and institutions that work for and with responsible citizens.
As the largest political organization in the world, the Socialist International can unite the world's citizens around a new global agenda to achieve these goals.
Our first challenge is to democratize globalization.
We must reconfigure globalization from the bottom-up, bringing in the two-thirds of the human race that is currently excluded from the process, on terms that reflect the socialist principles of inclusion, cultural diversity, and sustainable development.
How can citizens have a democratic say in world economic development when the IMF and World Bank work on the principle of "one dollar, one vote"?
There can be no real democracy when we have a massive concentration of capital and power in the hands of the few; when multinational corporations challenge the power of democratically elected representatives; when organized criminals can buy off police officers, judges, and politicians; when monopolization of the media erodes fundamental freedoms.
Democratizing globalization will take time.
But we can accelerate the process by strengthening regional cooperation and integration.
This calls for new channels of cooperation with progressive forces in other parts of the world -- in China, the United States, India, and the Arab world.
To tackle global problems, we need to strengthen and democratize international institutions like the United Nations.
But we need to look beyond reform of the Security Council and start creating a democratic global architecture that puts globalization at the service of citizens, not markets.
Today, the top priority for socialists is to re-establish a balance between economic productivity and social justice.
While we have some successful precedents, such as the Nordic model, it is difficult for nations to achieve this balance.
As capitalist markets give way to vast commercial networks, and as market economies become market societies, governments and unions are increasingly restricted in scope.
This has disempowered and divided our citizens.
Citizens of developed countries increasingly feel like mere objects of consumerism, while citizens of developing countries struggle for daily survival.
In both cases, but in different ways, people feel impoverished.
To be sure, we have very diverse societies, but we also face new forms of inequality.
Lack of labor standards in one part of the world undermines the social welfare of workers in other parts of the world.
Mass migration from poor countries has created fear and xenophobia in richer countries, especially among the working class.
Similarly, free trade has turned farmers and service workers in the developing and developed world against each other.
Environmental concerns have become a "blame game."
The developed world fears the depletion of vital resources by the developing world, which in turn blames the developed world for destroying the environment in pursuit of profit.
To bridge these divides, we must rethink the nature of employment in an increasingly automated, borderless, and mobile global economy.
As capital is globalized, so basic labor standards should be global.
Forced labor, child labor, and discrimination in the workplace must be eliminated.
We must also make our own politics more democratic.
We must fight exclusion from our political parties, just as we fight exclusion in our societies.
This means welcoming migrants and minorities, creating more opportunities for women and the disabled, and empowering citizens through education and participation.
Empowering citizens means giving them both the power to decide and the knowledge to decide well.
In PASOK, the Greek Socialist party that I lead, we are undertaking far-reaching reforms in this direction.
Likewise, the goal of the Socialist International is a world governed not by free markets, but by free people.
The Indian Tortoise and the Chinese Hare
"India everywhere" was the theme at this year's World Economic Forum.
In the West, there is so much focus on China that India's achievements are often acknowledged only as an afterthought.
As if to underscore the point that political stability must triumph in the long run, the Indians plastered Swiss buses with the banner: "India: The World's Fastest Growing Democracy."
The India media blitz was a huge success.
In Davos, speaker after speaker touted the idea that even if China is ahead now, over the longer run, the race between Asia's two giants is a toss-up.
For a few days at least, India's emergence as a superpower on par with China was taken as a fait accompli.
But what is the reality in the race between economies with more than a billion people each?
On the surface, China has opened up quite a lead on India.
Twenty-five years ago, at the start of the contemporary wave of globalization, national output in India and China was about the same.
Now, by any measure, China is more than twice as rich.
But the real difference is not so much that successful Chinese are doing better than successful Indians.
After all, the Indian elite are world-beaters, as Lakshmi Mittal's bold $22 billion bid for French steelmaker Arcelor shows.
No, the real difference -- whether we like to admit it or not -- is that China's communist government has succeeded in globalizing a much larger share of its population than India's democratic government has managed to do.
Not that China is exactly egalitarian.
It is only along the coast, home to roughly one in three Chinese citizens, that most people can be said to have really joined the twenty-first century.
Much of rural China is still miserable, with 150 million people effectively unemployed and health and education standards often befitting an earlier century.
But caste-bound India's record of exclusion is worse.
Perhaps only one in five persons are integrated into the global economy.
For every call center employee, there are many more people still eking out a subsistence living on the land.
Whereas China probably has about 450 million people in its globalized economy, India has at most 200-250 million.
It is this difference, more than anything else, that sets the two economies apart.
What can India do to close the gap?
Its biggest shortcoming is its lack of roads, bridges, ports, and other infrastructure, where the contrast with China is just stunning.
If your products can't get to the global economy, you cannot conquer it.
Over the past five years, China has multiplied its highway system five-fold.
Its 50,000 kilometers of new roads are built to handle even large aircraft, which is more than one can say about some of the runways at India's shambolic airports.
It is not just a matter of money -- India's central bank is rolling in cash, which it has mainly invested in low-yield foreign treasury bills.
The real problem is that China's authoritarian system faces little opposition when it decides to bulldoze a shantytown that stands in the way of a new airport.
India's government, by contrast, has neither the power nor the inclination to trample over poor people to make rich people richer.
Unfortunately, without infrastructure, the 800 million-plus Indians who have not yet "made it" don't have a chance.
India will never be able to create enough jobs in services alone; it must be able to compete in low-end manufacturing areas as well.
Without better infrastructure, the majority of India's citizens will remain frozen out of globalization.
So, is the idea that India's economy could overtake China's hopeless romanticism?
Not necessarily, if only because the areas where India excels, notably services, have far higher potential margins than manufacturing.
Here, the Chinese, hampered by a vastly inferior legal system, will not be able to compete easily.
Western companies are far more inclined to trust Indian firms with sensitive financial information or patents than they are in the case of China.
Foreign companies know that if they outsource any high-tech process to China, they might as well publish their blueprints on the Internet.
India also has a much better developed financial system than China, an advantage that will be increasingly important as the two countries develop.
Command and control financing ("directed lending," as economists call it) works well when it comes to building bridges; it is a lot less effective when it comes to choosing what companies deserve to survive.
The challenge for the Indians, and, indeed, for other emerging markets like Brazil, Russia, and Mexico, is that they need to find ways to broaden the successful sectors of their economies without strangling them.
If India is to ever catch up with China, it must globalize more of its citizens, through better provision of health, education and infrastructure.
Only then will we truly start seeing "India everywhere."
Russia's Skeptical G8 Partners
Poor oil-rich Russia.
It is trying so hard to have its turn as chair of the elite Group of Eight countries taken seriously.
President Vladimir Putin, perhaps hoping to elevate the presidential summit talks in St. Petersburg in July, has laid out an ambitious agenda.
He plans to lead his colleagues in erudite conversations about education, infectious diseases, and -- to make sure that no one dozes off -- "energy security."
And what has Putin gotten for his efforts?
Not much.
The Bush administration, led by Vice President Dick Cheney (but with his boss's explicit approval), recently accused Russia of backsliding into its old "evil empire" ways.
Putin shot back, portraying the United States as "Comrade Wolf," ready to pounce on any nation that leaves itself vulnerable.
Suspense seems to be building around how Bush and Putin will greet each other when they meet in St. Petersburg.
Europeans, for their part, are still hysterical about getting caught up in the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute that left their pipelines dry for a few days at the beginning of this year.
They see discussing "energy security" with Russia as akin to chatting about water safety with Comrade Crocodile.
Of course, people who really want to be unkind will point out the absurdity of Russia's membership in a club that includes the giant economies of US, Germany, Japan, England, France, Italy, and (less so) Canada.
Why wasn't Chinese president Hu Jintao, whose country's economy is the world's second largest (when measured at world prices), given a seat at the table instead of Putin?
After all, even with all its energy resources, and even with today's sky-high oil and gas prices, Russia's national income is only about the size of Greater Los Angeles.
Perhaps what Putin needs to do is stop suffering all the criticisms and go on the offensive.
He could start by pointing out to his smugly democratic counterparts that he is probably more popular in Russia today than any of them are in their own countries.
He might actually win a fair election tomorrow (not that he would ever risk finding out).
Few of the others could make the same claim with a straight face.
Of course, Putin's success over the past few years in killing off any semblance of a free press -- and when an ex-KGB man "kills off" a free press, it is not just a figure of speech -- has helped mute open opposition.
Even so, Putin does seem genuinely popular among a public longing for a leader who can anchor their country without sinking it.
Putin might also argue that Russia's fiscal position is far stronger that of the other G8 members.
Yes, it helps that Siberia turned out to be a giant oil well, with the government sucking up much of the money.
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is balancing his country's books, too, for now.
But, to be fair, oil is not the whole story.
Most economists advocate rich countries' replacing their complex and antiquated tax codes with a simple low flat tax, and they bemoan the fact that so few countries have tried it.
Putin, however, implemented such a policy a few years ago, and the results have been nothing short of miraculous.
Of course, the other G8 leaders might be less enamored of some of Russia's other approaches to addressing budget problems.
Most G8 countries seem incapable of achieving the political consensus required to take necessary steps such as raising the retirement age or significantly cutting the indexation of benefits to inflation.
Russia, by contrast, has essentially abandoned its pensioners by inflating away the value of their incomes.
Indeed, many of the elderly in rural Russia are forced to sustain themselves by growing potatoes on the tiny plots of land that the government allows them to till.
That is, assuming they survive at all: since the fall of the Berlin Wall, Russian male life expectancy has plummeted from 65 years to around 60 years.
There is growing evidence that the stress of transition is the leading cause of death, even above big killers in postcommunist Russia such as alcohol, murder, and AIDS.
Should Putin tell his colleagues that they, too, could balance their countries' intergenerational accounts by starving the elderly?
So perhaps Putin had better not try to push his country's accomplishments too far.
Maybe the best plan is simply to let the vodka flow and hope for a round of smiles in the photo ops.
In any case, when Putin tells his guests how they can pay Russia more to improve their own "energy security," he may finally get the respect that he craves.
The Economy of Fear
The global economy seems to be walking on water, shrugging off soaring oil prices, policy paralysis in Europe, unsustainable borrowing by the United States, and record housing prices.
Is it because, as G-8 leaders would have us believe, investors are in a buoyant mood, confident in their leaders' stewardship of the global economy?
Or are we being governed by a pathology of fear, fed by events such as the recent London bombings, that is holding down long-term interest rates thereby covering up a host of simmering problems?
The role of phenomenally low long-term (inflation-adjusted) interest rates in covering up a multitude of weaknesses in the global economy is all too apparent.
Soaring house prices worldwide are propping up consumer demand in many countries, and, according to a recent study by the International Monetary Fund, continually falling long-term interest rates explain two-thirds or more of the global price rise.
Europe has benefited less, but its economies would be a lot worse off if long-term interest rates climbed back to their 25-year average.
Similarly, Latin America has been booming in recent years, despite high debt burdens and a mixed record of policy reform.
Low long-term interest rates have kept the region's debts manageable, while high consumer demand has helped bid up prices for the region's commodity exports.
Why hasn't the huge spike in oil prices cut the world to its knees, as it has on so many other occasions?
Again, the answer is low interest rates.
Ordinarily, a sharp rise in oil prices quickly translates into higher inflation expectations, followed by rising interest rates at all maturities.
But this time, even as the US Federal Reserve keeps hiking its short-term lending rate to keep inflation in line, long-term interest rates -- which are far more important -- have been magically declining.
Indeed, America has been the single biggest beneficiary of this freakish low-interest-rate environment, with everyone seeming to borrow money like it is going out of style.
Homeowners, backed by rising house prices, are piling up debt.
The Federal government has thrown fiscal prudence out the window.
The country as a whole is absorbing an astounding three-quarters of global excess savings.
But, as long as interest rates remain low and growth high, Americans can laugh at predictions that their excesses are laying the seeds of ruin.
But if low long-term interest rates are helping so many economies walk on water, why are rates so low, and will they stay that way?
Perhaps the situation is far more fragile than many policymakers would have us believe.
Perhaps people have come to feel less , not more, secure about their long-term future, either because of fears about terrorism, a global pandemic, or a severe rash of financial crises.
I am not claiming that investors are hysterical, just that they may have become a bit more concerned about the long-term outlook.
As a consequence, they are crowding into bonds and debt instruments that they view, rightly or wrongly, as safe vehicles.
Other convincing explanations are lacking.
To be sure, emerging markets have been on an unusual savings spree, rebuilding reserves and improving balance sheets, but nobody expects this to go on forever.
Even US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan ordinarily the Oracle of Delphi on interest-rate matters, has declared the current situation "a conundrum."
History suggests that the global technology boom has yet to play itself out, with US productivity gains likely to radiate out across the world, raising growth rates everywhere.
Ordinarily, rapid global growth translates into high long-term interest rates -- that is, unless, deep down, people have become nervous.
Suppose investors are worried about a small chance of catastrophe over the next five to ten years.
(According to experts on nuclear terrorism and pandemics, the dangers are real.)
Suppose investors believe that growth will probably continue to be strong, but that maybe -- just maybe -- things will fall apart.
In this case, it is entirely possible to have very low interest rates co-exist with strong growth.
True, some economists point to the halcyon days of the 1950's and early 1960's, when Europe, the US, and Japan prospered, but interest rates generally remained well below the rate of economic growth.
Since that was a golden era for global growth, why worry if we are seeing the same phenomenon today?
What the optimists forget is that the 1950's and 1960's were also a period of massive insecurity.
Many people realistically feared the outbreak of World War III -- and with good reason, according to many historians.
Back then, the specter of the Apocalypse helped keep borrowing cheap.
Happily, investors' darkest fears were not realized, and we can only hope for the same.
But if insecurity is a major undercurrent of today's record-low interest rates, then G-8 leaders should be more cautious in their self-congratulation.
Investors' collective psychology is notoriously fragile.
If they ever calm down, interest rates will shoot up, and that could well bring the global economy's simmering imbalances to a raging boil.
Israel's Political Earthquake
Israeli politics is undergoing its most dramatic changes in 30 years.
The realignment of parties and leaders is all the more remarkable because the latest developments -- Ariel Sharon's decision to leave the ruling Likud party, the defeat of Shimon Peres as the Labor party's chairman, and Labor's withdrawal from Sharon's grand coalition government -- were utterly unexpected.
So it is all the more important to comprehend the significance of these changes for the future of Israel, the region, and the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Israel's political system is, to put it simply, coming to the end of its second era.
From independence in 1948 until 1977, the Labor party was dominant, before giving way to an opposition coalition of conservative, nationalist, and centrist parties allied in the Likud bloc.
Since then, the two parties have taken turns in power, sometimes in grand coalitions and often in partnership with smaller parties.
On the surface, party competition has been between "left" and "right," or "hawks" and "doves."
The truth, of course, is more complex.
Social class and economic issues, overshadowed by the persistence of more existential concerns -- physical security and the continued existence of the state -- have played a much less important role in Israel than in other societies.
Here, the political divide could be defined as "optimists" versus "pessimists."
The former, as in Labor, believed that some day a force would emerge among Arabs and Palestinians ready to make peace on a reasonable basis; the latter, as in Likud, were more doubtful.
For years, the argument remained an abstraction, a debate over what might happen in the future, until the Oslo agreement with the PLO in 1993 put the competing perspectives to the test.
Since 2000, when PLO leader Yasir Arafat rejected a political settlement and instead launched a five-year war of terrorism, there have been few optimists left.
The subsequent intellectual realignment in Israel has given rise to a new national consensus.
It is now generally accepted that, as the left has always insisted, Israel should be ready to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza Strip and accept a Palestinian state in exchange for real peace.
But it is also accepted that, as the right has always maintained, there is no partner ready to make real peace.
In this context, Sharon gained two landslide election victories as a hardliner, but implemented a moderate policy, including a full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.
This is where Israel stands today, facing a political upheaval fueled by two developments.
First, Sharon moved the Likud to the center, making it the hegemonic party, while destroying every stereotype about his personality, methods, and worldview.
For the same reason, though, many within Likud view Sharon -- who helped found the party -- as a traitor.
Sharon now needs to institutionalize his reforms, even if he now needs to establish another party to do so.
Second, the Labor party has proven politically bankrupt, with its only conceivable leader being the 82-year-old Shimon Peres and its anachronistic dovish optimism the source of much ridicule.
As a result -- and helped by low voter turnout -- the party's leadership primary was won by Amir Peretz, an outsider and populist who wants to revitalize Labor by putting social and economic issues at the forefront, which means withdrawing from the national unity coalition with Likud.
Despite having to form a new party, Sharon will probably win the next election, which he has called for February.
Peretz's strategy may draw voters from other parties on the left, but Labor will most likely lose centrist voters (and those for whom national security is paramount) to Sharon.
Paradoxically, all of this will mean both a great deal in principle and perhaps little in practice.
With Sharon enjoying a strong public mandate for a moderate policy, Israel will be more ready than ever to make a deal with the Palestinians, Syria, and the Arab world in general for a comprehensive diplomatic solution to the conflict.
Yet, given the chaos and paralysis that increasingly characterize Palestinian politics, that opportunity will go untaken.
The rising power of Hamas, which openly proclaims its strategy of increasing terrorism and its goal of destroying Israel, reinforces that trend.
The same can be said of Syria, whose hardline government is turning toward a dangerously adventurous militancy.
Sharon might decide on partial withdrawals and dismantling of settlements on the West Bank.
But it is now widely recognized that such changes are a response to dim prospects of real progress toward peace.
Holding onto territory as a bargaining chip makes less sense if there is no one with whom to bargain.
Instead, Israel will continue to prioritize its own security, strengthening its defenses against terrorism and consolidating control over the relatively small portions of the West Bank that it intends to claim as part of an eventual diplomatic settlement.
A byproduct of this strategy, combined with ongoing Palestinian attacks, has been growing international sympathy with Israel.
That, too, could continue if the current political realignment proves permanent, enabling Sharon to win over the center and even moderate left for his program.
Nothing is assured, of course.
The still popular Benjamin Netanyahu could emerge as a powerful rival on his right, and Peretz might yet shape Labor into a serious contender on his left.
Nevertheless, the national consensus has shifted, shaking all assumptions about Israeli politics.
The February elections will put those assumptions to their severest test in decades.
The Climate Change Agreement: Bridging Gaps through Science
Securing the Future at the Evian Summit
The paradox of our time is the great power of the world's richest countries to do good, but their seeming compulsion to miss every opportunity to do so.
The US stands as the supreme example of this: a country that devotes $450 billion per year to military spending allocates only $12 billion per year to development assistance for poor countries.
It can bomb Somalia, Afghanistan, and Iraq, but seems ill-equipped to help these places develop.
Europe is little better, paralyzed as it is by internal divisions and budget deficits.
Next week's G-8 summit in Evian, France is a chance to make a fresh start.
For the one billion people represented at the G-8 Summit, life is extremely good in comparison with the rest of the planet, with average incomes at $25,000 per person or more and life expectancy around 80 years.
For about three billion people in the world today, including China, much of India, and most of East Asia, economic development is proceeding reasonably well, even if it displays a lot of ups and downs (most recently, the shock of the SARS epidemic).
Positive trends are also seen in Brazil and Mexico.
But for the world's remaining two billion people, life remains desperate.
For roughly one billion people, bare survival is nothing short of precarious.
Millions die each year because they lack access to medicines, food, safe drinking water, and basic sanitation.
Their life expectancy is often less than 50 years, and is falling in many places.
The G-8 could end the suffering of the world's poorest billion people if it adopted realistic measures to solve their problems.
They fail to do so not only because they are greedy, but also because they are scared.
They think that global poverty is inevitable and too expensive to solve.
But they can solve the problems of the world's poorest--with relatively little effort and with no noticeable negative impact on their own standard of living.
The biggest problem areas are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, the Andean region, and Central Asia.
Other pockets of extreme poverty, in China and India, are on the path of amelioration due to these two giants' rapid economic growth.
But the problems in sub-Saharan Africa, the Andes, and Central Asia are not solving themselves.
These regions are trapped in poverty.
The worst situation, by far, is in Africa.
The US government believes that these countries have only themselves to blame for their poverty.
But this is the ignorant boasting of a rich country that fails to comprehend the situation on the ground.
Africa is trapped in poverty for deep-seated reasons.
It suffers from endemic malaria, which is like a SARS pandemic that lasts for centuries, not for a few months.
It suffers from a climate prone to massive droughts and from soils depleted of nutrients.
It suffers from the fact that most of its population lives in the rural interior, without paved roads to reach ports and facilitate access to international trade.
Aside from a few countries in West Africa, it suffers from a serious shortage of energy resources, whether coal or oil or hydroelectric power.
The US never had to grapple with any one of these problems in the severity that they grip Africa.
The ultimate irony is that all of these deep problems are amenable to solutions, albeit solutions that require money.
That is where the G-8 should come in.
All that is required is for the G-8 leaders to commit, at Evian, to follow through on their previous promises, which for years have remained unfulfilled.
During the past three years, the world's leaders have promised concrete action to cut global poverty by one half by the year 2015, in a series of commitments known as the Millennium Development Goals.
But only baby steps have followed.
The US increased foreign aid by perhaps $4 billion a year at the same time that it increased military spending by $150 billion annually and cut taxes by trillions of dollars.
Clearly, the US has the means to do vastly more to help the world's poor, if only it had the foresight.
Specifically, the G-8 leaders should commit to providing adequate financing for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; to raise food productivity in Africa through a new Green Revolution; to ensure that all poor children have the opportunity to go to school; and to ensure that poor people everywhere have access to clean drinking water and sanitation.
The total cost of this agenda, remarkably, would be much less than 1% of the annual income of rich countries.
For the first time in history, the rich are so rich, and the poor so poor, that a tiny effort by the rich could end massive suffering.
The Evian Summit will clarify whether greed, ignorance, and the bombast of war have closed the eyes of the US entirely, and whether Europe and Japan will look inward rather than outward.
The Case for Slowing Population Growth
Global debates about population policy are confusing.
One side argues that rising human populations threaten our environment and prosperity.
Land, water, energy, and biodiversity all seem to be under greater stress than ever, and population growth appears to be a major source of that stress.
The other side of the debate, mainly in rich countries, argues that households are now having so few children that there won't be enough to care for aging parents.
Those who fret about population growth have the better argument.
Issues confronting Europe, Japan, and to a lesser extent the United States and some middle-income countries concerning aging populations are manageable.
Moreover, the benefits of slower population growth outweigh the adjustment costs.
By contrast, if global populations continue to rise rapidly, the stresses on the world's resources will worsen.
Governments should therefore refrain from deliberate policies to raise birthrates, even in places where birth rates are low.
Part of the confusion of the public debate reflects different population trends in different parts of the world.
The fastest population growth is taking place in the poorest regions.
Poor people, especially poor people living on farms, tend to have the most children (often six or more per woman), and therefore the highest rates of population growth.
Poor farm families rely on their children for farm chores and for security when parents reach old age.
Poor families lack access to contraception and family planning.
Finally, poor families have many children as a kind of insurance policy against high child mortality rates.
As a result of high fertility rates in Africa, the UN Population Division predicts a doubling of Africa's population from around 900 million today to around 1.8 billion in 2050.
Rapidly growing populations are also young populations, because of the high number of children per household.
In Africa, the median age is now a mere 19 years and is projected to rise to around 28 years in 2050.
In Europe, the trends run in the other direction.
The UN projects a decline in population to around 630 million in 2050, from around 725 million people today.
With few children and longer life expectancy, the median age of the population rises sharply in this forecast, from 39 years in 2005 to around 48 years in 2050.
For the world as a whole, population is expected to continue to grow by another 2.5 billion people from 2005 to 2050.
All of that growth will be in the developing world: 1.3 billion more people in Asia, 900 million more in Africa, the rest in Latin America and other regions.
Adding another 2.5 billion people to the planet will put enormous strains not only on societies with rising populations, but on the entire planet.
Total energy use is soaring, reflecting the combined effect of rising per capita incomes - and thus rising per capita energy use - and population growth.
Higher energy use is already changing the world's climate in dangerous ways.
Furthermore, the strains of increased global populations, combined with income growth, are leading to rapid deforestation, depletion of fisheries, land degradation, and the loss of habitat and extinction of a vast number of animal and plant species.
Population growth in developing regions - especially Africa, India, and other parts of Asia - needs to slow.
Public policies can play an important role by extending access to family planning services to the poor, expanding social security systems, reducing child mortality through public health investments, and improving education and job opportunities for women.
A part of the European public, looking at Europe's looming population decline, wants to head in the other direction, promoting a return to larger families.
That would be a big mistake.
Advocates of faster European population growth worry that there won't be enough young workers to pay for public pensions.
But this concern can be met through increased saving by today's young and middle-aged as they prepare for retirement, and by working past the age of 65.
These workers will reap large benefits from living in societies with stable or gradually declining populations.
Most obviously, they will spend much less in direct household expenditures to raise children.
They will also save on investments in new roads, power plants, schools, and other public services.
They will enjoy less congested cities and fewer environmental pressures on the countryside.
European economies will face lower costs in limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from energy use, leading to more effective control of climate change.
The quality of life, in short, will tend to improve as Europe's population declines in coming decades.
There is nothing radical in calling for slower population growth.
For tens of thousands of years, the human population tended to rise and fall without a substantial long-term trend.
Only in the past two centuries, with the rise of modern economic life, did the world's population soar, from around one billion people in 1820 to 6.3 billion today and around 9 billion by 2050.
This explosive growth was made possible by huge advances in science and technology.
But this unprecedented growth has also put tremendous pressures on the planet.
We should intensify our efforts to slow population growth through voluntary means, and we should recognize that leveling off of the Earth's population now would add to human happiness and strengthen environmental sustainability later.
Are Foreign Investors Still Welcome?
World flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) have soared over the past two decades, from $40 billion in the early 1980's to $900 billion last year.
The cumulative stock of FDI has reached close to $10 trillion, making it the most important mechanism for delivery of goods and services to foreign markets: sales by foreign affiliates total roughly $19 trillion, compared to world exports of $11 trillion.
At the same time, the liberalization of FDI regimes by virtually all countries has been a driving force of intra-firm trade -- the lifeblood of the emerging system of integrated international production and already around one-third of world trade.
But are the good times coming to an end?
FDI can bring a range of benefits, but it also can have costs.
During the 1970's, when the transnational corporations (TNC's) undertaking such investment caught the public eye, many governments believed that the costs of FDI outweighed its benefits, so they controlled it.
Led by the developed countries, the pendulum began to swing in the 1980's.
Once viewed as part of the problem, FDI became part of the solution to economic growth and development.
Nothing exemplifies this more than changes in national FDI regimes.
As the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development reports, of the 2,156 changes that took place between 1991 and 2004, 93% were in the direction of creating a more hospitable environment for TNC's.
But there is a real danger that the pendulum is beginning to swing back, leading to a reversal of that liberalization process.
FDI in developed countries (and increasingly in emerging markets) often takes the form of cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A's).
Resistance to such M&amp;A's is becoming more frequent when they involve domestic firms that are regarded by politicians as "national champions" or important for national security, economic development, or cultural identity.
The growing involvement of private equity groups in M&amp;A activity implies additional controversy, as such transactions are typically regarded as being purely speculative.
In the name of "economic patriotism," security, and other considerations, resistance to M&amp;A's is being codified in an increasing number of countries.
For example, a United States Senate committee recently sought to block the planned liberalization of foreign takeover rules for airlines, while Europe has enacted more restrictive takeover laws.
Moreover, governments are applying more strictly existing regulatory provisions concerning the vetting of takeovers by foreign firms.
This response is intertwined with a defensive reaction to the growing role of TNC's from emerging markets, the "new kids on the block."
Established TNC's, and their home countries, will need to adjust to this new constellation of forces and its implications for the world market.
As we know from other contexts, adjustment to newcomers is not easy: compare, say, the reaction to the tie-up between France's Alcatel and America's Lucent to the bids by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation for Chevron or Mittal for Acelor.
Another type of defensive reaction -- this time to outward FDI -- may well arise once the offshoring of services gathers more speed.
All indications are that offshoring has reached the tipping point, and more of it will take place through FDI.
If home countries do not put in place the adjustment mechanisms to deal with the rapidly unfolding revolution in making service industry jobs tradable, a backlash against such outward FDI will become inevitable.
The growing unease with FDI is so far largely confined to developed countries.
But there are signs that it is spreading to emerging markets.
In the case of large-scale projects, some host countries are raising questions about the contracts that define their relationship with TNC's, and governments are reviewing such contracts because they believe (rightly or wrongly) that they did not get a fair deal.
Of the 219 known international arbitration cases concerning investment projects, some two-thirds were initiated during the past three years.
Approaches to FDI have changed in the past, and they can change again in the future, depending on how governments view the balance of costs and benefits.
This balance involves not only economic factors, but also such considerations as security and the desire to control one's own economic development.
The concept of "twenty-first-century nationalization," introduced by Peruvian presidential candidate Ollanta Humala, mirrors in this respect the "economic patriotism" of French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Reservations against FDI (as against anything foreign) can be found in all groups of countries, and politicians can bring them to the surface, resulting in protectionism.
It would be ironic, though, if developed countries -- which led the FDI liberalization wave of the past two decades -- now led a backlash against FDI.
Let us hope that the de-liberalization seen in developed countries can be checked before it spreads to other parts of the world and ultimately brings undesirable consequences for all.
Cultivating Energy
From climate change to volatile oil prices, all signs point to a looming global energy crisis.
Confronting the growing challenge means that humanity can no longer afford to ignore the inexhaustible resource found in the organic material that the sun provides each day through photosynthesis.
Solar energy enables plants to absorb carbon gas and thereby produce not only oxygen, but also matter that the animal kingdom uses for food -- and that our machines can use for energy.
Since the Neolithic (or late Stone Age) period, humans have been cultivating this "biomass" in order to feed itself.
Yet, even in today's world, its energy potential is ignored.
Beginning with the industrial revolution, humans sought energy from coal, and later from oil and natural gas, but this leads to the exhaustion of non-renewable resources.
Existing alternatives for diversifying energy production are limited.
Nuclear energy presents a number of disadvantages, owing to concerns about safety and disposal of radioactive waste.
Hydroelectric power is already widely used, while wind and solar energy are structurally sporadic and disparately available.
Biomass, on the other hand, has several advantages.
Supplies of it are large and available throughout the world.
Moreover, the technology necessary to convert it into energy -- including high-yield burning, gas conversion, and liquefaction into synthetic fuel -- has long been mastered.
Widely used during World War II, this technology has since advanced considerably.
Biomass energy, however, is the victim of unfair competition from fossil fuels.
Oil's price reflects its extraction, refining, and distribution costs, but not that of creating the raw material.
Millions of years and 200 tons of plant matter are necessary to produce one liter of oil, whereas just 15 kilograms of plant matter are required to make one liter of synthetic fuel.
After the oil glut, with oil below $20 a barrel, interest in developing energy from biomass ebbed, attractive only to "green" militants and those interested in fundamental science.
Yet the potential is immense.
The planet's biomass -- forests, pastureland, savannas, and crops -- make up productive capital that generates a 10% "return" every year.
Like a battery that runs out and is then recharged by the sun, this supply is renewable indefinitely, as long as it is managed properly.
The annual return on this capital is currently estimated at 60 billion tons, yet only two billion tons is consumed for food purposes and 10 billion tons for energy.
Increasing the responsible use of this energy source would contribute to the fight against climate change by reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and diminishing the amount of fossil fuel required to produce energy.
Moreover, its abundance in southern countries promises to facilitate their economic development.
Considered the "energy of the poor" until today, biomass could become a source of wealth if it is grown and harnessed with the support of the international community.
Thus, "energy crops" could be developed to produce biofuel.
Residue from forest, agricultural, and agro-industrial activities could be collected and converted.
For example, the six million tons of waste produced annually by Niger could theoretically be used to meet that country's entire energy needs.
However, in many places, energy cropping would certainly compete with food crops.
Long-term estimates project that over a 50-year time horizon, most of the planet's arable land would have to be used to feed the world and for forest conservation.
Thus, areas dedicated to energy production, particularly biofuel, may not reach the level that societies would wish.
But, while such competition would reveal new global scarcities, it would also bring higher prices, thereby encouraging producers to increase yields and productivity.
Thus, while cultivating energy would create new constraints, it would also open new possibilities for many economic actors.
The farmer and the forest worker could become more involved in the market, the mine engineer could begin to take an interest in crop fields, the banker in plant shares, etc.
But, in order to prepare for a scaling up of energy cropping, new policies must be implemented, both in northern and southern countries, in terms of agriculture, land and water management, protection of biodiversity, fuel taxes, and information and awareness-raising.
The ancient Egyptians and the Incas practiced a religion of the Sun, believing it to be at the beginning of all life on Earth.
Science has since proven this to be the case.
Nowadays, when it has become more important than ever that we embrace renewable resources, we should use the Sun to cultivate our energy, just as our ancestors used it to cultivate their food.
The Culture of Entrepreneurship
Governments around the world want to promote entrepreneurship.
Though most business start-ups will never amount to much, each little company is an experiment, and a great deal of experimentation is necessary to produce the occasional firm that can transform a nation's economy -- or even rise to international significance.
In short, entrepreneurship is an incubator, and one that is essential to long-term economic success.
In explaining the variation in levels of entrepreneurship across countries, much attention is devoted nowadays to differences in national attitudes and policies.
But there are also significant differences in levels of entrepreneurship within individual countries.
People from Shanghai are said to be more entrepreneurial than people in Beijing.
People in the Ukrainian town of Kherson are more entrepreneurial than people from Kiev.
In a recent study, Mariassunta Giannetti and Andrei Simonov of the Stockholm School of Economics show the magnitude of differences in levels of entrepreneurship across Swedish municipalities.
They define entrepreneurs as people who report income from a company that they control and work in at least part-time, and find that the proportion of entrepreneurs in the population differs substantially across the 289 municipalities that they studied, ranging from 1.5% to 18.5%.
What can these differences tell us about the real causes of entrepreneurship?
Policy changes at the national level cannot account for the variation Gianetti and Simonov found.
In the 1980's and early 1990's, centralized wage-setting agreements were dissolved and the Swedish government cut personal and corporate tax rates.
The level of entrepreneurial activity in the country as a whole doubled as a result, but the response was very different from one municipality to another.
Why?
Cultural variables seem to explain a lot: religion and politics accounted for about half of the variation across municipalities.
Municipalities tended to have more entrepreneurs if they had a high proportion of pensioners who were members of the Church of Sweden (the official state church until 2000) and a high proportion of right-wing voters.
Beyond that, a feedback mechanism appears to be in place: cities with more entrepreneurs tend to beget still more entrepreneurs.
Once an entrepreneurial culture takes root, it typically spreads locally, as people learn about business and begin to feel attracted by it -- even if it doesn't yield an immediate or certain payoff.
Indeed, Giannetti and Simonov discovered that the average income of entrepreneurs was lower in high-entrepreneurship municipalities than in the low-entrepreneurship ones.
Similarly, studies from other countries show that entrepreneurs often have lower initial earnings and earnings growth than they would have as employees.
What these studies suggest is that differences in the degree of entrepreneurship may be due less to better economic opportunities (the "supply" side of the entrepreneurship equation) than to cultural differences that make entrepreneurship personally more rewarding (the "demand" side).
This hypothesis is supported by Giannetti and Simonov, who argue that differences in the prestige of entrepreneurs across municipalities may account for differences in levels of entrepreneurship.
In some municipalities, entrepreneurs enjoy high social status, regardless of whether they are already successful; elsewhere they are looked down upon and other occupations are more admired.
The idea that prestige is important is not new.
In her book Money, Morals & Manners, the sociologist Michèle Lamont compared definitions of success in France and the United States.
She interviewed people in both countries and asked them what it meant to be a "worthy person."
In essence, she was asking people about their sense of what is important in life and about their own personal sense of identity.
Lamont's study confirmed the conventional wisdom that Americans value business success, while the French place greater value on culture and quality of life.
Likewise, open contempt of "money-hungry" businesspeople and competition is expressed more often in France than in America.
But, while Lamont focused on differences between the French and the Americans, her study's most interesting finding was that of significant differences between regions within France.
She compared Clermont-Ferrand, the capital of Auvergne, in the center of France, with Paris.
Auvergne's inhabitants have a reputation for being parsimonious and stern, and, despite substantial recent progress, for a relative dearth of high culture.
Lamont found that people in both Paris and Clermont-Ferrand tended to express contempt for "money-grubbing."
But the Clermontois valued "simplicity, pragmatism, hard work, and resolve," while the Parisians put more stress on "pizzazz and brilliance."
She concluded that, "In many respects the Clermontois are closer to the Hoosiers (as the residents of the US mid-Western state of Indiana are called) than to the Parisians."
Her evidence suggests that in Clermont-Ferrand, as compared to Paris, there is a higher intrinsic demand for starting small businesses.
Virtually every country is a pastiche of local cultures that differ in how they motivate people and shape their personal identity.
Differences in how these cultures define what it means to be a worthy person, and how worthiness is signaled, probably explain much of the variation in levels of entrepreneurship.
Economists and others often tend to look at countries as a whole and emphasize national attitudes and national policies as the main factors in encouraging or discouraging entrepreneurship.
But, in fact, the national success in entrepreneurship depends on the evolution of local cultures and their interaction with national policies.
Entrepreneurship can take root in culturally congenial regions of any country after economic barriers against it are lifted, and then feed on itself to grow to national significance.
Ivy League Investors
Yale University, where I teach, has entrusted its endowment portfolio to one man, David Swensen, for over 20 years.
During this period, the portfolio has grown from just over $1 billion to $18 billion -- an average return of more than 16% a year, which appears to be the highest of any major university.
And it shows no signs of diminishing: in the latest fiscal year ending in June, the return was 22.9%.
Presidents of Yale have come and gone, but Swensen stays on.
He has done more for the university than any president, or anyone else.
In a university, ideas count more than money, but $18 billion dollars can create an environment for many new ideas.
With 11,500 students, that is more than $1.5 million per student (not including the university's buildings and art collection, each worth many billions of dollars more).
How did this happen?
How did Swensen make so much money?
Everyone is wondering -- not least those of us at Yale.
After all, many people here have been teaching the "efficient markets hypothesis" that financial markets around the world have become so competitive that it is impossible to make more than a normal return from investing.
Anyone who beats the market must simply be lucky.
Studies seem to confirm this.
For example, a 2004 study by Brad Barber and Terrance Odean of the University of California and Yi-Tsung Lee and Yiu-Jane Liu at National Chengchi University acquired trade-by-trade data on individual day traders on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.
The study found that only the top 1% of day traders made a profit -- after deducting trading costs -- in two consecutive six-month periods, and the median profit was hardly worth the effort: only about US$4000.
It is easy to conclude that there is just no point in even trying to beat the market.
But then one remembers people like Swensen.
Can his consistent performance really be attributed to luck?
Robert Kiyosaki, author of the Rich Dad, Poor Dad series of popular investment books, bases his books' titles and themes on a comparison of his own highly-educated father with his friend's father, an eighth-grade dropout.
According to Kiyosaki, his poor but scholarly dad tended to be pessimistic about one's ability to achieve anything in the real world, so he discouraged his son from even trying.
By contrast, the friend's dad relished trying to achieve something big.
Is it just a coincidence that he was rich?
Kiyosaki may try too hard to be inspirational, but I often think of him when I hear finance professors opine on the efficiency of markets and the futility of making money by trading in them.
Maybe many academics find it difficult to take the initiative to achieve in the real world -- I have yet to meet another professor who has mentioned having read Kiyosaki.
But Swensen is an academic, with a Ph.D. in economics.
He is surrounded by academics.
Somehow, all this talk about efficient markets has not discouraged him from trying, and succeeding.
There seems to be a pattern.
Two similar universities, Harvard and Princeton, have had nearly the same success.
The Harvard endowment, under Jack Meyer, earned a 15.2% average annual return over the last ten years, compared to Swensen's 17.2% average, while the Princeton endowment, under Andrew Golden, earned an average of 15.6% per year.
In fact, Golden worked under Swensen at Yale from 1988 until 1993.
Swensen has written two books about investing, one for professionals and one for the general public.
I did not come away from reading them with a feeling that I know how to do what he did.
But a couple of things stand out.
One is his long-term focus.
Yale lets Swensen invest for the very long term, and does not bother him about quarterly performance.
Maybe this allows him to focus more on long-term fundamentals -- and thus to make investments that may not perform well in the short run.
But, in fact, he has done consistently well in both the short term and the long term.
Part of the reason for Swensen's success is "absolute return," a term -- now widely quoted in the investment community -- that he coined for unusual investment strategies involving such things as merger arbitrage and distressed securities.
He also has invested in non-traditional asset classes, including real estate, oil, timber, private equity, and venture capital and buyout firms.
These assets are generally not followed by multiple analysts, and are not easily understood, giving him a greater advantage in applying his intellectual skills and the skills of others around him.
In these senses, Swensen is completely different from day traders, who are both investing for the short term and trying to beat the most crowded market -- the market for exchange-listed securities.
But I also think that the phenomenal success of Swensen and others like him reflects the environment that Kiyosaki criticizes.
The problem is a defeatist attitude, not scholarship.
When an analytical mind, a mind that is trained to search rigorously for the truth and as part of a community of such people is set free from self-doubt, it can do amazing things.
Knowing David Swensen, I can attest that he is not a lonely day trader trying to beat the market.
He is a good listener, is supportive of people he trusts, and is surrounded by a lot of good people with a wide array of skills.
And he is certainly not a defeatist.
The Ethics of Eating
Global meat consumption is predicted to double by 2020.
Yet in Europe and North America, there is growing concern about the ethics of the way meat and eggs are produced.
The consumption of veal has fallen sharply since it became widely known that to produce so-called "white" -- actually pale pink -- veal, newborn calves are separated from their mothers, deliberately made anemic, denied roughage, and kept in stalls so narrow that they cannot walk or turn around.
In Europe, mad cow disease shocked many people, not only because it shattered beef's image as a safe and healthy food, but also because they learned that the disease was caused by feeding cattle the brains and nerve tissue of sheep.
People who naively believed that cows ate grass discovered that beef cattle in feed lots may be fed anything from corn to fish meal, chicken litter (complete with chicken droppings), and slaughterhouse waste.
Concern about how we treat farm animals is far from being limited to the small percentage of people who are vegetarians or even vegans -- eating no animal products at all.
Despite strong ethical arguments for vegetarianism, it is not yet a mainstream position.
More common is the view that we are justified in eating meat, as long as the animals have a decent life before they are killed.
The problem, as Jim Mason and I describe in our recent book, The Way We Eat, is that industrial agriculture denies animals even a minimally decent life.
Tens of billions of chickens produced today never go outdoors.
They are bred to have voracious appetites and gain weight as fast as possible, then reared in sheds that can hold more than 20,000 birds.
The level of ammonia in the air from their accumulated droppings stings the eye and hurts the lungs.
Slaughtered at only 45 days old, their immature bones can hardly bear the weight of their bodies.
Some collapse and, unable to reach food or water, soon die, their fate irrelevant to the economics of the enterprise as a whole.
Conditions are, if anything, even worse for laying hens crammed into wire cages so small that even if there were just one per cage, she would be unable to stretch her wings.
But there are usually at least four hens per cage, and often more.
Under such crowded conditions, the more dominant, aggressive birds are likely to peck to death the weaker hens in the cage.
To prevent this, producers sear off all birds' beaks with a hot blade.
A hen's beak is full of nerve tissue -- it is, after all, her principal means of relating to her environment -- but no anesthetic or analgesic is used to relieve the pain.
Pigs may be the most intelligent and sensitive of the animals that we commonly eat.
When foraging in a rural village, they can exercise that intelligence and explore their varied environment.
Before they give birth, sows use straw or leaves and twigs to build a comfortable and safe nest in which to nurse their litter.
But in today's factory farms, pregnant sows are kept in crates so narrow that they cannot turn around, or even walk more than a step forward or backward.
They lie on bare concrete without straw or any other form of bedding.
The piglets are taken from the sow as soon as possible, so that she can be made pregnant again, but they never leave the shed until they are taken to slaughter.
Defenders of these production methods argue that they are a regrettable but necessary response to a growing population's demand for food.
On the contrary, when we confine animals in factory farms, we have to grow food for them.
The animals burn up most of that food's energy just to breathe and keep their bodies warm, so we end up with a small fraction -- usually no more than one-third and sometimes as little as one-tenth -- of the food value that we feed them.
By contrast, cows grazing on pasture eat food that we cannot digest, which means that they add to the amount of food available to us.
It is tragic that countries like China and India, as they become more prosperous, are copying Western methods and putting animals in huge industrial farms to supply more meat and eggs for their growing middle classes.
If this continues, the result will be animal suffering on an even greater scale than now exists in the West, as well as more environmental damage and a rise in heart disease and cancers of the digestive system.
It will also be grossly inefficient.
As consumers, we have the power -- and the moral obligation -- to refuse to support farming methods that are cruel to animals and bad for us.
Fear and Freedom on the Internet
Earlier this month it was reported that, at the request of China's rulers, Microsoft shut down the Web site of a Chinese blogger that was maintained on a Microsoft service called MSN Spaces.
The blogger, Zhao Jing, had been reporting on a strike by journalists at The Beijing News that followed the dismissal of the newspaper's independent-minded editor.
Microsoft's action raises a key question: can the Internet really be a force for freedom that repressive governments cannot control as easily as newspapers, radio, and television?
Ironically, Microsoft's founder and chairman, Bill Gates, has been an enthusiastic advocate of this view.
Just last October, he said: "There's really no way to, in a broad sense, repress information today, and I think that's a wonderful advance we can all feel good about….[T]his is a medium of total openness and total freedom, and that's what makes it so special."
Despite these sentiments, Microsoft is helping the Chinese authorities to repress information as best they can.
A Microsoft spokeswoman was reported as saying that the corporation has blocked "many sites" in China, and it has been known for several months that Microsoft's blog tool in China filters words like "democracy" and "human rights" from blog titles.
Microsoft's defense is that it must "comply with local and global laws."
But the MSN Spaces sites are maintained on servers in the United States.
The relevant local laws would therefore seem to be those of the US, and Zhao Jing's discussion of the Beijing journalists' strike does not violate any of them.
Nor are there any global laws that prevent Chinese people from discussing events that their government would prefer them not to discuss.
The New York Times, for example, is free to publish its report on the strike, even though it operates a Web site that anyone with unfettered Internet access can read.
If the Chinese government does not want its citizens to read a foreign newspaper, then it is up to them to figure out how to block access to it.
The newspaper is under no obligation to do it for them.
So Microsoft's defense misfires.
We can only guess at the company's real reason for taking down the Web site, but fear of repercussions against its commercial interests in China seems likely to have been an important factor.
To be sure, a corporation can and should place limits on the use of its services.
The absolutist line -- let complete freedom of expression prevail -- crumbles in the face of uncomfortable examples.
According to Gates, Microsoft might prevent the use of its services to spread instructions about making nuclear bombs, to send pro-Nazi statements into Germany, where such material is illegal, and to propagate child pornography.
But how relevant are such examples?
In his classic defense of freedom of expression, On Liberty, John Stuart Mill argued that the most important reason for freedom of expression is to promote competition between the widest possible range of ideas, and that unfettered debate is the best way to test them.
For the government to protect ideas from criticism is to turn them into a lifeless and rigid dogma, regardless of whether they are true.
If we agree with Mill, then only one of Gates's examples falls into the category of expression that should be protected.
Recipes for making nuclear bombs are techniques, not ideas.
Nor is child pornography the expression of ideas.
We may therefore restrict both of them without running afoul of Mill's argument.
(On the other hand, an essay arguing that there is nothing wrong with adults taking a sexual interest in children, and that such conduct should be permitted, expresses ideas, and thus should not be censored, no matter how poisonous we may consider them.)
The most difficult of Gates's three examples is that of pro-Nazi statements on a Web site aimed at Germany.
It is easy to understand why Germany would wish to prohibit such statements.
Several countries' laws proscribe incitement of racial hatred, which can be justified, consistently with Mill's defense of liberty, if such laws really focus narrowly on incitement of hatred rather than on suppressing arguments, bad as they may be, that appeal to people's intellectual capacities.
A defender of suppression of Nazi ideas might argue that have already been tried, and have failed -- in the most horrendous manner imaginable -- to produce a better society.
Nevertheless, the best possible sign that Germany has overcome its Nazi past would be to focus its laws specifically on incitement to racial hatred, rather than on Nazism as such.
In any case, China's crackdown on straightforward reporting and discussion of events taking place in that country is not the suppression of a discredited political ideology, but of open and informed political debate.
If Bill Gates really believes that the Internet should be a liberating force, he should ensure that Microsoft does not do the dirty work of China's government.
The Weakness of the Strong Dollar
It is always risky to write about exchange rates.
If a currency's exchange rate is falling, it may well be rising by the time one's article appears.
But the issue of how we should think about exchange rates and their appropriate management is a perennial one.
So what is at issue now is not just the falling dollar, but rather what US officials intend to do about it.
Paul O'Neill, the outspoken US Treasury Secretary, suggests that there is little the US could or would do to sustain the dollar.
His remarks were criticized by some as abandoning the strong dollar policy that was the Clinton Administration's hallmark.
One responsibility of economic leadership is to dispel economic myths--certainly not to create them.
The "strong dollar" policy represents an especially egregious example of an economic myth; it seems to suggest that the US Treasury could, and would, maintain the strong dollar, and that a strong dollar is good for the US.
When I was chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, I was often asked if I supported the strong dollar policy.
I replied that I believed in an "equilibrium dollar."
In other words, exchange rates are no different from other prices.
Like the price of apples and oranges, market forces should determine them.
Anyone who says he believes in a "strong orange policy" would be ridiculed.
Yet some of those who seem to have the greatest faith in market forces treat exchange rates as if they were governed by laws other than those of standard economics, so that a word or even a look from a finance minister could lead currencies to soar or plummet.
Of course, there is considerable irrationality in currency markets.
Keynes once described asset markets as beauty contests, in which the objective is not to ascertain who is the most beautiful person, but whom others will think is the most beautiful.
The objective in currency markets is, indeed, often to guess what others will be thinking.
But even if government intervention can affect exchange rates in the short run, in the longer run, it is market fundamentals that matter.
There may be a legitimate role for government in limiting excessive volatility, but if underlying economic fundamentals do not drive the exchange rate, what is the basis of our confidence in the market system?
Belief in misguided notions inevitably leads to further nonsense.
On one occasion, a reporter queried the US Treasury on the adverse effects of the strong dollar on exports (at the time, car sales and other exports were suffering.)
The response was that the strong dollar meant a strong economy, and a strong economy strengthens the ability to export.
But of course, even the US Treasury, as powerful as it may be, cannot repeal the laws of economics.
Demand curves are downward sloping: typically, at higher prices, others will demand less of Americana goods, and a strong dollar means that American goods are more expensive.
Perhaps the most important objection to the strong dollar policy is that it encourages precisely this confusion between a strong dollar and a strong economy.
We should no more be emotionally attached to the exchange rate than to any other price.
A stronger exchange rate discourages exports, and when an economy is facing rising unemployment, it can make a bad situation worse.
On the other hand, a higher exchange rate may also lead to lower inflation, as import prices fall.
When inflation is the primary concern, a strong exchange rate may be good for the economy.
The strong dollar policy reeks of an economic nationalism that is out of step with the era of globalization.
If the dollar is strong, then the euro or the yen is weak.
But how are political and economic leaders in other countries to respond?
Should they simply agree to the strong dollar policy, even though it implies a weak yen or euro policy?
What is required is a debate with the US, for the strong dollar has led to an anomalous situation: the world's richest country seems unable to live within its means and must continually borrow hundreds of billions of dollars from abroad to finance its huge trade deficits.
The strong dollar--far more than Japanese protectionism--fuelled the bilateral deficit with Japan.
It also contributed to protectionism at home, reflected in the new US steel tariffs.
It is high time that the nonsense of the strong dollar policy be laid to rest.
Paul O'Neill should be commended for helping in this effort.
Perhaps we can now begin to think more seriously about creating an international economic system that acknowledges the devastating effects that market volatility among major currencies has on less developed countries, and that ensures greater stability.
For too long, we have blamed the victims.
That has merely permitted us to avoid taking a hard look at the system itself.
Is China Cheating?
Foul play!
How else, says the US, could China undercut American producers in so many areas?
For decades America seemed to dominate manufacturing, so US officials focused on liberalizing trade in manufactured goods.
They put little effort into creating a level playing field for farmers, since they knew America couldn't compete in agriculture.
Now, China is out-competing everyone, racking up huge trade surpluses with the US.
So America's Treasury Secretary accuses China of deliberately keepings its exchange rate low, and calls for China to let market forces determine the value of the reminbi.
The IMF's departing Chief Economist, Ken Rogoff, warns that the surpluses put global stability at risk.
For those who recall East Asia's crisis of five years ago, much of this seems to run counter to what was said then.
China was urged not to float its currency.
Until Argentina's peso imploded, fixed exchange rates were fine.
The US Treasury welcomed government intervention in exchange rate markets, and encouraged the IMF to support such interventions with mega-billion dollar loans to crisis countries.
If China had let its currency float back then, it would have depreciated in value, deepening the crisis.
Countries were warned: avoid trade deficits and build up reserves, because they are the key frontline defense.
East Asia's countries followed that advice, and for a good reason: they had seen the consequences of a lack of reserves.
East Asia's governments knew then that the IMF's policies would deepen their downturns, but they were helpless to resist.
The IMF had the money they needed.
China and Malaysia, lucky enough not to have to turn to the IMF or brave enough to set their own course, did what every textbook said you should do: they pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies.
China's economy continued to grow at 7%; Malaysia had the shortest and shallowest downturn.
To understand what is at stake, a few basic economic points need to be spelled out.
First, international trade is based on the principle of comparative advantage; countries export goods in which they have a relative advantage and import goods in which they have a relative disadvantage.
By and large, America now has a relative disadvantage in manufacturing, while China has a relative advantage.
China should be exporting manufactured goods to the US.
Secondly, if a country invests more than it saves, it will need to borrow, and the counterpart to that borrowing is a trade deficit.
America's burgeoning trade deficit is a result of the Bush Administration's unprecedented mismanagement.
Tax cuts that America could ill afford turned a huge fiscal surplus into a massive deficit; rather than saving, America's government is borrowing, much of it from abroad.
That, not China's exchange rate policy, is the culprit.
In fact, China's overall trade surplus today is actually small, around 1% of its GDP.
Of course, the Bush Administration wants to shift the blame, but neither China, nor anyone else, should be fooled.
This is reminiscent of what happened twenty years ago, when President Reagan engineered huge tax cuts that were supposed to pay for themselves, but which incited huge fiscal deficits, which in turn led to huge trade deficits.
Back then, Japan was blamed!
The harsh truth is that neither the IMF nor the Bush administration really believes in free markets.
They interfere with markets when it suits their purposes.
The Bush Administration supported bailouts for airlines, unprecedented subsidies for agriculture, and tariff protections for steel.
The IMF is right: there is a real risk of global instability, but the underlying cause is massive US borrowing from abroad, which began under President Reagan.
This turned the US into a huge debtor.
If, someday, America's creditors decide that they want to hold fewer dollars, it could set off large exchange rate movements, causing global instability.
Why hasn't the IMF sternly criticized these deficits?
Why should the richest country in the world live beyond its means while the IMF scolds poorer countries for smaller transgressions?
This problem is compounded by the global reserve system, which sees most countries demanding US dollars, effectively to bury them in the ground.
The system requires the reserve currency country (the US) to be a massive debtor--to the point where others lose faith.
But to solve deep-seated problems with the global financial system, we need to go beyond the complacency that has long marked the G-7 and the unilateralism that defines the current US administration.
China is right to have ignored America's demands.
Floating the exchange rate would expose the country to instabilities that would lead to a host of further problems, particularly the country's shaky banking system.
A higher exchange rate would undermine job creation and would contribute to deflation, which China is successfully combating.
China is fortunate to have the freedom to follow its own views.
Its huge foreign currency reserves give it the freedom to ignore the IMF and the US Treasury.
In the end, this may be the most compelling reason for why China should continue to run trade surpluses.
Once again, China has shown its mastery of basic economic principles.
Others in the region only wish that they could have acted similarly.
Can Italy Survive Berlusconi?
If history seems likely to rank Silvio Berlusconi as an inconsequential Prime Minister of Italy, it will surely remember him as an extraordinary -- and extraordinarily bizarre -- one.
Promising one thing and delivering another was not so much a weakness of his government as its organizing principle.
Given the erratic nature of Berlusconi's rule, it is no surprise that, ever since the 2001 election that returned him to power, the center-left l'Unione coalition has won all subsequent elections -- administrative, regional, and European.
Yet the left's prospects in the upcoming parliamentary election are far from certain, and Berlusconi seems far from doomed.
Given the country's economic conditions, one would think that Italy is ripe for decisive change.
For the last four years, average growth in incomes has been a mere 0.3%, compared to 1.5% in the European Union, and in the past two years public debt has again started to rise.
Moreover, the strategy of Berlusconi's ruling center-right Casa della Libertà coalition has been to tread water and wait for Europe's economy to pick up instead of tackling Italy's structural difficulties.
As a result, the government is criticized not only by the unions, but also by the employers' association, Confindustria, which in 2001 gave Prime Minister Berlusconi strong support.
Then there is the ongoing conflict of interests between Berlusconi-the-Premier and Berlusconi-the-magnate, who holds public licenses that make him a semi-monopolist in media and TV advertising.
During Berlusconi's tenure in office, his enormous personal assets have tripled.
While his parliamentary majority has approved many laws that promote his personal interests and have eased some of his legal difficulties, at the beginning of March, Berlusconi was again accused of corruption and tax fraud.
Berlusconi's ministers have scarcely behaved better.
Two were forced to resign within a month of each other.
Roberto Calderoli, a prominent official in Lega Nord, the third-largest government party, provoked riots in Libya by wearing a t-shirt printed with the infamous cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad.
Francesco Storace, the former Minister of Health and a leading member of Alleanza Nazionale, the second-largest government party, is suspected of organizing political espionage, in an Italian-style Watergate.
But, despite the government's catastrophic economic and ethical record, opinion polls indicate a lead of only about four percentage points for l'Unione—too small, given the high number of undecided voters, to predict the election's outcome.
So what is keeping Berlusconi and his coalition in the race?
Above all, Berlusconi's electoral campaign is aimed, in the manner of President Bush's 2004 re-election campaign, at energizing his hard-core supporters and mobilizing the growing number of voters who have abstained in recent years.
In doing this he has not hesitated to use his semi-monopoly over television to exalt his government's alleged accomplishments.
His campaign rhetoric highlights anti-communism with an emphasis not seen in Italy since 1948, coupled with a defense of the family and values cherished by the Roman Catholic establishment, although the Church has so far resisted being drawn into the campaign.
The Berlusconi coalition also benefits from the weakness of l'Unione.
Its leader, Romano Prodi, obtained an extraordinary popular endorsement when more than four million people voted for him in Italy's first-ever primary elections.
Yet Prodi continues to be a party-less leader of too many parties.
To be sure, the cohesiveness of l'Unione has strengthened: the two major parties (Democratici di Sinistra and Democrazia e Libertà - la Margherita) are united under the symbol of the olive tree, the other parties have endorsed a detailed 280-page government program, and the left-wing Partito della Rifondazione Comunista has given clear signs of moderation and loyalty to the coalition.
For voters, however, a perception of fragility remains.
Finally, the uncertainty of the outcome reflects not so much voters' behavior, but a change in the electoral system.
During the past decade, Italy has used a majority electoral system corrected by a proportional quota.
Under this system, Casa della Libertà translated a small popular majority in 2001 into a decisive parliamentary majority.
But, with the same result on the horizon this year for l'Unione, the center-right parliamentary majority changed the electoral law just a few months before the end of its term.
This is reminiscent of an army that, fearing defeat on the battlefield, poisons the wells as it retreats.
A proportional system in the absence of individual preferences means that party secretaries, rather than citizens, will choose deputies, and, with no effective electoral threshold, the number of parties will proliferate.
Although the election ballot will be 40 centimeters long to accommodate all the symbols of the old and new parties, it won't contain the name of even a single candidate.
But the worst problem is that the majority system for the Senate could lead to a different majority gaining control there than in the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house), which may well cause legislative paralysis.
Moreover, President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's mandate ends at the same time that parliament dissolves, which means that his successor, elected by the new parliament, would have to nominate a government without a majority in both houses.
Berlusconi and Prodi have ruled out a German-style grand coalition -- an outcome that seems especially unlikely following an election campaign in which both contestants have strongly hinted that their opponent has no legitimate right to govern.
At the same time, holding another vote would leave the question of the electoral law unresolved.
The puzzle of Berlusconi's survival reflects a wider European conundrum.
Many Europeans, not just Italians, are nervous and unsure of where the continent is going.
So it is no surprise that an opportunist and charlatan like Berlusconi continues to get a hearing.
Italians must decide upon the sort of Italy they want if they are to get leaders of the stature they need.
The Transatlantic Blame Game
As if the diplomatic spat over Iraq weren't bad enough, relations between America and Europe are being slowly poisoned by divergent economic policies.
Indeed, the differences between the two sides' economic strategies are as sharp as they have been in two decades.
At first glance, the depth of this ``policy gap'' seems surprising.
The economic outlook for the rest of this year and for 2004 has improved recently both in the US and Europe.
Moreover, the US and Europe face a similar challenge: encouraging economic recovery.
But their governments' actions--or lack of action--make it seem as if neither side can see the problems faced by the other.
When the Euro was introduced, most EU members--Germany, in particular--looked forward to managing their economic policies with more autonomy and less US pressure.
Thus, today's framework in Euro area, with its unique mix of joint monetary policy and national responsibility for fiscal policy, was not constructed to facilitate macroeconomic coordination with the US.
But the perception of many American observers was different.
They saw the central implication of the Euro as requiring Europe to junk its supposed role as a ``free rider'' in the international economy, one that left the US shouldering the burden of policy adjustments to promote global growth.
Europe would inevitably be forced to coordinate its policies with America.
These two views were bound to conflict, and now they do.
Tensions hidden during the long Clinton-era boom rose throughout 2001, when America tried to address its economic downturn by rapidly easing its monetary and fiscal policies.
As big budget deficits returned, so did European skepticism about the sustainability of America's mounting external deficit and the overvalued dollar.
American critics, meanwhile, saw the Euro area as overly cautious for cutting interest rates slowly and maintaining the fiscal constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Initially, the Europeans underestimated the slowdown they confronted.
Subsequently, they were constrained by the limits to their fiscal reactions embodied in the Maastricht Treaty; the large economies of Continental Europe had not done enough budgetary consolidation during the years of good growth.
Both monetary and fiscal policies facilitated growth, but Europe did not help much to redress America's external imbalance.
Of course, the Euro area is so large a player that it can no longer leave responsibility for stimulating global growth to America.
But US efforts to encourage Europeans to adopt their pragmatic and discretionary approach to economic policy inevitably lead to frustration: the issues confronting the European economies are different from those facing the US--as are perceptions about the challenges.
In fact, the main reasons for the massive swing in US public finances--from surplus in 2000 to a deficit of more than 4% in 2003-04--have little to do with stabilization.
Aside from the costs of the Iraq war and other security concerns, along with lapses in earlier spending controls, US tax cuts have structural and distributional rather than short-term aims.
A short-term stimulus would not have bestowed the largest benefits upon the most affluent, whose spending is less sensitive to taxes.
The cuts should sustain private demand this year and next, but at the cost of postponing improvements in private saving and indebtedness.
Although the dollar has been depreciating for a year, continuing growth in domestic demand will likely push the current account deficit above 5% of GDP.
As the deficit widens further, dollar depreciation will likely resume, despite laggardly performances by the world's other major economies.
Will the US accept a prolonged slowdown after 2004, and could Europe make a greater contribution to global growth?
Probably not.
The counterpart to the US emphasis on self-reliance rather than direct public assistance is that employment must be maintained at high levels--regardless of the party in power--whereas most European countries have been prepared to accept unemployment rates of 8% or more.
So the US is likely to opt for growth.
Despite three years of weak growth, the gap between potential and actual output in Continental Europe's largest economies is currently smaller than in the US.
Income tax cuts to stimulate demand for labor and investment are desirable, given high rates in Europe's largest economies.
But tax cuts that must soon be reversed--due mainly to demographic pressure on public pensions and healthcare--are unlikely to stimulate demand as consumers lose confidence in government's ability to control deficits.
Europe needs structural reforms and tighter fiscal management, not inflation.
The EU countries are finally accelerating their implementation of structural reforms, but the starting point has become less favorable and political resistance too entrenched, as illustrated by the recent conflicts over reforms of French pensions and the German labor market.
Further dollar depreciation as well as slower US growth will undermine EU exports, the one relatively successful component of demand in Europe.
The divergence in policy and its time horizon will be papered over by the improved outlook for growth in both Europe and the US for the next year or so.
But the medium-term outlook is one of transatlantic confrontation, potentially as divisive as the disputes over the Iraq war.
If so, the ongoing Doha Round of international trade negotiations could be first to suffer.
Protectionism will be harder to resist on both sides of the Atlantic.
The US cannot afford a continuing massive drain of demand through an external deficit, while complaints about loss of competitiveness will intensify in the EU.
It strains the imagination to think that the coming macroeconomic confrontation could subside quickly or quietly.
Multilateral Engagement for Energy Security
Our global need for energy reliability binds us together as surely as the global network that delivers it; a failure in one part of our network will inevitably affect everyone.
Local interests and persistent conflicts that sit astride our networks, including the as yet unresolved issue of Russian gas supply to Ukraine and Europe, have again raised the specter of energy being used as a weapon to gain political leverage.
Energy security is at the top of the agenda of the G-8 meeting hosted by President Vladimir Putin in Saint Petersburg.
The G-8 has correctly identified the key economic issue, energy interdependence, and now is the time for focused multilateral engagement on this issue.
For some countries that are blessed with vast supplies of oil and gas, the use of energy exports to reward friends and punish foes seems a tempting option.
Today, however, it is more likely to prove disruptive to friend and foe alike, as well as damaging to those countries that indulge this temptation.
Energy embargoes have generally proven counterproductive.
The price rises that followed OPEC's oil embargoes of the 1970's were unsustainable and led to conservation efforts and expansion of non-OPEC production.
As a result, OPEC's share of world oil exports dropped sharply in the twelve years following the embargo of 1973-1974.
Experience has taught us that transparency and price stability is in everyone's interest.
Pursuit of these principals while encouraging the development of global markets is essential to greater overall growth prospects for the world economy.
So when Russia sought earlier this year to quadruple the price of its gas exports to Ukraine, it argued that it was simply demanding market rates.
The message sounded fair and it did, for a short time, appeal to some policymakers and investors not fully apprised of the situation.
To be clear, measured price changes implemented over time was never in dispute; indeed, some internal price adjustments for Ukraine were in order.
Unfortunately for Russia's neighbors, it is not the market that determines what price is paid for Russia's gas or transport; it is Gazprom and its chairman, Dmitry Medvedev, who is also the Russian government's First Deputy Prime Minister.
The price charged by Gazprom for each country bordering Russia is different and is largely determined by political relationships with the Kremlin.
Economically speaking, gas supply and transport prices are more correlated to political relationships than to fundamental supply-demand or gas transport basis calculations.
Ukraine was threatened with an immediate quadrupling of its prices -- or interruption of its gas supply - as a result of it new-found independence from Russia during the Orange Revolution.
Georgia, also feeling the wrath of Moscow following the Rose Revolution, faced potentially harmful price increases as well.
Belarus, however, still in strong alignment with the Kremlin, continues to enjoy highly subsidized gas.
Of course, Ukraine was not the only country put at risk by this brinksmanship; suppliers such as Turkmenistan, geographically locked into transit requirements through Russia, also suffer.
And for the consuming nations of Western and Central Europe, the price effects and supply disruption anxieties were of significant consequence.
Immediate multilateral intervention by the European Union and the United States probably are what probably caused Gazprom to turn the gas back on.
Natural gas may be the commodity most vulnerable to event-driven supply disruptions.
The fixed interconnected pipelines lock producers and consumers in a near-exclusive embrace.
Diversification in natural gas transportations is a long-term cross-border asset development proposition requiring enormous investment and political commitment on a multilateral level.
Many solutions are already under consideration: new gas storage capacity, increased efficiency, expansion of domestic production of both oil and gas, and alternative energy supplies such as coal-bed methane.
Additionally, a market in tradable liquefied natural gas (LNG) is rapidly emerging.
It is more feasible to diversify the supply chain, albeit incrementally, by importing gas from distant producers rather than from monopolistic suppliers next door.
All of these efforts together will soften shocks somewhat and create more energy self-sufficiency.
Yet more is required.
First, G-8 leaders should consider implementing standards in energy transactions requiring open and transparent contracts in line with best practices in business.
It is important to dilute the global impact of local politicians pursuing non‑energy agendas, or simply their own limited interests.
We see these problems today in state-owned firms in Latin America, political unrest in Africa, tensions in the Middle East or through opaque business intermediaries, as in the questionable gas deal between Ukraine and Russia, known now as RUE (RosUkrEnergo).
In the end, energy security for all of us in Europe requires recognizing that the linked nature of our supply and transmission systems makes us interdependent.
This is where an "Energy Alliance" of consumers and suppliers could be useful, starting with the nations of Europe helping to guarantee the energy supplies of others in a major disruption.
The Energy Charter, which emphasizes market access and transparency, is a laudable effort but it is not sufficient for those moments of crisis; our markets are not yet well enough equipped to deal with event-driven disruptions.
The Energy Charter might be a vehicle for this collective energy security, if deepened and broadened.
It is our duty as leaders to chart a course for a secure energy future.
Tolerance of questionable dealing today for the sake of political expediency will cost more in the future for us all.
When the inevitable conflict occurs, public confidence, political credibility and market reliability are needlessly sacrificed -- this has clearly occurred for Russia and for Ukraine.
Threats to energy security must be challenged and resolved on a multilateral basis, with all stakeholders present.
The interdependent nature of our energy infrastructure requires a multilateral approach.
We are all depending on it.
Reform or Revolution in Iran?
The Lebanon Proxy
Over the past few weeks, Lebanese politicians from groups as diverse as Hezbollah and the Christian Lebanese Forces have been meeting intermittently in what has been dubbed a "National Dialogue."
Their primary objective is to forge a consensus for Lebanon's future in the wake of the withdrawal of Syrian forces last year.
But what their dialogue has exposed is how much Lebanese politics continues to be shaped by external forces.
The Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad retains huge influence over key levers of the Lebanese state, including the security and intelligence apparatus, the army, and the judiciary -- not to mention an alliance with the militarily powerful Hezbollah.
Though Syrian soldiers may have withdrawn a year ago, Assad's regime never got over its departure from Lebanon, and it seeks to re-impose some form of hegemony over the country.
Syria's stance is complicated by an ongoing United Nations investigation that accuses it of involvement in the February 14, 2005, assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri.
While Syria's Lebanese allies have called for improved ties between the two countries, the Hariri murder makes this doubtful.
For the moment, the Lebanese parties have agreed not to allow their territory to be used as a base for any presumed threats to the Syrian regime.
At the same time, Egypt and Saudi Arabia want desperately to avoid the downfall of Assad's regime.
Publicly, they support the UN's investigation, but privately they have encouraged, even pressured, the Lebanese government to lower the heat on Syria.
Lebanese adversaries of Syria have resisted such demands, but the Egyptian and Saudi stance highlights how, for reasons of self-interest, Arab regimes rarely like to see fellow despots fall.
Indeed, the Egyptian and Saudi attitude contrasts starkly with that of two Western powers with extensive influence in Lebanon, the United States and France, which support the UN inquiry wherever it might go.
Nevertheless, all four states agree that Syrian influence in Lebanon must be curbed, and all, in theory, approve of Hezbollah's disarmament -- required by UN Security Council resolution 1559 -- even if they differ over how to bring it about.
Another regional issue shaping Lebanese domestic politics is the ongoing violence between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq.
Lebanon's Sunnis and Shiites -- the country's two most powerful communities, owing mostly to their demographic weight and the backing they enjoy from elsewhere in the region -- are nowhere near the point of mutual violence, but there has been palpable political tension recently.
Hariri was the leading Sunni politician, and after his murder both communities found themselves in opposing corners with respect to Syria.
Within Lebanon, the Sunni-Shiite divide reflects broader regional frictions between the Sunni-majority Arab states, particularly Saudi Arabia, which backs Saad Hariri, the late prime minister's son, and Iran, which supports Hezbollah.
The Saudis fear that Sunni-Shiite discord, spreading from Iraq across the Arab world, might harm the kingdom, whose Shiites are concentrated in the oil-rich eastern part of the country.
That is why Riyadh has encouraged Hariri to keep lines open to Hezbollah, the leading Shiite force.
Their sectarian anxieties aside, the Saudis and Egyptians fear that a nuclear Iran might secure Shiite dominance in the region.
Grafted onto this is America-Iranian enmity, fed by the nuclear issue, but also by disagreement in Iraq.
The Arab states have found themselves uncomfortably caught in the middle, as have the Lebanese, who are alarmed that they may pay the price for any American or Israeli attack against Iran's nuclear facilities, because in either case, Hezbollah may retaliate against Israel from South Lebanon.
Inside Lebanon, Hezbollah has interpreted UN demands for its disarmament as a plot by the Bush administration to weaken the party, and as a means of affirming American supremacy in the region.
Hezbollah has refused to disarm in the face of what it has called the Israeli threat, although its definition of this threat has shifted frequently enough to cast doubt on whether it would ever be willing to surrender its weapons.
More recently, Hezbollah agreed to place the issue on the domestic negotiating agenda -- perhaps because Iran doesn't want it to be a source of national dissension -- but it is doubtful that genuine disarmament will ensue, at least for now.
Finally, as they maneuver around the shoals of regional and international affairs, the Lebanese must also consider domestic American politics.
Whatever one thinks about the war in Iraq, the US presence there has helped Lebanon to ward off Syrian efforts to reverse its withdrawal, as well as Arab efforts to compel the Lebanese to compromise with a regime that loathes Lebanese sovereignty.
A US administration in full withdrawal from Iraq would likely become indifferent to what happens in Lebanon.
Who but Syria and Iran would benefit from that?
Such an outcome might satisfy some parts of Lebanese society, particularly Hezbollah.
But most Lebanese remain committed to seeing their country living in peace, free from the isolation and militancy that are the hallmarks of Iran and Syria.
Unfortunately, Lebanon has always been buffeted by its surroundings, and the country could once again become an arena for destructive regional conflicts, regardless of what the Lebanese prefer.
Prague Stock Market falls to minus by the end of the trading day 
After a sharp drop in the morning, the Prague Stock Market corrected its losses. 
Transactions with stocks from the Czech Energy Enterprise (ČEZ) reached nearly half of the regular daily trading. 
The Prague Stock Market immediately continued its fall from Monday at the beginning of Tuesday's trading, when it dropped by nearly six percent. 
This time the fall in stocks on Wall Street is responsible for the drop. 
The reaction of the market to the results of the vote in the American House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan for the stabilization of the financial sector there, has manifested itself here as well. 
Stocks fall in Asia 
Stocks in the Asian markets experienced a dramatic drop on Tuesday, even though the indexes ultimately erased a part of the losses during the day. 
The Hang Seng Index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange wrote off nearly four percent during the day, but later it erased a part of the losses and reduced the decrease to roughly 2.5 percent. 
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which follows the movement of Chinese stocks on the stock market in Hong Kong, dropped by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed. 
Stocks on the market in Sydney lost more than five percent, but ultimately lowered their losses to 4.3 percent. 
The stock exchange in Taiwan dropped by 3.6 percent according to the local index. 
"The timing of the bailout action in the USA is uncertain and it will influence financial markets all over the world," remarked the head of the Hong Kong Currency Board, Joseph Yam. 
Despite the fact that it is a part of China, Hong Kong determines its currency policy separately, that is, without being dependent on the Chinese Central Bank. 
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States. 
American legislators should quickly return to their negotiations and approve the bill to support the financial system, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. 
Otherwise there reputedly looms the threat that other countries will also feel the impacts. 
American stock bloodbath 
On Monday the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, into which up to 700 billion dollars (nearly 12 billion Czech crowns) was to be invested. 
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's appeal for them to support the plan. 
According to Bush, the plan would tackle the basic causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy. 
American stocks suffered a bloodbath on Monday and the major stock indexes registered their greatest fall in more than 20 years. 
The Dow Jones Index dropped by nearly seven percent, having registered a similarly-ranged fall the last time in 1987. 
The index had dropped even prior to the vote, but as soon as it was revealed that the bill had not passed in the House, the index went into free fall. 
Congress yields: US government can pump 700 billion dollars into banks 
The top representatives of the American Congress and George W. Bush's cabinet have agreed upon a broader form of the agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system. 
The vote on it will take place at the beginning of next week. 
American legislators made a breakthrough in their talks about the approval of a bailout plan in the form of financial assistance for the American financial system amounting to 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 billion crowns). 
But all is not won yet. 
That is, the members of congress have to complete some details of the agreement before they can make the final version of the law public and vote on it. 
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday. 
The chair of the Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, told Reuters this on Sunday. 
Sources say that the senate could evidently vote on the plan on Wednesday at the soonest. 
Economists say that the announcement that the bailout plan will be approved should be the first psychological factor significant to the revival of financial markets. 
Afterward, however, a "sobering up" will take place due to the complicated nature of the mechanisms with which assistance to the markets can be achieved in practice. 
Paulson: Plan must be effective 
"We've made great progress. 
We've resolved our differing opinions on how the package for the stabilization of markets should look," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg. 
According to her, the final vote could take place as early as Sunday. 
Representatives of the legislators met with American Finance Minister Henry Paulson Saturday night in order to give the government fund a final form. 
The fund is meant to purchase unsellable mortgage assets which are pulling financial companies down into heavy losses and are endangering the stability of the entire system. 
"We're on the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan which will function and which also must be effective on the market. 
It's necessary to continue in the curative plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said. 
A signal for Asian trading 
The global financial crisis is significantly impacting the stock markets, which are dropping sharply. 
According to Nevada Democratic senator Harry Reid, that is how that legislators are trying to have Congress to reach a definitive agreement as early as on Sunday. 
Namely, by doing this they want to calm investors prior to trading on the Asian financial markets, which, given their time zones, are the first ones where the decision by Congress could influence Monday's trading. 
In the meantime, however, it is not yet clear with any certainty when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the bill, nor whether the negotiations will not become hindered by some problem. 
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days. 
However, the bill will still go through a series of changes. 
The total amount designated for assistance to the system is to be divided into two parts. 
The initial 350 billion dollars is to become available as soon as possible, as requested by president George Bush. 
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount, in the sequence of a further 100 billion dollars and later, the final 350 billion dollars, if it has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function. 
Bush appreciates progress in negotiations 
Though the president can veto this decision, Congress can override his veto. 
Even in spite of these changes, the essential idea of the program, to gain finances for the buyout of bad mortgage stocks, the value of which had dropped because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay off their mortgages, has remained intact. 
"We've drawn it all up. 
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican senator Judd Gregg. 
Even American president Bush is satisfied with the progress in negotiations. 
His speaker Tony Fratto declared that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciated the "two-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and save our economy". 
Constraining golden parachutes 
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said that the legislators had agreed upon the responsibilities for the financial program, protection of the taxpayers against losses, closing of relief packages, and timing of the financial plan. 
The new law is also meant to constrain the "golden parachutes" for the heads of the companies participating in the program and establishes a committee which will oversee the fund. 
The committee is to be directed by the Ministry of Finance. 
"We've worked very hard on this and we've made great progress toward an agreement that will work and that will be useful for all Americans," Paulson said. 
The plan also includes assistance to homeowners who have problems making their payments. 
The cabinet should negotiate new payments for the mortgages it buys, with the aim of lowering the monthly payment costs for those in debt and enabling them to keep their houses. 
Marek: Psychological help 
According to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its realization will be very difficult. 
"And this is because it is not known through what mechanism and for what price the problematic assets will be bought. 
This will determine how the financial sector and the cabinet will divide the losses amongst themselves," Marek told the server iHNed.cz this week. 
Whether the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week is not so significant, according to Marek. 
"More important is for the members of congress to agree this week to support the plan and to approve it as soon as possible. 
The psychological significance of the agreement that the approval will take place is the most important thing at this time," Marek emphasized. 
Razor's edge battle: MP3 players vs. cell phones. 
Our advice on how to choose 
While nearly every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls. 
This makes it seem clear that it is better to only buy a phone. 
In spite of this, there are many reasons to get a separate MP3 player. 
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and demands of the future owner. 
It is not likely that you will get a top-of-the-line expensive record player in order to listen to the newest album by Maxim Turbulenc. 
First of all such music products not available on LPs, but also, from the qualitative point of view there no objective reason for it. 
However, if your shelves are crowded with art rock, jazz, or blues vinyl records, you are likely at least dreaming of a record player like that. 
It's the same with music on trips, that is, compressed music, simply put, MP3 music. 
There are price and qualitative categories here as well. 
For some, it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on an MP3 player, just as it is hard for Pink Floyd fan to accept twenty-crown headphones from a market hall. 
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone. 
The selection is broad. 
Battery life also decides 
Some top-of-the-line music players can do much more than merely play music, but also what most cell phones can't even do by chance. 
No contemporary machine is as universal as the telephone. 
In addition to the primary functions, calling and texting, it can play music and video, record both, contains a camera which is sometimes better and sometimes worse and can even navigate in some cases. 
And when we take smart phones and communication devices, you have a small computer in your pocket. 
It's a small miracle, as there is no refrigerator that knows how to grill and no television can take pictures. 
The universal nature of the cell phone also brings disadvantages. 
The more functions you use on your cell phone, the sooner the indicator on your display will send you running for the charger. 
And playing music is one of the biggest energy guzzlers. 
Very few cell phones can play music for longer than ten to twelve hours, most of them much less. 
In this way, music players (particularly the simplest ones) are much more efficient. 
Which is why you should count on the fact that inexpensive cell phones will not play for more than a few hours. 
If you occasionally make calls in addition to that, to be on the safe side, get another charger for your workplace - even for more expensive devices. 
You won't have this problem with MP3 players, even worse ones last at least 9 straight hours running on one charge. 
Another problem arises when recording music on the cell phone. 
Unfortunately, only a limited percentage of the devices contain a universal USB connector, and on top of that, not every one of those can be directly connected to a computer without special software. 
Of course, music can be recorded directly onto a memory card, but very few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards used in the cell phones without an adaptor. 
For the music players, with some exceptions (iPod), you don't need any special software. 
It's enough to fill the device with music using the USB from the computer. 
Most cell phones and music players already create a music library by themselves, organized according to the artist's name, album title, genre, or, e.g., user rating. 
Some devices only display the tree structure of the directory, similar to Windows Explorer and some are able to do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with an operating systems). 
Music players easier to service, cell phones can do more 
In choosing specific equipment, you should be interested above all in the life of the battery, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of the audio output, and of course also the user-friendly nature of the operation. 
If music is above all a background setting for you and if you are only going to listen to it for a little while, perhaps in the tram, any cell phone which plays MP3 is enough. 
Which almost any cell phone is truly able to do. 
You don't even have to pay too much attention to which music formats the cell phone or music player can handle. 
The MP3 can handle all of them, and in fact, most of the music you will get will be in this very format. 
It one of the most widespread formats and in addition to it, the absolute majority of devices can also handle music in WMA format. 
Less common is the appearance of AAC (the format used by the Apple company and its iPods). 
Better cell phones, at the same time, enable the purchase of music on-line. 
All you have to do to buy a song or album is visit the pages of the given operator (or another provider) using mobile Internet. 
This service by itself could be a substantial reason for obtaining a music cell phone. 
Unfortunately the offerings from the operators are paltry and are usually limited to fast-growing radio hits. 
The prices are also not among the lowest. 
It is generally assumed, however, that this very manner of music sales (whether using GSM, the Internet or wireless Internet) will take over the music industry in the future. 
Most people have their cell phone on them at all times. 
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you can reach for your cell phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player lies at home, forgotten. 
However, it still depends on whether you always have headphones or at least the wire hands-free with you. 
If not, you can utilize the integrated speaker that is in almost all cell phones, but only in a minimum of MP3 players. 
But the greatest advantage of the music cell phones for many people is the price. 
The least expensive of them regularly cost less than three thousand crowns. 
For three or four thousand crowns, you can get a very decent walkman. 
Usually, however, you'll be limited by the absence of output on ordinary headphones. 
The best and most technically well-equipped telephones, with a 3.5 mm jack for ordinary headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand crowns. 
The advantage of the music players, on the other hand, is, among other reasons, that they are easy to operate. 
Anyone can handle the operation of the simplest - not necessarily the most inexpensive (see our selection) - music players. 
The minimum of functions and similarity in operation to the formerly common cassette recorder or even the record player is apparent. 
There is no threat of a clash in the form of mobile Internet turned on by accident and the resulting enormous bill for data transmission. 
What device to reach for 
Even the least expensive cell phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) generally have a slot for replaceable memory cards (of the type M2, microSD and the like). 
Even with the additional purchase of the respective card, you will spend less than two thousand crowns. 
Be careful, however. 
With the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB tend to be supported. 
Only the most expensive ones can also handle 8 GB memory cards. 
If you already have a cell phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. 
Based on capacity (maximum 2 GB) you don't have to spend more than 1,100 crowns. 
If you are a more demanding listener, reach instead for specialized cell phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung models). 
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the user-friendly nature of their operation is close to that of a separate MP3 player. 
Sony Ericsson, whose cell phones from the walkman series have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately, is the most advanced in the field. 
The MP3 players from the brands mentioned above deliver the same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery endurance (normally 15 hours, maximally up to 35 hours). 
First virtual operator to arrive in Czechia this year. 
Maybe 
The mobile market in Czechia is quite advanced and local operators offer practically all the same services as their partners in Western Europe. 
In spite of this, there is something missing here - a virtual operator who would force the classic operators to lower their prices. 
It might be missing for a long time. 
We have already written many times on Mobil.cz about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe. 
This has also been confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Bureau, who called attention to the fact that the price of a text message is higher here than in the rest of the Union. 
Following the most recent steps taken by the European Commission in the field of regulation of the roaming fees, a paradoxical situation may occur - text messages for some customers of Czech mobile operators will be cheaper from abroad than at home. 
How is it possible that the prices in Czechia remain so high in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competitors who would really like to enter into battle. 
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, after all, we have three mobile networks here and over 100% coverage. 
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to pretend that the Czech market is extremely competitive. 
This is often seconded by the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Bureau (CTB) Pavel Dvořák, who in the past has claimed several times that there is no room for another operator in Czechia. 
It is probably true that a classical operator with its own network no longer has much chance (for that matter, it would be very difficult to find frequencies). 
But there is one more opportunity - a virtual operator. 
It is precisely the entrance of the virtual operators on the mobile market that brought the significant lowering of prices, to which even the classic operators had to react. 
At the same time, even before the entrance on the market of aggressive competitors such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, voices similar to those here could be heard. 
But it has turned out that there is a place for such operators and they can be truly successful. 
For that matter, we don't have to go far to find examples. 
In February of this year, we informed you of the start of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland. 
Over the course of merely half a year, this operator was able to gain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator. 
At the same time, the financial group Penta, which owns, among others, U:fon, stands behind Mobilking. 
The advantage of the virtual operators is the opportunity to concentrate on a much more specific target group. 
In order to function effectively, they require many fewer customers than a classic operator does. 
That is, they do not carry the relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network. 
In this way, virtual operators around the world usually profile themselves as low-cost - they offer inexpensive calling and text messages, which is often balanced out by a more limited offer of services, though. 
That's how, for example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain can offer text messaging for at least fifty percent less than its competitors. 
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a rather good move and a bet on a novel target group. 
That is, this operator is specifically oriented toward men. 
"Real men choose Mobilking - the operator that they like and can trust," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which runs this virtual operator. 
It is hard to say if a concept similar to the one in Poland could catch on here. 
Miroslav Čepický, spokesman for Vodafone, doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segmented approach on which most virtual operators are founded. 
In addition, it's relatively saturated from the perspective of the offer of services." 
No chance in Czechia, say mobile operators 
It seems almost certain that if there is to be a virtual operator in Czechia, it won't be Mobilking. 
"We have been talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in Czechia don't look very hopeful. 
More likely, Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our region," said Jana Studničková, speaker for the Penta financial group, in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz. 
She also confirmed indirectly that the current mobile operators in Czechia are definitely not inclined toward this idea. 
Rather, on the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can so that no potential competitor comes into existence. 
For a longer period of time now, the GTS Novera group has made no secret of its interest in launching a virtual mobile operator, and in this way it would like to take another step in the direction of becoming a real competitor of Telefonica O2 in the area of corporate clientele. 
"We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only hardwire telecommunication services, but also mobile ones. 
The sooner, the better. 
We have held repeated negotiations on this possibility with all Czech mobile operators. 
We have already been able to make progress in the negotiations with some of them," said the group's spokesman, Pavel Kaidl. 
Perhaps there are better times ahead. 
On the basis of unofficial information, it looks like we can expect the first virtual operator as early as the end of this year. 
In the meantime, however, its creation is accompanied by a wall of silence. 
"At this time, we do not think that there is space for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator. 
Compared to other markets, the Czech market is very specific. 
No subject has approached us thus far with a complex and serious project in this area," claimed Vlastimil Sršeň from the public relations department of Telefonica 02 in a statement for Mobil.cz. 
Other operators also refer to the specific nature of the Czech market. 
In a rare shared opinion with a statement by O2, T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová added: "We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous business project that it would be possible to build upon." 
And she added: "No virtual operator is likely to appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year. 
At this moment, in order to be talking about such a short timeframe, we would already have to have a concrete agreement on the table." 
Vodafone is placing its attention more upon fulfilling the requirements of its own 3G license. 
Regarding this, Miroslav Čepický said: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, above all in the area of shared costs and infrastructure. 
From the perspective of the customers, we consider this to be the most beneficial. 
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner for the construction of a shared network for fast mobile Internet." 
Responsible authorities - buddy-buddy with operators 
The procedure of the mobile operators is easy to understand, the entrance of another operator would mean increased competition, it would lead to a decrease in prices and hence to a decrease in their profits. 
Why, then, make this entrance easy for such a competitor? 
The tug-of-war surrounding the creation of U:fon attests to the fact that when something is important to the operators, they are able to pull for the same team. 
Probably the greatest pressure on the Czech Telecommunication Office was during the time of the creation of U:fon by T-Mobile. 
Information publicly available from the Czech Telecommunication Office's web pages attests to this. 
But now this is a suitable argument for U:fon to not allow the entrance of the virtual operator. 
Regarding that matter, Martina Kemrová pointed out: "The competitive environment of the mobile market was also recently amplified by the entrance of the fourth mobile operator onto the market. 
Considering the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is evident that the entrance of another player would place higher demands on it and above all on its services." 
But considering this approach by the mobile operators, the lack of interest by the Czech regulatory organs is, in fact, startling. 
This means not only the attitude of the CTO, which unfortunately in Czechia - unlike in Great Britain and other developed countries - does not have the authority to intervene in economic competition. 
This authority belongs to the Office for the Protection of Competition (OPC) exclusively. 
But this office has assumed its typical position on this whole issue. 
"The entrance of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible after the signing of a contract on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator. 
No such contract has ever been signed, because the supply of potential interested parties was most likely not sufficiently interesting for classic operators," claimed Kristián Chalupa from the external relations department of the OPC in his answer to our question. 
A statement formulated in that way by representatives of the operators probably won't surprise anyone. 
From the office that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, make sure that no one abuses his/her position on the market, it is more than serious. 
All the more so when Kristián Chalupa added: "In other countries, where virtual operators commonly function, we can observe that their entrance on the market contributed to the decrease in the prices of mobile telephone services." 
But evidently the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the decrease in prices are not among the interests of the OPC. 
In truth, the shocking element of the whole case is the almost fluid harmony between the three mobile operators that is implicit in their reactions. 
The question as to whether this is really just a coincidence arises entirely by itself. 
Just like the exact same price of gasoline at the gas stations is surely just the product of coincidence and the tough competitive battle. 
"The Office did not find any signs of actions violating the rules of competition, and thus has no reason to intervene in any way. 
None of the operators have a dominant position, and hence none of them have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market. 
The telecommunications regulator is most likely also lacking the instruments necessary to open the mobile market for the virtual operators," Chalupa claimed in his statement. 
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the disputed points. 
Of course, an analysis of the relevant markets does exist, conducted by CTO, according to which telecommunications are, from the perspective of competition, the only market. 
On such a market, none of the Czech operators then have a dominant position. 
But some legal experts offer a different perspective - in order to create a virtual operator, it is always necessary to gain the permission of the network operator. 
And the mobile operator - entirely logically - has a monopoly on its network. 
So in a certain segment, it must necessarily be dominant. 
But even if we did not consider this argument, for the OPC it could be at least alarming that the three mobile operators are proceeding in a strikingly similar manner. 
At the same time, complaints from a series of interested parties (including the GTS Novera company mentioned above) demonstrate that they are encountering very similar hurdles in their negotiations with all the operators. 
Placing the responsibility on the CTO is a rather common trick in telecommunications, through which the OPC can have nothing to do with the whole matter. 
We have already encountered it in several similar cases. 
Unfortunately, it was not possible to establish the extension of the CTO's authority to the area of competition in telecommunications in the recently approved amendment to the Telecommunications Act, even though many experts had expected that this would improve the situation. 
The representatives of the OPC must know this very well, but their interests are evidently elsewhere. 
It can be done when nobody's looking 
At the same time, the functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are already several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed. 
These are companies which publish their own price lists for mobile telephone services, which are only partially public. 
These are usually companies dealing with multilevel marketing. 
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile telephone services. 
The price lists of these companies usually only reach selected individuals. 
The trick lies in the fact that, in relation to the operator, the company acts like a classic company client who orders a great amount of SIM cards. 
As a significant client, it then gets special price offers (and other types of offers). 
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such advance sales. 
"If the cases you are talking about were to occur, this could be a violation of the contract conditions, which we would investigate, and it could culminate in the termination of our cooperation with the given company," Martina Kemrová answered our question on this problem. 
But it is highly unlikely that activities like this would not be reported to the responsible people from the mobile operators. 
This could be a question of thousands of customers, above all in the case of the three companies mentioned above. 
But at the same time, none of the operators are opposed to such a procedure. 
Namely, they make considerable profits from the activities of these companies and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they do not present any sort of threat to them through their own official marketing. 
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to potential problems: "The law enables such speculation, nevertheless only an insignificant percentage of customers use the services of these companies. 
On top of that, they must accept that the SIM card in their telephone is not registered under their name, and thus they cannot use all of its features like the regular customers of the mobile operators can." 
This is precisely what should seem at least strange to the CTO. 
In addition, another question for the OPC arises. 
If the mobile operators are looking the other way concerning this procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator? 
It must be added that the OPC has rather considerable power to uncover such activities, and if it does not wish to, it does not have to be satisfied with operators' claims that they have no idea about any such thing and that their trading conditions prohibit it. 
When we won't be the most expensive 
As mentioned already several times in this article, the entrance of the virtual operators onto the mobile market was brought about by a notable drop in the prices of services. 
At the same time, classical operators have more or less tried to prevent the creation of virtual operators practically in all countries where they have been created. 
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too small, too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc. 
But in developed countries, the regulatory organs, which supported the interests not of the mobile operators, but of their customers, intervened at that very moment. 
Either through formal measures or informal pressure, they then achieved the creation of the first virtual operator, and others continued in its footsteps. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory organs have been tossing the whole case back and forth like a hot potato. 
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that the lack of clarity in competencies in these cases suits them very well. 
But let's not throw in the towel. 
If the behind-the-scenes information are correct and a virtual operator appears here soon, the Czech mobile market might be set in motion once again. 
If one of the operators permits the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for OPC to be able to remain indifferent to the refusal (discrimination) of further interested parties. 
And we might stop making calls that are more expensive than in the rest of Europe. 
New Czech national anthem has four new versions. 
Choose the best one 
Listen to the four renderings of the new version of the Czech national anthem. 
On Sunday Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my Country) on the occasion of the Day of Czech Statehood. 
The anthem was newly recorded by the National Theater Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek. 
Four versions are available - versions with male or female solo vocals, a choral version and an instrumental version. 
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka did the singing. 
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček. 
You can listen to all four versions on the server iHNed.cz. 
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful national anthems. 
He told Czech Radio earlier that he had intentionally selected singers with young, representative voices that were striking and popular for the solo variants. 
"From the beginning, with both of them and also with the chorus, I tried to make sure that they had clear articulation, so that the text could be understood well, so that they were in harmony," he said. 
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year. 
The song Kde domov můj (Where is my Country) was heard for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Estates Theater in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl with the music of František Škroup. 
It gained popularity and the people spontaneously took it as their own. 
The first stanza of the song then became a natural part of the national anthem following the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918. 
It remained one of the seven state symbols even following the creation of the independent Czech Republic. 
How the "new" hymn sounds 
Prague City Mass Transport to operate on chip for the first time on Wednesday 
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written into the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first travellers board the metro, trams and buses with an electronic coupon in their pockets instead of a paper ticket. 
The roughly one hundred thousand people in possession of their own chip card Opencard at this time can get this coupon. 
Travellers can buy a 30-day, 90-day and year-long coupon (which will be valid beginning on January 1, 2009) and at the same time have it added to their chip card at info centers and branches of the Transport Company at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka. 
Beginning yesterday, coupons can also be purchased over the Internet on the web pages of the Transport Company, www.dpp.cz. 
By the afternoon, more than four hundred customers had used the service. 
Those beginning to use Internet shopping can definitively forget about the vending windows in the metro stations, where up to now they have had to regularly stand in long lines for paper tickets. 
That is, they can buy the coupon over the Internet and it will be added to the Opencard at one of the thirteen branches of the City Library. 
"At these locations, there is a counter available for travellers with trained staff who will help interested people with their Internet purchase, and will also add the purchased coupon to their card," said the project's speaker, Martin Opatrný. 
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to add the electronic coupons to the Opencard at the self-service machines which have been set up in several vestibules of the metro. 
What do these self-service machines look like? 
They are red, resembling ticket validation machines, and travellers might have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská. 
"Now there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty of them," Opatrný added. 
Coupon checked by self-service machine instead of driver 
Using the self-service machines, which will begin functioning tomorrow, is simple. 
All you have to do is insert the Opencard chip card, and the pre-paid card is automatically added to it. 
The electronic coupons are valid beginning tomorrow not only in the capital city, but in its surroundings as well. 
That is, in suburban trains and bus lines numbered 300 to 499, which are mainly used by inhabitants of Central Bohemian towns to travel into the capital city. 
"In trains included in Prague Integrated Transport, the conductors are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they can check the time and zone validity of the coupons," Filip Drápal from the organization Ropid, which creates the timetables of the Prague Mass Transport, explained the ticket-checking procedures. 
The suburban buses have card readers built into the cash register next to the driver's seat. 
Upon boarding, it is thus necessary to not only show the chip card to the driver, but in addition it is necessary to place the Opencard on the designated spot on the side of the cash register. 
This is how the driver checks the validity of the coupons recorded. 
"If the traveller needs to confirm the validity of the coupons recorded, there is nothing easier than requesting this information from the driver," Drápal added. 
Travelers who do not use suburban buses, and will not remember when the validity of a coupon ends, can head again for the self-service machines where the coupons are added to the card. 
Here the information on the validity of their documents will appear on the machine's screen. 
Sudetenlands wanted referendum from USA 
Sudeten Germans requested that the Šumava region be incorporated into the United States in 1945. 
This is implicit in a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemia Research Library. 
If we cannot be a part of Germany or Austria, we wish at least to live under the patronage of the United States. 
Several groups of Sudeten Germans supposedly addressed the president of the USA with a wish of this type. 
This arises from, among other things, a letter which has been preserved in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemia Research Library. 
In the letter, Germans from Český Krumlov request that the American president not to allow the return of the "Šumava region" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia. 
"We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be truly certain of the words that the American troops are entering German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but rather, as liberators," is what is written in the letter, signed "People who are not indifferent to the fate of Šumava". 
Since the annexation by Czechoslovakia supposedly only gives the Sudeten Germans hope for - knowing the Czech national character - brutality, disregard, lack of understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protectorate of Šumava forever. 
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would award this territory to a state foreign to us, which oppresses and oppugns minorities and which has contributed nothing, absolutely nothing, to the victory of the Allies," is written in the letter. 
The reason why the authors could not sign their names was the supposed fear of revenge by the "Czech oppressors". 
If the president of the USA were to supposedly have doubts about the persuasion of the Šumava Germans, it would be enough to organize a referendum in the Šumava region on whether its inhabitants want to become a part of the USA or live under the patronage of the United States. 
Though the text of the letter may sound a bit naïve given the contemporary knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately sketches the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time. 
Even though the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that their displacement from the country would be discussed, almost none of them admitted this possibility at all. 
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate a certain type of autonomy for the Sudetenlands. 
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia. 
The famous journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, also confirms this. 
As a German from České Budějovice, he was sent to the navy in the Baltic Sea during the war. 
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Holstein, tens of other Czech Germans went to him so that he would teach them Czech. 
"They believed that when they returned home, Czech would come in handy," Chalupa said. 
According to him, none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war envisaged being displaced from the republic on the basis of the Beneš Decrees. 
You don't think - you pay! 
Emotive campaign attacks drivers 
The most expensive action aimed at safety on the roads in Czech history. 
That's also one way to characterize the emotive media campaign which the Ministry of Transportation plans to launch on Wednesday. 
The office of minister Aleš Řebíček hopes that it will discourage drivers from behaving dangerously behind the wheel. 
The 150-million-crown campaign will appear on television, on the radio, in cinemas, on the Internet, but also on flyers. 
It should discourage drivers from speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol. 
And also remind them to fasten their seatbelts before they start driving. 
Above all, it aims to reach into the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians, and last but not least, professional drivers. 
And what appears in the spots? 
Mainly human stories that attack the emotions. 
And even the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign attests to this: 
You don't think - you pay! 
The words "you don't think" are written in capital letters on a license plate. 
And then the words "you pay" are in a pool of blood. 
This is meant to symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of carelessness with his/her own life. 
The spots will "haunt" the viewers until 2010. 
The ministry found inspiration in similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where it is common to find pictures with drastic images of accident victims. 
It hopes that the accident rate and the number of deaths on the Czech roads will thus decrease. 
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG. 
Sugar and whip for drivers 
"The drivers are influenced by the sugar and whip system. 
The sugar for them is, for example, when they run a red light, they save time. 
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident. 
The drivers must be repeatedly reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, a transportation psychologist from Na Homolce Hospital. 
And that's why information campaigns in the press and mainly negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist believes. 
Less effective in his opinion are the tables which draw the drivers' attention to the danger. 
"If a static table which warns against danger is installed, it will likely soon blend in with the surroundings and the drivers will not pay attention to it," Kořán warned. 
Olmert would return nearly all occupied territories in exchange for peace 
The prime minister of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, expressed his opinion in favour of the restitution of practically all territories occupied in 1967, that is, even Transjordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and with Syria. 
He did this in an interview which was printed by the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth on Monday. 
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return nearly all of the (occupied) territories, if not all of them," Olmert told the newspaper. 
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to cede a similar percentage (of Israeli territory) to the Palestinians, because there will be no peace if we don't do that," he added. 
He admitted that the possible restitution would also include East Jerusalem. 
"Whoever wants to be safe in Jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozers to run over his or her legs, like what happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in reference to two attacks in the city in July, during which several people were killed and tens injured. 
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Temple Mount, a sacred and historic place", which lies inside the Old City. 
"Whoever will want to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs. 
That won't work," he stressed further. 
Leaving Golan Heights 
Olmert also expressed his opinion in favour of the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which according to him is an essential condition for entering into a peace agreement with Syria. 
But that would also require certain effort from Damascus. 
"I am not proposing to agree on peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan Heights," he warned. 
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up in order to gain the Golan Heights. 
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship to the (Shi-ite movement) Hezbollah; they will have to give up the ongoing support they provide to the terrorism of the (Shi-ite movement) Hamas, (the terrorist network) Al-Qaeda and the jihad (holy war) in Iraq," the prime minister specified. 
Questions after accident: Are stewards in the bus illegal? 
Law doesn't know them, walking in coach bus not permitted 
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the company Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question has arisen as to whether stewards and passengers can move around the bus while it is in motion. 
"If we would like to strictly and formally uphold the law, the activities of the steward are in conflict with the Traffic Law," says speaker for the Ministry of Transportation Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, during which a twenty-two-year-old stewardess died last week, was evidently caused by the driver of the truck that crossed into the path of the bus. 
Unluckily, at that moment, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the vehicle, even though there are two more seats reserved for her. 
However, the bus can crash or brake sharply even when the steward is handing out coffee or newspapers. 
The question of whether the bus is equipped with standing room in accordance with its registration plays a role. 
If this is not approved in the bus, the passengers must sit. 
The Student Agency coach buses do not have standing room; which the head of the company, Radim Jančura, also confirmed for Aktuálně.cz. 
"We tried to find a solution to this with the ministry, and initially they did not permit the movement of the passengers. 
Eventually they revoked this and we reached the conclusion that the passengers are allowed to go to the toilet if they have their own seat," he conveyed his position. 
The law does not know the steward 
"There is no straightforward legal interpretation of the steward - no legal enactments deal with this role. 
However, nor do any legal enactments prohibit the transporters from providing services. 
The Traffic Law only knows the term vehicle conductor; it does not define the rights and responsibilities of that person," speaker Hanzelka added less unambiguously. 
The head of the Department of Motor Vehicle Operation of the Ministry of Transportation, Josef Pokorný, on the contrary, said that the law treats this issue sufficiently. 
"It depends on whether the bus has standing room permitted in its certification. 
That's all there is to it," he says. 
Buses are divided into the categories of city bus, where there is standing room and limited maximum speed, inter-city buses with standing room and a higher maximum speed permitted, and coach buses, with no standing room and the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts. 
Like in an airplane, says expert 
Jaroslav Hořín, an expert on traffic safety for the National Strategy for Traffic Safety (BESIP), does not see any essential problem in the movement of stewards on the buses. 
"During a smooth ride, there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared to the service in airplanes. 
Even there it is not certain when turbulence will occur and the stewardess can hit her head." 
"However, if the bus were to brake sharply, of course, the laws of physics are valid. 
Just like in a city bus or a tram. 
The transport provider must deal with the safety of the stewards through internal regulations," he says, and he also thinks that from the legal perspective, this issue is unresolved. 
Jančura willing to discontinue services 
Student Agency is the only bus transport provider to offer the steward service. 
It employs nearly two hundred of them. 
Even after the accident, the head does not consider their job to be risky. 
"But as soon as I gain the impression that the stewards' job is risky, I will discontinue them. 
Passengers can get coffee and newspapers when boarding. 
It would also save costs," he says. 
Alexej Litvin, head of Asiana, which operates a fraction of the bus lines that SA does, explained the absence of stewards in his vehicles as due to safety interests. 
"We don't have stewardesses, we've been against it from the very beginning. 
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," he told Týden.cz nearly a year ago. 
Enormous tragedy occurred 
A young stewardess from the Pilsen area, who had worked for the company for two years, died in an accident on the bus line to Naples. 
A Slovenian tractor trailer truck likely left the emergency lane without signalling and blocked the path of the bus. 
The bus driver tried to avoid it using a sharp manoeuvre, however, the front right part of the bus grazed it. 
Jančura rebuffs the claim that the two seats reserved for the stewards' rest had been sold out. 
"It is not possible to reserve these seats in the coach buses, they are blocked." 
The company plans to sue the driver of the truck. 
The agency will not wait for the court verdict to compensate the girl's family, but it expects financial compensation from the guilty party. 
Adaptation of the law? 
Far away 
An adaptation of the law, on which a thirty-member expert group from the Ministry of Transportation has been working for over a year, could bring about the specification of the movement of stewards on board the buses. 
"But no concrete conclusion has been reached. 
They are not dealing with buses much, it is more the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of cell phones while driving," says expert Hořín. 
"The Ministry of Transportation does not consider the activity of the stewards to be something that would threaten the safety of the passengers in any essential way," concludes speaker Hanzelka, adding that the enforcement of safety in buses is under the jurisdiction of the police and the Labor Safety Office. 
Duesseldorf Hopes Rest in Frankfurt 
In a letter from the WestLB board of directors to the bank's employees, grand talk is not in short supply. 
Combining units of the Duesseldorf institution with Frankfurt's Deka Bank, the notice made public on Monday claims, could `create a major capital-market institution of the Sparkassen Finanzgruppe.' 
WestLB would contribute to the deal a `bloc of expertise' with sustained earning power, it says. 
Generally, the letter suggests, this kind of jointer might provide the pivotal impulse for further concentration in the area of the German state banks, the Landesbanken. 
That's what it sounds like when a board of directors wants to demonstrate being on top of things in difficult times. 
The flagging WestLB is still exposed to tremendous pressure, after all. 
Not just from the EU Commission, but also from the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision, which only recently warned the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there was an urgent need for a solution. 
But talks of some type of jointer between Deka Bank, which savings bank clients are familiar with due to its investment funds, and WestLB have been making the rounds for some time now - even in Frankfurt. 
Presenting the report on the first two quarters in late August, Deka Bank head Franz Waas said a fusion between the institute on Mainzer Landstrasse and a Landesbank, such as Hesse and Thuringia's Helaba or WestLB, made little sense to him. 
But the administrative board of Deka, which is owned in equal parts by the Landesbanken and the savings banks associations, has asked the board of directors to commence talks with WestLB on joint business ventures. 
The possible subject is the capital-market business, or parts of it. 
Of course, as sources in the financial community point out, negotiations have only just begun. 
It's not the first time that the name Deka Bank - with its staff of 3000 one of the more significant employers in the financial center of Frankfurt - crops up in the context of a savings banks consolidation. 
In 2003, a merger of Deka Bank with Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba briefly seemed to be within the realm of possibility. 
But in the end, the threesome didn't happen. 
As soon as the plans became public, the Hessian state government spoke out against the participation of Helaba. 
The two remaining institutions also proved unable to reach an agreement. 
Instead, Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate was bought by Stuttgart's Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg. 
But deliberations on a jointer between Deka Bank and Landesbanken have continued to rear their heads. 
Most recently, Guenther Merl, chairman of the board at Helaba, had quelled considerations of a merger with his institution. 
This aside, there seems to be an increasing awareness that a consolidation of the various institutions in the public sector is imperative. 
First up, now that the state elections in Bavaria are over, a jointer between BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg may have become more likely. 
For Helaba, that's not necessarily good news. 
Should the pressure for more mergers increase, it will by degrees be running out of potential partners. 
In the South, it would merely be a junior partner, although it has to date weathered the financial crisis much better than the institutions in Munich and Stuttgart. 
A merger with WestLB, in turn, was squashed early this year by the Savings Bank Association of Hesse and Thuringia, which owns 85 percent of Helaba. 
Remains only NordLB. 
But such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the equation. 
On the other stands the question in how far the institutions' different business models are compatible with another. 
In June, Merl said that the key issue of finding an appropriate business model to ensure the sustainability of the Landesbanken had not yet been resolved by the German Savings Bank Association. 
Ultimately, WestLB might also be split up, although, of course, that's not a solution favored at WestLB. 
The letter from its board of directors, accordingly, voices the manifest desire for a `comprehensive solution.' 
Quite how this is reconcilable with a jointer between individual units of WestLB and Deka Bank remains to be seen. 
Second Weekend at the `Wiesn' Is Known as `Italian Weekend' 
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca it's the third or fourth already. 
But this time, he brought along his girlfriend Elena, and that changes everything, he says. 
Behind them, next to a five-litre keg of Kaiser beer, stands a massively built bearded man who is proving to the approximately 200 Oktoberfest tourists just how deep the sounds are that his throat his capable of producing. 
Elena first slaps Luca, then kisses him. 
They came to Verona from Bologna. 
From here, a parking lot for buses next to the railroad station Puorta Nuova, four buses will depart at 11:45 tonight, `destinazione Monaco, festa della birra.` Estimated time of arrival: 6:30 AM. 
Three buses are reserved for Italians mainly, one is exclusively for Brazilians. 
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing next to their flag. They were celebrating last night already. 
And very loudly, too, says Marco Guarda - too loudly for Italians. 
Marco, who wears a long coat with fake fur lining and glasses with broad silver earpieces, owns the buses. 
They have been making trips to the Oktoberfest for five years now, three of them this year alone. 
They travel at night, spend the day at the `Wiesn' and head back home again at 10:30 PM. 
Staying over night would only generate unnecessary costs, Marco says. 
The trip is 75 Euros, including a welcoming round of Kaiser beer, brewed according to the Bavarian Purity Law, health insurance, as well as a German-language guide - Marco enrolled in a language course in Frankfurt. 
And with no further ado, the buses head out into the night, on the autostrada leading to `Brennero.' 
There is no beer to be had yet. 
Soon all is quiet in the bus, the travelers are asleep. 
As they should be - they are going to need their strength. 
They stop in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where droves of other buses with Italian plates are making a final stop on the Autobahn 8, right before Munich. 
When Marco's group finally arrives, as planned, at half past six in the morning at a parking lot near Theresienwiese, about 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there. 
Elena, Luca and the others gather. Marco addresses them one last time to give them their marching orders. 
First up: Put on the yellow caps. 
On the left side, they say `Oktoberfest' in Gothic type, next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency, "conoscersiviaggiando.it". 
Second: `When the doors of the beer tent open, you have to run!' Marco shouts into the morning. 
`Run!' Run and man the seats in the rear part of the tent. 
`Not in the front, or else we will block the entry. And not all yellow hats at the same tables - spread out in the room!' 
It's 8.25 Euros per `Maß,' Marco screams. 
And don't forget to tip. 
`Show the security people that we behave! 
As soon as you abandon your seats, they're gone!' 
Third: `Be back here tonight at 10:30 sharp!' Understood? 
And off to the `Wiesn' they go. 
One of them is marking the way by tying yellow caps to trees, signs and even to campaign posters of a political party that's popular in Bavaria. 
They want to be prepared for the retreat. 
It is the second weekend at the `Wiesn,' known as the `Italian Weekend.' 
There are no exact figures; estimates say that around 50,000 make their way across the Alps to descent on the beer tents - ten percent of all visitors on this weekend are said to have arrived from Italy specifically for this purpose. 
Munich's police are reinforced by seven policemen from South Tyrol, and Italian volunteers are lending support to the Bavarian Red Cross, according to whose statistics on nationals the Italians are leading the medical-attention field with about 200 cases, with Austrians (about 80 cases) and Britons (about 60 cases) coming in second and third. 
Italians are especially fond of the `Hofbräu' tent. 
No Sleep for Hypo Real Estate Creditors 
As recently as last week, German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck stressed that the banking system of Germany was relatively stable. 
It's a good thing that the politician used the term `relatively,' further interjecting that the German banking sector wouldn't be spared by the crisis. 
Because that's what happened this weekend. 
The real-estate bank Hypo Real Estate (HRE) from Munich, which is listed in the DAX stock index, is receiving credits in the billions from a consortium of German banks in order to be shielded against the market turbulences. 
An individual close to the proceedings told Reuters on Monday that the credit line could be as high as 35 billion Euros total. 
Hypo Real Estate was only required to pay interest on the sum it ends up using, they said. 
The money was coming from private as well as public banks, they added. 
The news comes in the wake of losses at subsidiary Depfa. 
According to a news report, the government-funding bank had refinanced long-term projects it was financing on very short notice - which, due to the mistrust at the markets, is no longer a possibility. 
In the first half-year of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to 2.37 Euros, with the capital resource quota also slightly declining from 1.6 to 1.45 percent. 
The ongoing earnings and net earnings from financial transactions had fallen to nil compared to the same period in the previous year, while earnings from write-ups on demands and specific bonds as well as from the liquidation of accruals from credit transactions had shrunk by more than 70 percent to 5 million Euros. 
The decline in earnings remained at a moderate 16 percent only thanks to higher earnings through refunds from downstream accounting costs from restructuring the former Depfa Group, as well as from refunds of interest according to the Fiscal Code and from agency for group companies. 
After going private in 1990, the former government-funding bank had initially incurred speculation losses through commercial real-esate credits, which were then outsourced to Aareal Bank. 
Because earnings in classical government-funding were slim, Depfa had diversified internationally, increasingly engaging in infrastructure projects and in the funding of joint ventures between private investors and the government (Public-Private Partnership, PPP). 
Now Hypo Real Estate has to induce write-offs according to the subsidiary's worth that will have a `significant, material effect' on the group's profit-and-loss statement, it said rather vaguely. 
As a matter of fact, the dividend has been omitted. 
It had already been reduced by two thirds in 2007. 
Since the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a significant financer of government and infrastructure. 
Because it does not have client deposits, it is more dependent on refinancing at the interbank market than other banks. 
With the collapse two weeks ago of American investment bank Lehman Brothers, the extension of loans among banks has largely dried up again, because banks are hoarding their assets. 
For part of Depfa's loan portfolio - approximately 50 billion Euros - Hypo Real Estate annually requires short-term capital for refinancing. 
According to Hypo Real Estate, the credits meet the group's financing requirements for the foreseeable future, shielding the corporation from `the influence of the currently largely incapacitated international financial markets.' 
Other sources say that, thanks to the credits, refinancing is covered until late 2009. 
HRE chairman of the board Georg Funke said that, in the foreseeable future, the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to draw upon the financial markets again, however. 
The Deutsche Bundesbank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) are now considering the Hypo Real Estate Group's marketability to be secured. 
On behalf of the bank's shareholders and creditors, it is to be hoped they are right. 
But given the dynamics and the unpredictability of the crisis, things are likely to remain uncertain. 
It's not even unthinkable that not all of the financing will be needed. 
The opposite cannot be discounted either, however. 
After the bank was reportedly close to insolvent late Sunday night, even a bailout, temporary as it is, is incapable of easing people's minds. 
The price per share is dropping by 75 percent to 3.30 Euros. 
Bond prices are holding up reasonably well, meanwhile. 
Whereas senior debts are hardly moving, junior bonds are dropping more significantly. 
This mainly applies to bonds of former subsidiary Wuerttemberg Hypo and, understandably, to repayment periods beyond 2009. 
To date, Hypo Real Estate bonds seemed to be an alternative for speculative investment. After the financial crisis, as well as the bank's own homemade crisis caused by the acquisition of Depfa, however, their recoverability has to be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system. 
As long as central banks, governments and less stricken corporate banks are still willing to support the system, bond settlement deadlines can be met. 
Alternatively, that which nobody dares to hope for yet right now comes to pass, and the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months. 
But considering that one report of partial nationalization is chasing the next, a probability bordering on certainty has now shrunk to a valid hope. 
This may be causing some sleepless nights for long-term creditors in particular, as they ponder the question whether or not to abandon their exposure. 
Short-term investors may at least use the line that has been drawn as an opportunity to draft a loss carry-forward for the capital gains compensation tax payments of the years to come. 
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box 
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, is asked to introduce herself on her first day at Tachibana High School, the girls begin to giggle: The German girl is totally `kawaii'! 
What this means? 
Sylvana is familiar with the term from reading manga - in her new exchange log she tells about Japan. 
`First day at school in Japan. 
I was so excited. 
The way to school alone gave me the jitters. 
I live at the edge of Tokyo, towards Kawasaki, and the train ride to Tachibana High School is 40 minutes. 
I had to find the way on my own, and luckily I didn't get lost. 
The beginning of class isn't organized as strictly as back home in Lower Saxony. 
Students begin trickling in at eight o'clock, until a brief conference with the teacher, the `home room,' starts at 8:40. 
But before class began, it was my turn to introduce myself. 
I'm not someone who likes to talk in front of other people, mind you, let alone a class of 40. 
Because I didn't have a school uniform yet, I was dressed in one of my host mother's old skirts, as well as a blouse, blue stockings and black leather shoes. 
In this attire, I stood before the desk and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is a week from now. 
At that moment, I was very glad that I'd been learning the language for two years already. 
The 31 girls in class were all whispering and giggling among themselves and waving at me, and I kept hearing the word `kawaii.' 
I already knew it from my manga. 
It's part of the essential vocabulary of Japanese girls and means `cute,' `sweet.' 
Then I scurried to my seat. 
The girl beside me was smiling rather brightly. She thought it was an honor that the exchange student should be seated next to her. 
The rest of class was pretty uneventful, but when the bell rang, they were all practically crowding me. 
They were talking all at once and giggled and bombarded me with one question after another, even though Japanese English is really hard to understand. 
Then, during the break, everybody got out their bentos. 
My host mother had prepared such a lunch box for me, too - it's something else than the bleak German lunch break sandwiches. 
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, salad made from cucumber and algae, fruit and some kind of meat in a tofu coat. 
Most of the time I don't have the first clue what I'm eating here in Japan. 
The stuff looks weird and has a completely novel taste. 
I can say this: It's all delicious. 
Well, except for the salty plums in oil, that is. Yeuch! 
At Japanese schools, the bentos aren't just lunch. 
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a homemade bento that she's fixed in a particularly fancy way to a boy, in the hope of getting to know him better during lunch break. 
I read about that in my manga. 
I'm looking forward to finding out whether that's happening here, too. 
`Why Japan, of all places?,' my girlfriends asked when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year. 
And I always told them: 
`Because it happens to fascinate me.' 
After all, manga have been my favorite reading material for years. 
And in order to have a better understanding of the comics and the culture in them, I eventually started to learn a little Japanese, as well. 
So for me it's been a no-brainer that I would have to come here eventually. 
Because I also have a penchant for tradition, manners and customs. 
And those are considered very important here. 
On the one hand, Japan is the land of the latest technologies and trends, but on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional. 
And because everything is so well-organized, I haven't felt lost yet, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen. 
Rats Have Feelings, Too 
When in danger, a rat or roach will run away. Does it mean they experience fear, too? 
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings, as well. 
But if they act the same way we do, how could it be determined whether they also experience the same feelings? 
The Internet magazine `Edge' has been running pieces by famous scientists for years. 
In a series, SPIEGEL ONLINE presents a selection of responses to the question, `What do you consider to be true without being able to prove it?' 
I believe that animals have feelings, as well as other modes of awareness, although neither I nor anybody else have been able to prove it to date. For that matter, we haven't even been able to prove that other people possess awareness. 
But in that case, we can at least hope, since all human brains possess the same basic configuration. 
As soon as we turn to other species and raise questions on feelings or awareness in general, however, we are entering difficult terrain, because the hardware is not compatible. 
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: It plays possum, runs away or attacks. 
Humans behave similarly, which leads some scientists to conclude that the subjective experience is comparable. 
But I don't believe that. 
There are two aspects of our brain structure that make it difficult to project our subjective experience onto animals. 
For one thing, those circuits almost always involved in human awareness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to the part it plays in short-term memory and executive and control functions). 
This broad region is more advanced in humans than it is in other primates, and it seems to be entirely missing in other creatures. 
So at least as far as these aspects of our awareness depending on the prefrontal cortex are concerned - among them the knowledge who we are and the ability to plan and to make decisions - there is reason to assume that humans are distinct even from other primates. 
Another dramatic distinction is likely to consist in man's linguistic nature: Because such a vast part of what humans experience is tied to language, it's often said that their awareness depends on it. 
In that case, animals could be excluded. 
But even if awareness was not dependent on language, it would certainly be affected by it, meaning that animal awareness, however it may be defined, would likely be very different from most of our states of awareness. 
That's why it is so difficult to determine what animal awareness may be like. 
If you have something that, being internal and subjective, can be neither measured nor - due to its special hardware - analyzed according to our own experience, then its study comes with significant challenges. 
My explanation has mostly been concerned with the realm of conscious awareness, but aside from that, there is another important aspect of awareness that is more easily accessible scientifically. 
Animal awareness processes can be studied regardless of their content, and that's exactly what's happening in the study of the short-term memory of primates, particularly when it comes to the example of visualization. 
But this approach, which was followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, is concerned with the neural correlates of awareness rather than the causal mechanisms, which may or may not be identical. 
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the significance of the prefrontal cortex for the generation of the visualization. 
What does this mean for feelings, now? 
Let me remind you that an emotional system like that of fear is triggered in a brain that's aware of its own activity. 
What we call `fear,' consequently, is the mental state we are in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its effects, such as physical reactions) is using virtual memory. 
From that perspective, feelings are closely tied to those regions of the cortex which are unique to primates, and humans in particular. 
In conjunction with the linguistic nature, the result are delicate emotional shades, because through words and grammar we can differentiate between states and categorize them, in order to project them onto others as well. 
In contrast to this, Antonio Damasio supposes, for instance, that feelings result from more primitive activities in the areas of the cortext and the brainstem concerned with bodily sensations. Jaak Pankseep says something similar, but his focus is more on the brainstem. 
Since this network hadn't changed in the course of human evolution, they say, it might well be a cause of cross-species sensations. 
In theory, I can't disagree with that, but I consider it improvable. 
Pankseep argues that what seemed to be fear with rats and humans probably felt like it, as well, in both cases. But how can we determine whether rats and humans feel the same thing when they act in similar ways? 
A roach's response to danger is flight. Does it experience fear? 
As far as I'm concerned, a mere similarity of actions is not sufficient proof for an identity of experiences. 
The neural comparison is helpful, granted: Rats and humans have similar brainstems, whereas roaches do not even have brains. 
But is the brainstem responsible for emotions? 
And even if it could be proved for humans - how would one want to prove it for rats? 
I believe rats and other mammals - maybe even roaches (who knows?) - have emotions. 
But I wouldn't know how to prove it. 
And because their feelings are supposedly fundamentally different from ours (since human awareness is based on specific circuits and on language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats. 
There is the promise of results on the neural level here, in any case, provided the same can be measured in rats and humans. 
Just like I don't study language and awareness in rats, neither do I study their emotions, given that I don't even know if they exist. 
One may consider that to be short-sighted, but I prefer to make progress, rather than to keep hitting a wall. 
I just happen to be a practical emotionalist. 
UEFA President Platini: Reprieve for Poland and Ukraine 
Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Ivan Vasyunik said that preparations would soon be transferred to the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister. 
`The government considers UEFA's decision a display of trust in Ukraine and its ability to host the Eurocup together with Poland,' Vasyunik said. 
`This is no amnesty for our country. 
Work has only just begun, and there is much still to be done in both countries.' 
The two hosts are behind on the schedule for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports. 
Even a reduction of the number of Euro stadiums from eight to six is possible. 
`We cannot waste any more time. 
We have to proceed at great speed now,' said Grigoriy Surkis, president of the Ukrainian soccer association. 
`UEFA will be keeping an eye on us constantly.' 
An even more radical measure was taken in Poland. 
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with independent administrator Robert Zawlocki. 
The commission had been assembled at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslav Drzeviecki. 
There was `the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules,' Drzeviecki told Polish news agency PAP. 
`We have reassured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that preparations for the Euro 2012 will not suffer because of this.' 
In the past season alone, several major-league teams had been convicted for manipulation and sentenced to a forced relegation. Ultimately, even the beginning of the season had to be postponed on short notice. 
Indignant Dennis Quaid Strikes Back 
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about personal matters in an interview - and now she's in trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan called her former husband Dennis Quaid an adulterer. 
The latter is fuming at her - and strikes back. 
Belated marital war between former spouses Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after divorcing, the two Hollywood actors are now engaged in an unsightly - and public - argument. 
In an interview with U.S. magazine `InStyle' last week, Meg Ryan had for the first time addressed the reasons for the failure of the marriage: `Dennis was cheating on me for a long time, and that was very painful.' 
She had only learned about the extent of his unfaithfulness after the divorce, she said. 
The occasion for her candor was Ryan's promotion of her new film `The Women' - which tells the story of an adultery. 
Dennis Quaid's reaction to being portrayed as a cheating husband was unequivocal: It was `outrageous,' the 54-year-old told the `New York Daily News,' that `Meg is repeatedly rehashing and revising the history of our relationship.' 
It was also `regrettable' that their common 16-year-old son Jack was again `publicly reminded of the pain and the upheavals a divorce brings for any child,' he said. 
While Ryan has been living on her own since the divorce, Quaid remarried and recently became the father of twins. 
He concluded his comments with a sideswipe. `My life has moved on, at any rate. 
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family that is doing well.' 
Flight and Hotel Rates Drop 
In the first half-year of 2008, flights and rooms in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year. 
In Germany, flight rates even dropped by as much as 50 percent, a current survey says. 
Rates for flights and hotel rooms have dropped again, according to a survey by travel and financial services provider American Express. 
Analyzing its booking data from the first half-year of 2008, the company found that, after an increase of rates in the first quarter, there was a significant drop in the second quarter. 
Following years of increasing rates in the hotel market, rooms have already become cheaper in many places. 
From January to March, rates in 41 out of 48 analyzed European cities were still increasing by an average 6.9 percent compared to 2007. 
But from April to June, rates had already dropped by 3.6 percent versus the previous year. 
The trend was most visible in Paris and Rome, the survey says, where travelers had to pay between 30 and 37 percent less than a year ago. 
American Express considers the weak dollar to be the reason for this, as it results in a `decreasing desire for travel among American tourists.' 
Financial centers like Frankfurt and London were hit harder by the dropping hotel rates than industry locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger, it further says. 
With an increase of 26.3 percent, hotel rates in the Norwegian city are holding the record for Europe, even. 
Flight rates were also still trending up in the first quarter. 
Due to the increasing cost of kerosene, economy-class travelers had to pay 7.1 percent more on average than in 2007, while rates for more fuel-intensive long-range flights even went up by as much as 29.2 percent. 
From April to June, economy-class flight rates dropped by an average 12.5 percent versus the preceding quarter, whereas business- and first-class price changes were much less noticeable. 
In Germany, rates dropped even more sharply than in other European countries. 
From January to March, rates had increased by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they dropped by 23.6 percent. 
The rates of domestic German flights were halved even, a survey says. 
On the one hand, the sudden drop in rates was the result of the slowing economic growth, the company says. 
Demand was receding in many segments of the air-travel market, it says. 
On the other hand, there was an increase in competitive pressure through the Open Skies Agreement, which deregulates air travel between the U.S. and Europe. 
Among the signs of increasing tension were the cancelation of unprofitable routes at airlines, it says, as well as the high number of airlines filing for bankruptcy in the first half-year of 2008 - in Europe alone, it was 24 airlines, it says.

The Gladbach player joined the game late and missed, lifting the ball to the crossbar. 
His message was concisely phrased and left his throat convincingly. 
He simply knew that he was right. 
`We need the second goal,' Hermann Rieger hissed in the hallway at Hamburg Arena. 
Not a lot was going on in the `catacombs.' The half-time break was over and most people had returned to their seats. 
Rieger was HSV's physiotherapist for nearly three decades. He is held in higher esteem than some other lapsed actors. 
And thus, his plea was heard by the powers that be. 
Assistant Coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in agreement. 
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's Coach-in-Chief, Martin Jol. 
The latter's order is likely to have been a similar one: Get me goal number two! 
It was never executed. 
`Not everything was fun to look at today,' Marcell Jansen later admitted. 
Bastian Reinhardt would also have `wished' for things to be `more relaxed.' 
Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric for scoring the 1-0 (1-0) with his header (11th); and the fact that a very weak Gladbach team proved unable to hit the weak Hamburg team where it hurts. 
`It was a dirty victory,' Martin Jol summed things up. 
This Monday, Hamburg SV turns 121 years old. 
Spectators began celebrating on Saturday evening - themselves, the blue sky above the Arena and the instant chart on the video screen that showed their club as top of the class. 
It's going to be a birthday without a real party. 
`We know where to file this one,' said Marcell Jansen. 
He senses that the chart's intermediate report says more about the unpredictability of the Liga than about the dominance of his HSV. 
The team and its belatedly signed-on new members - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goal-getter Petric, as well as Jansen, who was wooed away from FC Bayern - are slowly finding their form, but they are not shining brightly yet. 
`We need more style and more dribbling,' Jol demanded. 
After the Voting Failure 
Fear is making the rounds on Wall Street. 
Initial reports of the bailout failure at one point resulted in the Dow Jones dropping by 700 points. 
It was the biggest one-day point-drop in its history. 
Later, the Dow Jones somewhat recuperated again. 
Around 8:30 PM the world's most significant market indicator listed with 10,579 points, with a minus of more than five percent. 
The technology stock exchange Nasdaq was at 1548 points, with a minus of more than seven percent. 
In the Dow, the biggest losses were suffered by American Express at this stage, which dropped by 14 percent, as well as by the Bank of America, which lost around twelve percent. 
There were no increases for any shares. 
Shares of the bank Goldman Sachs declined by approximately ten percent. 
Large-scale investor Warren Buffet had bought into the company only a few days ago. 
The bailout included the provision of funds for the acquisition of so-called bad mortgage certificates. 
The sum is not to be disbursed at one go, however, but incrementally. 
In turn, the United States was to obtain stock purchase warrants from the finance companies that could be discharged once share prices were appropriate, in order to reduce the burden on the National Treasury. 
Stock Markets in Europe and the U.S. in Downward Spiral 
The billion-dollar aids for banks in Europe and in the U.S. are not assuaging investors' doubts. 
Shares of the German major bank Hypo Real Estate are declining and dragging down the DAX. 
The U.S. index Dow Jones is declining despite the United States' planned bailout of the financial market. 
Spectacular share losses at Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have plunged the German Stock Index (DAX) into a deep minus. 
Despite the bailout by the German federal government and by private banks, shares of the Munich-based real-estate financer declined by three fourths at one point, while Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent. 
The DAX dropped significantly below the important psychological 6,000-point marker and listed at 5,839 points, with a minus of 3.7 percent. 
Stock markets were brought to their knees all over the world. 
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses. 
Investors feared that the U.S. government's 700-billion-dollar bailout might not suffice to kickstart the financial markets. 
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in the first hour of trade, dropping to 10,809.25 points. 
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan. The vote in the Senate could follow on October 1st. 
The remaining European banks also knew but one direction: In London, the FTSE index initially dropped by 3.2 percent, in Paris the CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent. 
In Asia, the leading Japanese index Nikkei dropped by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 points after initial gains. 
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index declined by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points. 
In India, the leading index Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 points. 
In the MDAX, Arcandor shares dropped after the announcement of a capital increase. 
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim applied for the 23 million new shares. 
The trade and tourism corporation also announced that its shares in Thomas Cook would not be sold. 
Dark Matter Affects Flight of Space Probes 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has had researchers stumped: Dark matter is affecting the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers. 
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct. 
For almost 18 years, the probe `Ulysses' has been flying through space. 
Due to freezing fuel lines, it is now threatening to shut down. 
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion for years - the Swing-By Anomaly. 
The swing-by is a flight maneuver during which space probes gain additional acceleration in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as Earth. 
It enables the probes to save a lot of fuel. 
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens made use of this physical trick, as did the solar probe Ulysses. 
But what researches have been wondering about for years is this: The objects in flight are not behaving precisely in the way we have come to expect according to the venerable law of gravitation. 
Rather, there are irregularities in their speed. 
The probes unexpectedly become faster or slower. 
To date, physicists have been unable to explain this effect. 
They have dubbed it the Swing-By Anomaly. 
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the gravitational pull of matter through a curvature of space, may not be entirely correct. 
The American physicist Stephen Adler at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein did not err, and is trying to explain the Swing-By Anomaly by way of the so-called dark matter that astronomers discovered in the universe. 
`It could be dark matter existing very close to Earth that may be responsible for the anomaly,' he writes. 
Space researchers have only been aware of the existence of dark matter for about ten years. 
Evidently, it emits a gravitational force whose effect on other celestial bodies is measurable. 
The dark matter itself is completely invisible, however, meaning that it neither sends nor emits any electromagnetic radiation whatsoever, such as, consequently, visible light in particular. 
According to the scientists' calculations, dark matter constitutes as much as one fifth of all matter in the universe. 
Abducted Tourists in Egypt Released 
After being held hostage by their captors for ten days, the tourists abducted in Egypt have evidently been released, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister. 
The abductors from Sudan had demanded a ransom of several million Euros. 
In a shoot-out preceding the rescue, six of their captors were reportedly killed. 
In the south of Egypt, five Germans have been abducted. 
Negotiations concerning a ransom are reportedly already underway. 
Time and again, Germans end up in the crosshairs of kidnappers. 
`Welt Online' reports the most notable cases. 
The European tourists abducted in the Sahara have apparently been freed. 
Reports by Egyptian state television, the Arabian TV channel al-Arabiya and Italian media are in accordance on that. 
According to Italian TV channel Sky TG 24, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release: `Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed. 
Right now we are checking their health,' Frattini said. 
The five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian woman and their eight Egyptian companions were safe and sound, Egyptian state television reported. 
The 19 participants of a desert expedition were already on their way to Cairo, it said. 
The circumstances of the shoot-out preceding the release remain unclear: According to an Egyptian security agent, the captors were ready to end the abduction when the Sudanese army suddenly killed six of the abductors. 
`The problem had been solved. 
They had agreed to a ransom,' the agent said. 
It had been `only a matter of receiving the hostages,' when suddenly `this surprise' happened. 
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers had shot dead six of the abductors and taken two as prisoners in the border region between Sudan, Chad and Egypt. 
The abductors had demanded a ransom of six million Euros from Germany; the money was to be delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages. 
Citing a German negotiator, the daily newspaper `El Masri El Jom' reported that the release was being delayed because the kidnappers were fearing for their safety. 
According to the report, the abductors intended to release the female hostages once the ransom had been paid. 
The men were to be held captive until the abductors would have secured an escape route. 
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report. 
Stepfather abuse "led to suicide" 
Years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself, a court has been told. 
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after he admitted eight counts of indecent assault. 
Truro Crown Court heard he regularly tied up his step-daughter Stephanie Randle, when she was aged between five and seven. 
Trerise wrote in a confession note: "I feel responsible for her death." 
The court heard that Ms Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, aged 34. 
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and blindfolded her before performing sexual acts, while her mother was out working at a pub. 
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall. 
His step-daughter went to Plymouth. 
But the court heard that Ms Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was haunted by the abuse which had been inflicted on her twice-weekly. 
By 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court, friends said Ms Randle, who had been a keen surfer and cyclist, was "emotionally dead", and had "given up on life". 
In April 2007 her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead at her flat in Plymouth. 
She is thought to have killed herself through suffocation using a plastic bag. 
Mr Randle confronted his daughter's step-father, who wrote a confession letter which ended: "I used to tie her up and blindfold her. 
"I didn't sexually assault her. 
I feel responsible for her death." 
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven. 
"This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking her own life. 
Even more stark, is the fact that had she not done so, it's very doubtful that matters would have ended up in court." 
He added: "I note the effect Stephanie's father and mother describe your crime having on their daughter over the years. 
"She was plainly otherwise likely to have been a promising, successful and happy young woman." 
Lost data official to be charged 
The Cabinet Office official who left top-secret documents on a train in June is to be charged under the Official Secrets Act, the BBC has learned. 
The man was on secondment from the Ministry of Defence when he left two highly classified documents on a train to Waterloo. 
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police. 
It is the least sensitive charge under the act and there is no suggestion of criminal intent. 
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the move would have come as a surprise to many in Whitehall. 
"They will have thought this was being dealt with internally at the MoD and Cabinet Office," he said. 
The employee, who cannot be named, is being charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause which deals with safeguarding information. 
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended the official should be charged by the Metropolitan Police due to the highly sensitive nature of his work on the Joint Intelligence Committee. 
The documents he misplaced contained classified assessments about al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraq's security forces. 
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from his home to an undisclosed location. 
Building societies face B&B bill 
Britain's building societies could face a bill of more than £80m after the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank. 
The Government provided £14bn to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million savers. 
The interest on that loan will be paid by all firms that take savers' money, including the 59 building societies. 
The director general of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it was "galling" that societies and their members had to pay. 
The £14bn loan will eventually be repaid as Bradford & Bingley's mortgages are redeemed. 
But the interest which will accrue in the meantime will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies which take deposits. 
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building societies would be included in that number. 
It is galling that those institutions that behaved prudently ... are now being called upon to pay some of the bills of those institutions that were far less prudent 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
It said each firm had to pay in proportion to the deposits it held, and that the societies between them had to pay about 18% of the cost. 
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to £450m in 2009. 
That means the societies will have to find £81m to pay the first year's interest. 
Adrian Coles, director general of the building societies' trade association, told the BBC he believes that is unfair. 
"It is galling that those institutions that behaved prudently in the housing market upswing are now being called upon to pay some of the bills of those institutions that were far less prudent." 
According to the BSA, no society has failed since its records began in 1945. 
"We will need to examine all the aspects of this over the next few weeks to see what options there are to protect building societies and their members from what could be a significant bill," added Mr Cole. 
The interest due in 2009 cover seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March. 
In 2010 a full year's interest will be due and that could be almost twice as much. 
Since building societies are mutual organisations with no shareholders, their members will end up paying the bill either through higher charges or lower interest rates on saving accounts. 
Milk to go up five pence a litre 
People in Jersey are facing having to pay more for their milk. 
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by an extra five pence a litre from Monday. 
It is the second price increase this year, following a two pence rise in February, and comes after research carried out by a consultancy company. 
Retailers are to decide for themselves if they want pass on the price increases to their customers. 
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002. 
Bangladesh ex-PM is denied bail 
A Bangladesh court has rejected a bail plea of former PM Sheikh Hasina, meaning that she could be arrested when she returns to the country. 
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail over charges of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when she was PM. 
The case is one of several corruption charges pending against her. 
Sheikh Hasina's long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month. 
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh over the next few weeks but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country's military-backed caretaker government should first give her full freedom. 
Correspondents say that while she was given parole to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear under the terms of her release whether she will be able to remain at liberty when she returns to Bangladesh. 
Her lawyers say that she will now appeal in the Supreme Court against the High Court order. 
"The High Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail petition saying that she doesn't have to get bail as she's already undergoing treatment abroad on parole," her barrister Rafique-ul Huq said. 
"We'll file an appeal against the High Court order." 
Her lawyers argued that she needed bail to come back to the country from abroad to prepare for elections in December. 
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after 17 October, a senior Awami League party leader said on Sunday. 
She was detained last year after the army-backed interim government assumed power, but was released from prison in June, to go abroad for medical treatment. 
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against them. 
Fears for Afghan anti-polio drive 
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan missed out on a recent polio immunisation drive because of violence linked to the Taleban, the UN says. 
The UN carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week. 
But it says it could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons. 
A UN spokesman said this was despite pledges from the Taleban that they would not attack or obstruct thousands of staff carrying out the vaccinations. 
BSkyB loses ITV legal challenge 
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge to the Competition Commission's decision forcing the firm to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV. 
BSkyB has been told by the Competition Appeal Tribunal to cut its holding in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%. 
Previously, the commission said that BSkyB's stake thwarted competition and allowed it unfair influence over ITV. 
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a deal which effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV. 
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that BSkyB's acquisition of its stake in ITV shed doubt on the independence of ITV, prompting the Competition Commission to launch a probe. 
Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the regulator Ofcom all opposed the purchase. 
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights. 
New probe into US attorney affair 
The US attorney general has appointed a special prosecutor to look into the firing of nine US attorneys in 2006. 
The move came as a report into the affair by the inspector general of the justice department criticised the actions of administration officials. 
The report was critical of White House officials, lawmakers and the former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. 
The investigation was prompted by fears that the attorneys had been removed for political reasons. 
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials questioned during the probe lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice. 
"Serious allegations involving potential criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report. 
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations. 
The row began when nine US attorneys were removed from their positions by the US Department of Justice in December 2006. 
At the time, the department said that the attorneys had been fired for poor performance. 
But it later emerged that the fired attorneys had not been rated any more poorly than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the sackings had been politically-motivated. 
Some of the attorneys had been involved in the prosecution of high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats. 
US attorneys investigate and prosecute court cases for the government. 
They can be dismissed at any time, but may not be removed for political reasons. 
The then head of the justice department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for the sackings, and eventually resigned his position. 
A number of other justice department officials also resigned. 
The inspector general's report was highly critical of Mr Gonzales's role in the affair, saying he bore "primary responsibility" for the sackings, that he "abdicated" his leadership role and was "remarkably unengaged" in the process. 
Other officials, including former senior Bush aide Karl Rove, were criticised for failing to co-operate with the investigation. 
Meat Loaf's epic to be honoured 
Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honoured at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell. 
The singer, who will collect his special golden award at next week's ceremony in London, said he was "honoured" to gain recognition. 
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track to Meat Loaf's hit 1977 album. 
Coldplay are leading the nominations for this year's awards, making the shortlists of four categories. 
Paul Rees, Q magazine's editor-in-chief, said: "There are some songs that transcend such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is assuredly one of them." 
The song, penned by Jim Steinman, required a huge vocal which was delivered by Meat Loaf. 
It opened with an instrumental section which lasted almost two minutes. 
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and peaked at number 15. 
But Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell album spent around nine years in the chart and went on to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide. 
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage. 
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts. 
It later emerged that he had a cyst on his vocal chord. 
Obscure City Street, Often Forgotten and Perhaps Soon for Sale 
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other byways, some famous, others merely utilitarian. 
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime local residents find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it. 
The tiny street is in the East Village and runs north from First Street - without making it to Second Street - between the Bowery and Second Avenue. 
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it resembles a dusty alleyway more than an active thoroughfare. 
There are no street signs. 
It is virtually impossible to see on a standard atlas. 
The street does, however, have admirers. 
For instance, there is Avalon Bay, the developer of recently constructed luxury buildings on First Street. 
It wants to repave Extra Place and create a cleaner passageway to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings. 
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who said they were charmed by the truncated lane simply because it was one of the last remnants of the block's pregentrified past. 
But the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which has control of the street, has no interest in holding on to it. 
At a meeting of the neighborhood community board's land use committee this month, representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the developer to buy the street. 
But the committee prefers that the street remain in the city's hands, and it asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the district manager of Community Board 3. 
"There's very little city-owned space left, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," she said. 
"There could be proposals to fix it up and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public access." 
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repave the little street and install seats, including some to be used by a cafe to which the developer expects to lease space. 
The idea that Avalon Bay might buy the street was first made public at this month's meeting. 
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that though the company wanted to use the street, it did not necessarily want to own it. 
"Avalon Bay's principal concern is refurbishing this derelict alleyway and turning it into a public amenity," she said, adding that the city had suggested the sale. 
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Housing Preservation, said it was indeed the city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission was to develop property rather than manage it. 
Compared with its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a light historical footprint. 
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was split up among several of his children and the narrow strip of land was unclaimed. 
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened onto Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as the setting for the cover photograph of the Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia." 
"The ground was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976. 
"It was filled with junk, shreds of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes." 
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public. 
Others have lauded Extra Place as a rarity - a virtually unchanged sliver of the city that ought to be left alone. 
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), posted part of a Talk of the Town story about Extra Place that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow little dead-end street, dark even by day and marked off by rusty iron warehouse doors and shuttered windows, with week-old newspapers blowing along the gutters." 
With a few exceptions, the street looked much the same on a recent evening. 
A rat skittered across the back of the street near a door that used to lead into CBGB, which is now the site of an upscale clothing store. 
Graffiti was on walls and an empty 22-ounce beer bottle lay near a fresh batch of discarded newspapers. 
A few passersby said that they rarely thought about Extra Place but suggested that it could use some sprucing up. 
Mr. Fields, for his part, said he thought that some people were underestimating the appeal of the street in its current state. 
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in places that were dark, damp and disgusting." 
The Bilingual Debate: English Immersion 
In this installment of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' positions on bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, a senior fellow in California studies and the senior director of education studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice." 
Making effective appeals to Hispanic voters is a tricky business. 
Barack Obama's education proposals are a case in point. 
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that, "African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true. 
To combat such achievement gaps, Mr. Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English-learners. 
Yet, the question for Mr. Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes classroom instruction in languages other than English, overrides his interest in closing achievement gaps. 
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County. 
The school's students are overwhelmingly Hispanic and low income. 
More than a third of the students, many of whom are recent arrivals, are learning English. 
Yet, among fourth graders, an astounding 100 percent of the students tested at the proficient level on the 2008 state math exam. 
A nearly equally amazing 93 percent of fourth graders tested proficient on the state English-language-arts exam. 
This incredible success was achieved using a different ingredient than the one favored by Mr. Obama. 
Sixth Street emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of skills and a no-excuses attitude. 
Furthermore, and here's where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, Sixth Street's principal, the school's instructional approach for English learners is "full immersion." 
English immersion emphasizes the near-exclusive use of English in content instruction. 
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "we've had tremendous success with having a student who is brand new from Mexico and you would walk into a classroom 12 months later and you wouldn't be able to pick out which one he was." 
"It's working," she observed, "it's working for us." 
Would Mr. Obama hold up a school like Sixth Street Prep as one model for replication by other schools with large Hispanic and English-learner populations? 
The school's achievement results should make the answer to that question a no-brainer, but the education politics within his own party (the National Education Associations has been a long-time supporter of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education obscure predicting Mr. Obama's response. 
While he agrees that immigrants should learn English, Mr. Obama recently trivialized the issue when he said that people should stop worrying about "English-only" legislation. 
Instead, he said, "you need to make sure your child can speak Spanish." 
If Mr. Obama truly wishes to close achievement gaps, he should carefully consider education models that work rather than scorn or trivialize them. 
Oil Falls Sharply on Renewed Economic Fears 
Oil prices dropped sharply on Monday because of concerns that even the American bailout plan for the financial markets may fail to revive the economy. 
Crude oil futures fell as much as 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange in morning trading. 
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since last Monday. 
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil on Wall Street, and a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. 
After reaching a high of $145.29 a barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before once again jumping back up on the back of tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets. 
Anxiety gripped investors once again on Monday even after Congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement over the weekend about the bailout plan, the largest in history. 
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over. 
In the latest episode of the unfolding meltdown, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, the government said Monday. 
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis. 
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the frantic weekend negotiations that led to the bailout agreement "appear to have failed to revive market sentiment." 
As the economic situation deteriorates, the demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to slow down. 
"The outlook for global equity, interest rate and exchange rate markets has become increasingly uncertain," analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to investors. 
"We believe commodities will be unable to escape the contagion. 
From a commodity perspective our most pressing concern is to what extent the US virus spreads globally and specifically to China." 
The bank's analysts pared down their expectations for next year as oil consumption drops because of slowing economic growth, reducing their oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009. 
Second-Quarter Spree Sets Team Record 
After spending more time in a Jets uniform the last eight-plus seasons than anyone, defensive end Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all. 
Then he watched the second quarter unfold Sunday, when the Jets transformed a scoreless game into a blowout. 
"Never seen anything quite like that," Ellis said. 
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had matched the gloomy clouds hanging overhead with sloppy play. 
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown strike, providing the perfect harbinger for an afternoon when their evolving connection took a giant leap forward. 
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the quarter, including one when a cornerback fell down and another with 10 seconds left in the half. 
"I didn't go out of my way," Favre said of all the passes that went to Coles. 
"He's a hell of a player. 
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think." 
While Favre and Coles played catch, the defense battered Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner. 
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted an errant throw and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown. 
Safety Eric Smith tipped another pass and intercepted it. 
Linebacker David Bowens forced a fumble by Warner. 
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, might have been the most egregious. 
The Cardinals had taken over on that possession with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal for a 34-0 lead. 
It was the most the Jets had ever scored in a quarter. 
Asked to describe the craziness of it, Jets Coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?" 
When he was told both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you I enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than I did the third quarter. 
There were a lot of points scored in a short amount of time." 
Rested Gebrselassie Tops His World Record 
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia again showed why many consider him the greatest distance runner ever, breaking his own world record in the marathon in Berlin on Sunday and becoming the first person to run the 26.2-mile race under 2 hours 4 minutes. 
With a victory on the accommodatingly flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shattered by 27 seconds his previous mark of 2:04:26, run last year in Berlin. 
At 35, Gebrselassie set the 26th world record of a career of such stunning breadth that he has produced a world championship or world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon. 
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that the air pollution would exacerbate his problems with asthma. 
Instead, he signed to run in Berlin. 
In near perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won Sunday while averaging a blistering 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile. 
As track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have turned to longer distances, the record for the marathon has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998. 
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and had missed a week of training. 
Clearly, the layoff left him fresh, not rusty. 
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters. 
"Everything was perfect. 
I started again a week ago, and had some doubts today, but in the end everything was fine." 
He has come under some criticism - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for overly orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world's top marathon stars, relying on pacemakers as if it were a track race, and placing world records ahead of a sense of competition. 
But this criticism hardly diminishes the greatness of Gebrselassie's skill as a distance runner. 
Paced by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the midway point in 1:02:04. 
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, kept challenging Gebrselassie after the pacemakers faded. 
A little more than three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made a final surge to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by nearly five minutes. 
Kamathi took third in 2:07:48. 
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19, the seventh-fastest time ever. 
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25. 
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14. 
She missed the Beijing Games with what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin, setting a personal best by nearly five minutes in the third marathon she has run. 
She ran a race of smart calculation, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners break out to a wide lead, then reeling them after about 18 ½ miles. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia took second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01. 
In a Town Apart, the Pride and Trials of Black Life 
Hidden in the theme-park sprawl of greater Orlando, a few miles from the shiny, the loud and the gargantuan, lies a quiet town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience come to life. 
Eatonville, the first all-black town to incorporate in the country and the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty guavas, two schools and no jailhouse." 
It is now a place of pilgrimage. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to pay their respects to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And yet in many ways, the town she described - and made a tourist stop by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project - remains a place apart. 
It is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little about us, he doesn't know what he is missing." 
Even now, in a year when a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, has called for an open conversation about race, many here remain wary of the outsider's gaze. 
"We're very cautious about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the town's oldest church. 
"It needs to be right." 
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle. 
It is both a historic model of black empowerment and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rates are twice the national average. 
It is a literary hub but also an oak-shaded example of rural Southern black culture - sometimes disdained, sometimes praised - that was born of American slavery. 
Not surprisingly, residents here are both proud and protective. 
And the concern about Eatonville's image really began with Zora, which is all anyone here calls Hurston. 
She introduced the world to her hometown through heartfelt, dialect-heavy books like "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937). 
Five paragraphs in the Florida guidebook transformed the town, just off Route 17, a road that runs through the oft-forgotten center of Florida into a stage of black history and human drama. 
Bold as a bass drum in both life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, then veered into more private areas. 
"Off the road on the left," she wrote, "is the brown-with-white-trim modern public school, with its well-kept yards and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always looks after, though he can scarcely read and write." 
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever goes with transient rooms." 
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville with self-government but also illiteracy, remarriage and sex. 
Clearly, Fodor's this was not. 
In fact, it was not a portrait everyone appreciated. 
"Zora told it like it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls Hurston immortalized by quoting men singing off-color songs about their beauty. 
She added: "Some people didn't like that." 
Hurston is still remembered here as a vivacious eccentric who frequently returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Fla. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston sped into town, she usually arrived without notice in a thumping Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a town that even today prides itself on dignified dress. 
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many sneered. 
"People were always glad to see Zora," Mr. Franklin said. 
But, he added, rocking in his chair on a back patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never did stay too long." 
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books had fallen out of print. 
Along with much of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her. 
Though she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had been living. 
In Eatonville, there were no major memorial services, no grand public readings. 
"I don't think they understood her contribution to the world or her legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a Hurston biography published in 2003. 
A turning point came in the 1980s. 
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane highway through town to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community's puttering two-lane main street. 
Orlando's sprawl had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of town. 
The proposal came as Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history. 
Forced integration, among other things, had ended the community's relatively idyllic isolation. 
In the 1950s, the fight over racial mixing brought hate to the community's doorstep. 
"During that time, a bunch of white boys, they would come through and throw oranges and things at people sitting down on the side," Mr. Franklin said. 
"We actually had a lady that got killed from that once. 
They threw a watermelon out of the car." 
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand for forced integration, calling its decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than honoring my race." 
Residents now say that the desegregation of schools, while positive in some respects, diluted Eatonville's cohesiveness and undermined the confidence of its youth. 
"Black children were accustomed to being hugged - I remember this - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher at night," said N. Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit group. 
That lasted, she added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place. 
"You were not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide there," Ms. Nathiri said. 
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who rose above prejudice, like she did, with buoyant self-assurance and lines like: "How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! 
It's beyond me." 
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker trekked to Hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting to resurrect her reputation. 
Five years later, an acclaimed Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway hit bookshelves, reintroducing her to the American canon. 
The highway project arrived just as Eatonville's most famous daughter had once again found the spotlight. 
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior. 
The community began planning in 1988 for a Hurston festival to show what the county could ruin with its highway. 
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and each January, many return for the celebration. 
After several years, the county backed away from its road proposal. 
"The five-laning of the highway resurrected, it put in what you'd call warp speed, real civic pride," Ms. Nathiri said. 
Ms. Boyd put it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville." 
Victory over the highway project has helped change the town's self-image. 
Out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, started to appear in larger numbers, and residents started to revalue the past. 
Eatonville joined the national historic registry in 1998. 
A new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a repaved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard. 
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: only six miles from downtown Orlando, it can, at times, feel like a back street in a summer rain, as small as it did when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1880s. 
(It is 90 percent black today.) 
Outsiders who come looking for Eatonville's story, its meaning, are often still treated with caution. 
Advance permission is required for most interviews, and certain things - like the murals at Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man, showing black men in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a bold, confident teacher partial to bright red, still fear that their insular community will be misunderstood. 
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a heightened level of hometown pride has also emerged. 
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, problems and all, no better, no worse and as proud, creative, hard-working, silly and mixed-up as other racial and ethnic groups in America. 
It is sincere civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to come back to Eatonville after college to work in local government or for the Police Department, which he said could use some help. 
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly. 
"Most people, if they just drive through here, they'll think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any of the other ones,' " Alondra Kenon said after church on a recent Sunday. 
"But if you actually stop and take a moment to look at the history, it's a very nice city." 
Over here in New York we all speak fluent finance 
On the face of it, nothing has changed. 
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from newsstands and the gargantuan television screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realise they were standing in the eye of a storm. 
They would never guess that in the glass-fronted, honeycomb offices above their heads the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolise New York are daily having the worst "bad day at the office" since the crash of 1929. 
Delivery boys still rattle metal tea trolleys across sidewalks, ferrying trays of muffins for breakfast meetings. 
Latino men still shuffle between apartment buildings carrying, like human mules, 50-odd pressed shirts hanging from a yoke across their shoulders. 
Office workers still wait in line for their morning bagel at pavement food carts, and it is still impossible to get a yellow cab between 4pm and 7pm on a weekday. 
It didn't feel as if there was a crisis at all, until, with all the talk of doom and gloom, I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon. 
Even though I had timed the chore to coincide with the late afternoon lull at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, a queue of 20 or so people was already waiting in line. 
Not in front of the teller windows, to withdraw cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service desk, where older clients order cheque books, tourists ask for directions to Macy's department store and new customers open accounts. 
Most of those ahead of me, I was to learn later from Starr, my "licensed personal banker", were lining up for the same reason as me. 
Unlike me, however, they had already withdrawn savings from smaller banks in places from where they commuted, from the likes of New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island. 
They had taken out money from so-called thrifts (a bit like a building society), credit unions and the type of hometown savings banks whose branches only operate within one state, and who say they treat customers like family. 
In the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly gone bust. 
In the last few days Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion of assets, went into receivership, and as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was on the hunt for a rescue buyer. 
The office and shop workers standing in front of me, scared of another collapse, were moving their cash to a bank perceived to be a safe haven, the bank that is doing most of the bailing out on Wall Street. 
Ordinary New Yorkers in the last few weeks have become fluent in finance. 
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket, speaking into her phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bust bank, and its gaunt-looking chief executive Dick Fuld with all the familiarity as if she were bitching about an idle colleague. 
And Lyn, the uniformed, fifty-something concierge of my apartment block, has changed tack from our normal topic of conversation about Brad and Angelina or my grocery delivery. 
She told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I got all my savings in money market funds now. 
I've switched, I'm not taking any risks." 
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria swings to the right 
Heinz-Christian Strache, left of the Austrian right-wing Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of Belgian right wing party Vlaams Belang, take part in a manifestation to present the organisation of "Cities against Islamisation" in Antwerp, Thursday 17 January 2008. 
They carry traffic-style signs depicting mosques with a red line running through. 
Police are blaming far Right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that the political parties of the far Right made huge gains in the country's general election. 
Over 90 graves were severely damaged at the cemetery in Traun, near Linz, some time between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organised action. 
The offenders sprayed Jewish symbols such as the Star of David over some of the graves, but detectives believe this may have been a bid to disguise the motives of extremists driven by a hatred of Muslim immigrants. 
It is not clear whether the incident was in any way related to the elections. 
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" at the news of the desecration, which comes as the Muslim religious month of Ramadan nears its end. 
Austria is meanwhile embarking on a round of soul-searching following its swing to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections. 
The two far-Right parties that captured almost 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have campaigned on an vehemently anti-immigration ticket and some of their slogans were deemed xenophobic by critics. 
Heinz-Christian Strache, the head of the Freedom Party that won over 18 per cent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burkas and even expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to be related to Islam. 
At his final rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam. 
Both parties seek to ban the building of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were political symbols of an ongoing Islamisation of Austria and Europe. 
Polls and analysis conducted immediately after the elections, which established the far Right as the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that the change was brought about by predominately young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union. 
Gary Glitter banned from trip abroad 
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star convicted of child sex abuse, has been banned by the courts from travelling to France and Spain. 
Magistrates imposed the six month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities monitoring him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France. 
Police in Kent were granted the foreign travel ban last Thursday after giving magistrates evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for child sex abuse. 
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Magistrates court in Kent but he was represented by solicitors Corker Binning. 
A Court Service spokesman said:"On Thursday September 25 at Ashford Magistrates' Court, Kent Police applied for an application to prevent foreign travel to France and Spain until March 25 by Mr Paul Gadd. 
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person." 
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad as he is required to under the sex offenders register. 
He must give the authorities notice if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days. 
He is also required to give police seven days notice of his planned departure date. 
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a five year prison sentence. 
Kent Police said they would not discuss individual cases or the possible whereabouts of Glitter in the county. 
A Kent Police spokeswoman said: "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country, or abroad. 
"From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have comprehensive systems in place to manage any potential risks more effectively. 
"Protecting the residents of Kent is the paramount concern of Kent Police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the county to minimise any risk to the public that may exist." 
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese jail for the abuse of two girls, aged 10 and 11. 
When he was freed Glitter flew to Bangkok where he was due to board a flight to London. 
But he said he felt ill and refused to fly to London. 
The Thai authorities would not allow him through passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong. 
Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to Britain. 
He eventually arrived at Heathrow's Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his solicitor David Corker went to Uxbridge Magistrates Court, west London, as Scotland Yard successfully applied for an order requiring him to register as a sex offender. 
Glitter had previously been jailed in the UK for four months in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse. 
A Home Office source said that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary was reassured and glad that Glitter has been stopped from travelling to France and Spain. 
"I photograph the master away from the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer, photographer 
Neither heels nor ruffles or stage clothes. 
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration which characterizes the interpretation, to face a relaxed man or woman. 
On one hand, the artist. 
On the other, the person. 
The two sides are inseparable, except in private life. In those moments, away from the public, the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen glance or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural expressions because not prepared for the stage. 
German Günther Bauer, in the work "Flamenco-People", alternates the theatricality of some shots of singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with these masters' private and less known being. 
This is the photograph's aim when collecting an original iconography of flamenco, taken from different perspectives. 
The exhibition, included in the Month of Flamenco Photography's program, reflects the importance of international flamenco, which increases day by day" the artist explains. He also clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" even it should be ordinary people, going through the pictures, the observers get these are not the classic images of artists, interpreters or performers on stage. 
The people I portrayed on the street "are" artists able to convey passion, sadness and joy when on stage ... and finally, to capture their audience. 
To catch the personality of these artists taking pictures of the scene is over. 
It is much more an inner personality and character. 
I'm very interested in creating an intimate atmosphere which permits me to capture the personality of the greats of flamenco by my camera." 
Bauer began his path to portray singers, guitarists and dancers in 1997 with a deep passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas". He likes to use a plate camera. 
Due to the choice of the camera and the equipment, These portraits remember the classic photos. 
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the iconographic traditional principles, giving the photos modernity, as Bauer considers flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots which evolves and still surprises every day more." 
It is not the dancing, the singing or the playing itself, but the artist's personality, his character, able to conquer the audience through his art. 
The search for a meeting with the essentiality, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain feeling, are and have been constant elements in this work, now on display at the gallery El Fotómata. 
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chan Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrija, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo among others, are included in this selection of around seventy portrayed artists. 
The project has also become an anthology of flamenco, going to be published in a book which collects the portraits displayed at the exhibition. 
The passion for the portrait led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes"("SportARTproject"). 
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, to know them and to penetrate into their lives for a while, being this a long or short moment. 
I think portray is the most difficult subject in photography. 
You meet or face people and characters sometimes you even know or persons who bestow you only a few minutes to take the picture. 
Beyond circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas." 
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is exhibited at the gallery El Fotómata, Via de la Mata 20, which is a parallel street to Alameda de Hercules. The exhibition will be open to public until the 16th of October. 
Vargas Llosa admits the novel he's writing is a "chance" 
The novel sets in a place the author does not know yet and tells of an unknown subject. Despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with the new project he is working at, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who spent twenty years of his life in Congo and crossed Amazon. 
The writer, always favoured for the Nobel Prize in Literature, confessed yesterday during the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the draft he is dealing with is a "chance" and that everything indicates that I should not write it down." 
"If I had good sense, I do not write it at all, but I'm going ahead anyway and I hope to finish it once and for all," he concluded his speech at this festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that saw many guests, during the four days, passing by the Aqueduct's city. Hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people joined it. 
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was a prominent figure in the third edition of the word's festival, as forecasted. 
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize being the most voted writer by participants - an ancient edition of "Our mutual friend" by Dickens, packed the theatre Juan Bravo with fans. 
Introduced by Félix Romeo, the writer faced a public whose time flew away when the Peruvian author, started to recall with a prodigious memory and with large doses of humour, the way he discovered his literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure and the pleasure of reading." This is "living beyond life", as he put it in. He explained why orderly basis in writing permits "to remove the lack of inspiration," through an intense work of documentation, editing and revising. He underlined how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas affected his vocation and said that the "images of memory" are the foundation from which his stories spring up. 
The Hispanic-American novelist, acknowledged that "there is no way to measure how and how much books can affect people's lives. I refuse to believe that literature is a pure and ephemeral entertainment experience," said Vargas Llosa who, also supported that "the literature has a strong impact and pushes people to be nonconformist." So he suggested the writers "not to give into frivolity" and to "take the responsibility" of their own vocation. 
Weather hampers the Pozoblanco festival, which remains with no bullfights 
The bullfights which were to seal the days of the festival of Pozoblanco were suspended yesterday morning after the bull fighters had assured that the square's soil conditions were not adequate for the celebrations. 
Therefore, the company, together with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the bullfighting. 
The weather was rather fierce against this Festival and prevented two over three celebrations. 
Saturday, the rain had prevented the holding of the second bullfight. 
The billboard included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who would have faced a bull of Castilblanco. 
So far, the only celebration took place on Friday. 
This was the triumph of Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and was brought on shoulders after he had bull fought with taste and aesthetics. 
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two bullfights and collected greetings and one ear, granted by the public more than by the quality of the bullfight itself. 
Among all, the worst was El Juli, who passed by the bull-ring of Los Llanos gaining no glory, no penalty. 
With the second bull, after a tremendous muleta, he earned the boos of a bigger part of the public. 
A van loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish skips a road block in Alava 
Ten to six in the morning. 
Traffic control by the Ertzaintza in the municipal district of Armiñón (Alava). 
The officials order the two occupants of a van to stop but they, instead, give to flee. 
Their cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason for not stopping. 
The officers chase after them, are succeed in arresting one over two occupants. The man, 28 years old, is identified as A. A. J., as reported in a press release by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government. 
The arrested person is charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents. 
This occurred when some officials of the Alava Highway Police were conducting an audit of transports along the N-1, at the point which it crosses the district town of Armiñón. 
They were going to stop a van for inspection when the driver, breached of the orders, sharply accelerated and just skipped the road block. 
The officials chased the van until the vehicle stopped after a couple of miles on the edge of the road, and its two occupants flew into a wooded area. 
The Ertzaintza officials managed to arrest one of the fugitives and, after the inspection of the van – an Iveco Daily, seized 2178 kilograms of hashish. 
The blocks of hashish, which were located in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently placed under police custody for a deep investigation and detection of weight. 
Moreover, since officials found that the chassis number had been "duplicated" because it did not coincide with the one reported in the van's documentation, the arrested man was also charged for public documents' falsification. 
The Ertzaintza is continuing its investigations to arrest the second suspected person who managed to flee as mentioned above, and to determine the origin of seized drugs. 
The prisoner, A. A. J., 28 years old, was conducted to the police station to perform the appropriate procedures. He will be available to the court in the coming hours. 
The actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving while addicted with drugs 
The actress Heather Locklear, Amanda of the popular series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) after driving under the influence of drugs. 
A witness viewed her performing inappropriate maneuvers while trying to take her car out from a parking in Montecito, as revealed to People magazine by a spokesman for the Californian Highway Police. 
The witness stated that around 4.30pm Ms. Locklear "crushed the accelerator very thoroughly, making excessive noise and trying to take the car out from the parking with abrupt back and forth maneuvers. By reversing, she passed several times in front of his sunglasses." 
Shortly after, the witness, who, in a first time, apparently had not recognized the actress, saw Ms. Locklear stopping in a nearby street and leaving the vehicle. 
It was this person to alert the emergency services, because "he was concerned about Ms. Locklear's life." 
When the patrol arrived, the police found the actress sitting inside her car, which was partially blocking the road. 
"She seemed confused," and for this reason the policemen led her to a specialized centre for drugs and alcohol and submitted her a test. 
According to a spokesman for the police, the actress has proven collaborative and the hypothesis of excessive alcohol was discarded since the very first moment, even if "as the officers observed at first sight, we believe Ms. Locklear was under the effect of any drug." 
Ms. Locklear was arrested under suspicion of driving under the influence of some - not better specified substance, and imprisoned in the local jail at 7.00pm, to be released some hours later. 
Two months ago, Ms. Locklear was out of a specialist clinic in Arizona where she was cured after an episode of anxiety and depression. 
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of IU to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case 
Gaspar Llamazares, the general coordinator of IU and member of the party Izquierda Unida, confirmed today that the decision for the case concerning the councillor for Youth and Sport of the city of Siviglia, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after the accusation of cronyism. The case will be up to the regional federation for training. 
"I'm very federalist when considering this kind of issues, and the Andalusian organization needs to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the resolution the party should adopt with the man who was an alderman in Siviglian board until now. 
Moreover, the leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding whatever irregularity Silva had committed, "The UI always wanted these kind of investigations to have the maximum transparency." 
Similarly, he stressed that training goes under "very strict codes of ethics for all public functions." 
"Sangre de mayo", an epic challenge by Garci. 
Jose Luis Garci, inspired by the novel Episodios Nacionales of Banito Pérez Galdós, recreates in Sangre de mayo the spanish popular riot against the French. This is the most ambitious work of his filmography, with a nearly 15 million euro budget. 
With this film, the director has tried to "explain the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he said today, during the film's presentation, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría heading a larger cast of interpreters. 
Sangre de mayo, a film longer than 2.30 hours, debuts this Friday at the cinemas, to become a four hours TV miniseries on TeleMadrid in next future. 
Great fan of Galdós' literature, Jose Luis Garci claims this shooting realized "a dream of his childhood". He likes to thank Esperanza Aguirre, who, three years earlier, had commissioned him to shoot a film to commemorate the second centenary of the Madrid 2nd of May. This was the desire expressed by the Community of Madrid. The director agreed on condition that the story grounded on the novel Episodios Nacionales. 
The 15 million budget totally allocated by the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to recreate the appropriate sets and costumes to portray a "stunned Spain that chose the wrong leader to fight for and the fact that the fight for independence led people to a huge delay in development during the reign of Ferdinand VII" said Garci. 
However, the director regrets not having received equal funds of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than twice compared to Sangre de mayo. So far, it was not possible to shoot some scenes included in the plan, he himself had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, his career-long collaborator. 
The difference of budget influenced the usual way of working of the director of Volver a empezar: for example, the staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to rehearse before shooting together with the ones who do not belong to the cast, considering this "humiliating" and thinking that "the work of the director lies in going to the theatre and to the cinema to realize how the industry he is working for is going on." 
A certain number of interpreters, some of which fall within the cast of Sangre de mayo, repeat in front of his video-camera. It is the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo. 
Four times in the Oscar nominations - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three candidate films to represent Spain at Hollywood this year, his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés, and the Los selected ulitmo girasoles ciegos do represent the Spanish cinema's younger generation, "that should be known instead." 
Garci does not expect awards from this film. 
"At first you think of working for posterity, then you realize you only work for the prosperity, and at certain point you just shoot a film more," says Garcia after more 30 years of career. 
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the essence of the siviglian dancer Tortola Valencia 
A siviglian dancer pays tribute to another siviglian dancer. 
Carmen Valencia Tortola, father from Catalonia (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and mother from Andalusia (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana, and moved with her family to London when three. 
She was a ballet dancer and a free style and oriental dances' specialist. 
Her life was rather fascinating and she was a pioneer of women's emancipation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
She was Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the corset's abolition because it prevented women from moving freely. 
The life of this woman that marks a revolution in the aesthetics of dance in Europe between the two wars, had always fascinated Isabel Bayon. 
"I'd liked to work with Pepa Gamboa, and she proposed me to interpret this character. It seemed to me incredible." 
According to the dancer "we do not pretend to tell her whole life, but to collect her spirit. 
Her dances' titles suggested me some elements of flamenco. 
Thus, "la danza de la Mariposa" suggested me a guajira, or the "danza de la serpiente" some tangos. 
Her dance was sensual and I was told my way of dancing is part of this aesthetic, too" she says. 
The staging includes two outstanding contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of the shows, the same he did in "La puerta abierta", and the master Matilde Coral, which exceptionally wanted to work together with a former student of hers. 
"Matilde interprets Tortola in the adulthood, she is the character of maturity. 
I'm very happy she accepted to play in my work and I feel very honoured for this." 
The staging also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, singers as Miguel Ortega, Pulga y Moi of Morón and the percussion of El Pájaro, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal companion of artists like her, who were real round stars, and always had many lovers." 
This work also tell something of this woman's life because it was mainly held in distant places, particularly for her time, such as India, United States or Russia, as well as the whole Europe, using her to reside in London. 
"I wanted to remember her, because I think she was one of that women who had an enormous influence in a specific historical period. Nowadays nobody remembers of her and even considers her work as something of value" supports Bayon. 
The show will be on stage starting from today, 20.30pm, at the theatre Lope de Vega. 
The publication "Diario de un poeta recién casado" closes the 3 Years Anniversary's celebration 
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at Saint Stephen's Church(New York), the place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, falls within the plan made by the  Department of Culture of the Committee of Andalusia to celebrate the "3 Years Anniversary of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the allocation of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the death of both. 
So far, the "3 Years Anniversary of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" ends with the second edition of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, the restoration of the house-museum of the Nobel prized and the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chop de luz", which was inaugurated last May and, after having touched the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to be brought to New York in conjunction with the International Congress. 
In addition, the Department of Culture of the Committee of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Peter Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to promote and spread the figure and the works of one of the highest Andalusian poets. 
We like America a bit less without Paul Newman 
"Sometimes God creates perfect people. 
Paul Newman was one of those." 
The sentence is by Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the feeling of American cinema's impotence, and throughout America, facing the shock that Newman has gone. 
And awarding him with an Oscar had been quite hard. 
And in 2007 he had retired. 
And people also knew he was very ill. 
Although this, it was a very hard blow for all. 
"Sometimes your feelings go far beyond any word, and now I lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country improved quite a lot thanks to his existence." 
No one was afraid of result ridiculous or exaggerate. 
A father of the cinema and of the country had died in a particularly dark period, with the fear of terrorists and markets, with American people's self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking new reasons to feel worthy. 
When times are so difficult, men so less virtuous and with very few beings admired by people, you have not to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman. 
For all people he embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth. 
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and a supporter of lost and won causes, starting from the foundation to fight drugs he created in honour of the firstborn who died of overdoses until the promotion of a new brand for home-made and organic food. 
All gifts he did to a country which had to pay huge costs to go beyond a suicidal food culture. 
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, independently from nationality or passport. 
The latest James Bond, the English actor Daniel Craig, observed that this is not a dead man, it is an era which is over. 
Another English man, Sam Mendes, a director who won the Oscar, said that working with Newman was nothing less than the highest peak of his career. 
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, arrived to define Paul Newman as his biggest inspiration. 
"He left an example of the highest level for all of us," notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who try to live today as Paul Newman did: maintaining in high consideration the need for rectitude and having a serious private life, away from the cameras. 
This is not always easy or possible in contemporary media jungle. 
However, some people will try and Paul Newman will remain a very good example to get them inspired. 
After the divorce, his second marriage with Joanne Woodward lasted fifty years long, and he remained faithful having certainly opportunities for not being so. 
 "Why am I going out to have my hamburgers, when I can have a good steak at home?" used to joke himself. 
In the sky he is accompanied by the pride of his daughters who are also his fans on the earth, something not so common in America. 
"Of all the major roles he interpreted, none he was so proud of than that of devoted husband, loving father, attentive grandfather and passionate philanthropist" they say. 
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid 
Yes, the dream of many of us is that one day Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt in 2012, this could happen in 2016. 
But I wonder, are we ready? 
If we follow the example of yesterday race, I just say no! 
They called it the "perfect race" but in my opinion it was by far the worst I witnessed. 
All a nonsense, that if taken into account during the evaluation and I had to examine it, the output would be totally negative. 
But let's go with order and start from the very beginning. 
The nonsense began with the collection of the back number, which presupposed you went there before the race. 
It did not seem a bad idea, but if you're forced to go, it should be to withdraw all things (including the chip to avoid queues during the race). 
But this was not. 
We went there just to collect the back number (first nonsense, just go for this only reason) and (after the queue), surprise! they only had "S" size T-shirts (second nonsense, because I need an XL). 
What kind of world are we living in? 
Is it to blame the crisis if they bought only small T-shirts, made with smaller tissue and therefore less expensive? 
Well, these things were nothing if compared with the day of the race. 
We had to go very early to collect the chip but the queue was 15 minutes long and, furthermore, you had to deposit your backpack. 
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, something incomprehensible for a race where you expect more than 11,000 people. 
Then, as expected, the race started when we had not even handed over the backpack, although, once succeeded, the recovery was even worse. 
In addition, the rain threatened the waiting longer than 40 minutes, which went along with a kind of popular rebellion and an attempted assault to stand. 
I believe we will be around 500 people surely with pneumonia tomorrow, and some, like me, not even resulted in the proper arrival order because of the chip, which, I suppose, did not record the arrival time properly. 
In future, if I will be asked for the perfect race, this one wont't certainly enter in my thoughts. 
At the end of the day, I think we will continue to dream of an Olympic and well prepared city. 
Microsoft looks for a (virtual)receptionist 
During the conference on Emerging Technologies at the MIT, Microsoft presented a preview of the new recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without that much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as call a taxi (or, in the scenario described by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company's campus) "understanding" what happens in a standard conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and a forms and faces' recognition system, this "receptionist" may know how many people are there in a specific room, who are they – including remember what's their position - and listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them. 
It may also clustered people in groups of conversation. 
The demo showed that the receptionist notes a third person, understands he does not belong to the group he is talking with and that he is not a company's employee. 
It asks him if he's there to visit someone and says it will attend him as soon as possible. 
This without any awful blue screen. 
Awesome. 
But this is the future, of course. 
Now the company needs to focus on many other issues, such as the next Windows operating system's release. 
This week it was a big talk on Microsoft's change of strategy. 
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not be charged with so many programs. 
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers are equipped with the essential functions and less commercial rubbish, these should be five times faster - hey! Steve, will be for less. 
A real discovery, if one takes into account the fact that Microsoft, version after version has only added features and "extras" to Windows. 
The change of direction is very welcome. 
Microsoft is right: the operating system will be increasingly losing importance, and the software with it. 
When Google launched Chrome, I was one of those who supported the theory this was the first step Google made to compete with Windows. 
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system. 
The operating system will be always a necessity because it is the essential element through which hardware and software can communicate. 
It performs the same function of your wife or your husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law. 
It's true. 
It won't ever disappear, perhaps you just need to think about the "death" of the operating system as a relative event rather than as an absolute one. 
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea. 
People give less attention to the operating system, and increasingly focus on the browser. 
They only use the computer to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome - daily and spend a longer time browsing the web rather than working in a window environment. 
What half of the operating system's applications are there for? 
Less is more. 
And Windows 7 should be less, much less than Vista. 
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex. 
A Microsoft more interested in integrating its online services should constitute a viable alternative to Google. 
Actually, they desperately need it. Let's take a little example. 
I shot the photo of this post during the Microsoft employees' break, in Redmond, earlier this month. 
A sign, hanging on the soft drinks' machine suggested them to use the company's search engine - "Your search. Our Future". 
In 2006, an independent study reached the conclusion that the 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search on the net. 
Last week, moreover, Microsoft confirmed the delay in developing the new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
It will not be launched on the market at the beginning of 2009, but even at the end, maybe in 2010. 
Microsoft surely will try a joint launch, Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together. 
Our phones, at the very end, is increasingly becoming a computer. 
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on marketing, will result detrimental. 
The Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso used to dress it while in the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio shone with one of this in 'Diamante de sangre' by Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in 'The Godfather' of Francis Ford Coppola. Moreover, it is part of the typical uniform worn by the muscular gay parish. 
If we try to count the number of stars wearing it, we can also recall the image of the strong-built man with pointed mustache who lifted weights in the strolling circus. 
Finally, this is nothing more than the typical T-shirt for men, with a cotton interior, tight and sleeveless shape. 
It is the 'tank', as English speakers call it, though, the Brussels Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all. 
First of all, this is due to its grandiose name - even if it is commonly known just as "Marcel" - name that has something to do with the sport because it derives, according to the legend, from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, who loved the singer Edith Piaf. 
The "Marcel" excels - if compared to the others - for its high quality cotton, for its unisex cutting, for his distinctive little shield and the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable), which the most emblematic models keep as a detail on the neck. 
And open your eyes!, because the Belgian company does not produce only its famous "tank". 
The production also includes college sweats, vintage boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton trousers, sailor shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts... 
Garments meant to be comfortable. 
It is a pity to use them as underwear. 
They're too smart. 
"I want to be a young mother, doesn't matter the candidate" 
The great resemblance with her sister has not prevented her from developing a strong personality. 
Monica Cruz is a tiny woman, but still, full of vitality. 
Currently, both the Cruz sisters have taken very seriously their new activity in the fashion field. 
According to Monica, it is much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their names. 
She went to Paris for the campaign Mango is hanging on to promote the new branch, and the presentation of the most important prizes for fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house. 
Warm and timid, she conquers you quite quickly. 
Tell us what you're doing in Paris. 
I came here to present the new collection my sister Penelope and I have designed for the new Mango autumn-winter season, to join the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honour of Valentino. 
Let's say, a very intense day but a very exciting one, at the same time. 
What is the inspiration of your new collection for Mango in this fourth season of work for the Spanish fashion house? 
Both my sister that I like the cinema of the 50s and 60s. From there we get bigger inspirations. 
Then, I like to get lost in the city and look at how women dress, at the way they combine and mix their clothes. I do it quite frequently. 
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you? 
I think so, although at the very end, all merged and many elements remain cross-field ideas. 
I liked clothes since I was a child. I loved to visit my grandmother to rummage in my aunt's cupboards and discover her clothes. 
It was so good!, much better than going to the amusement park. 
Then, once a dancer, I always took great care of my dressing. 
It is known dancers really like to have their own style when going to class and dance recitals, to look themselves in the mirror and feel good. 
And in the actress role, when you are delivered the wardrobe, this is the time you actually encounter the character. 
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionals. 
Not long ago, you celebrated your 30 years, did you entered a crisis? 
Absolutely I didn't. 
I've never felt better, I like to be 30 years old. 
I find it is the age when women are mature enough and can take advantage of a good experience to enjoy life and commit fewer errors. 
I'm not scared by the biological clock. 
Since I was a child, I did all the things I liked to do and this gave me a great inner happiness. 
So, are you thinking of being mother or not? 
Yes, of course, I'm. I know it is my same body pushing me for this and also I want to be a young mom, I'm not gonna miss it. 
And about the candidate… Does not matter that much. 
I will give my son a lot of happiness and I will educate him with bigger love. 
Talking about cinema, you are waiting the release of some films you acted last year. 
That is, and I'm really curious about that. 
Coming from the theatrical experience, I am a very impatient and anxious woman, I want everything now and clearly, but I know this may not be always possible. 
I'm looking forward mainly for "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo". 
Let's see if you like it... 
Few days ago you debuted on the catwalk side by side with Naomi Campbell, didn't you? 
Well, don't put it this way. 
It's not I was on the catwalk as a professional model. 
Simply Naomi Campbell, whom I know since a long time, called and invited me to go to London and attend a charity fashion show for her organization "Women for a Better World". The clothes presented during the show - I brought two pieces from our collection for Mango - have been sold at auction to raise funds for this Naomi's NGO. 
People usually ignore this Naomi's tender heart. 
It is said so many things on her, that, knowing her quite well, I can assure you are not true. 
Moreover, I like to share and get involved in this good part of hers. 
She asked me to be shown for a noble cause, but if I had asked to play a pine, I would do it anyway. 
You cannot back out of helping the third world women. 
Drivers reticent of alcoholism should install the 'alcolock' 
The Interior Office wants the driver under three administrative penalties for excessive alcoholic rate, to install in their car a system that prevents driving the vehicle when drunk. The same if you do not blow into the measuring device. 
The measure was announced last June and has been already included in the Annual Report of the State Attorney General, according to which it will be a pilot project for a period of one year. 
This project's goal is the reinstatement of the driver, since he will need to attend a course of road re-education. 
The initiative is supported by the Attorney General for Road Safety, together with the General Directorate of Traffic(DGT) and the Technological Institute Foundation for Security in the Automobile(FITS). 
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers fined more than once for drunk driving, still drive a car. 
The 'alcolock' would avoid this, because the device, connected to the vehicle, measures the rate of alcohol in breath and prevents the driver from getting the car if he does not blow inside it, or in case it detects in the car an higher alcoholic concentration than permitted by law. 
The cost of the device, a bit more than 1000 euro, should be charged to the sanctioned. 
In this regard, a study conducted in 2007 in the United States proved that vehicles equipped with these devices can reduce the infringements up to 65% during the first year of introduction. 
And in Spain it was estimated it could save around 115 lives in one year. 
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: first of all to stop these behaviors before they turn into criminal offenses. 
And second, to facilitate the implementation of this practice, as the legal reform can be ordinarily made, but, on the contrary, the necessary reform of the criminal procedure requires to go through an organic law. 
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, even if it has already been introduced on an experimental basis in some trucks and public transports. 
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote a PSOE's initiative by which the party proposes to install the system in school buses, as has already been done in France. 
In Mexico, and without her peep-toes" 
In line with the British punctuality, at 17.40 pm, perfectly on schedule, the Spanish airline landed at the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez airport in Mexico City, bringing there the Prices of Asturias. 
The sunset was almost done but the sun's rays still forced you to use your hand as a visor to see the royal couple getting off the plane. 
The Spanish ambassador and other authorities stood at the foot of the ladder. 
A few hours before I had asked a taxi driver, along the street, if he knew that the Spanish princes were about visiting the city to formalize an official travel. 
- Ah, very good, so we cannot go to the airport and collect people in that time band... Is she from here or... 
 - No, no sir, she is Spanish, but lived in your country for a couple of years. 
- Ah, well... 
On the way round, the Mexican press perfectly knows who are the princes of Asturias and is aware of the importance of the travel. 
Many are those who wait for them at the airport's hangar, crowded together on the red carpet and closed to a military line composed by 27 navy soldiers offering the honour greeting. 
The prince appears smiling, with a navy blue dress, and she, the princess, hair in the wind, very sober, does not wear her "peep-toes" as usual. Perhaps she had been reported Mexico City is threatened by bad weather. 
They give photographers a smile and a brief stopover before moving to the room where the official group is looking forward to them. 
By the door of the hotel where they're going to stay, one of the biggest four in the city, a funny reporter of Mexican television waits for them. 
The best fashion award 
Probably there is not a more appropriate place in the world than Paris to present a fashion award, and probably there is not a living designer as exquisite as Valentino. 
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to support the international promotion of new talents in the fashion field. 
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros. 
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his drawings in the Mango's window at the number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann – Paris, and was almost crying for emotion. 
Moreover, the company's store is the second largest in Europe, recently opened on 1335 square meters' space. 
The most important one is located in London. 
The numerous events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino who chaired the jury of the contest, brought us to a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris. 
The proximity of the most exquisite paintings by Chagal made the presidential gala table prepared by Mango even more spectacular. 
Nati, with a broken heart and making a virtue of necessity, because of the recent death of her brother, wore a dress of the company and fashion complements by ELAH that took your breath away. So, arm in arm with her son Luis - a two meters height boy - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the tribute dinner she had organized. 
Andik, owner and master of Mango, welcomed the guests and as the gentleman he is, along with Baron Rotchil arrived at the end of the night without his jacket, because both had granted it to two ladies. 
Monica Cruz, who ran the shop in trousers and shirt - designed by herself – changed her dress for the dinner, wearing a very sensual long black dress. She got very excited when, during the night walk inside the opera house, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were shown the room for dance recitals, and recalling other times, she grabbed a bar and outlined a "grand plie". 
Inés Sastre did not join the walk inside the building, but before leaving, showed us her son's photos on her mobile phone. 
Next morning we welcomed the presence of Olivier Martinez - another boy who likes moving by motorbike - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel of Paris, bringing his own sheets, towels and only after asking to have no smells in his room. 
Stars under the starlit Paris sky. 
Oh là là, c'est la vie. 
1001, the number anti-stress 
It is not 1000 but 1000 and 1 the way to forget the chaotic and hectic everyday life. 
And if it seems not enough, all these ways have been collected in a book which will bring the relax to the bookstores by the 30th of September. 
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when ringing every morning at 7 o'clock, but the worst is imaging yourself involved in the frantic pace dictated by modern life. 
Office means tension, computer back pain. 
Stress is the illness of the twenty-first century. 
However, you are offered now neither one nor two ways to combat daily exhaustion and the struggle in taking a proper distance from the work's dimension, 
but no more no less than 1001 ways. 
Beyond yoga positions, the classic massage or the "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, a "menu" full of options tailored to individual tastes and needs. 
The anti-stress work is titled "1001 ways to relax" and will be available in the libraries thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK publishers. 
If someone believes winning the peace in areas such as business or personal relationships is not possible, this "manual" denies that belief. 
It also suggests alternatives, such as staying in touch with nature, or provides 100% natural recipes that help to relax. 
If the adrenaline is not already flowing in your veins to produce the balance of the body and stress has become a major problem for you, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and focus on reading. 
Speaking while sleeping 
Some children speak during the night. 
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something happened to them the day before, but those children who talk while asleep. 
The first time it happens, at most, you get scared, but it really does not have that much importance. 
This is a benign alteration of sleep, defined somniloquy. 
It is a quite common phenomenon, especially in children and adolescents. 
Certainly, most of you have been told talked in your sleep. 
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (just once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever) or on a more regular basis (every day, once a week, once in the month ...). The day after the child does not remember anything. 
There is not a single reason to explain the presence of somniloquy. 
Sometimes it should be linked to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, nocturnal enuresis (do pee in bed), or sleepwalking, but it is not necessarily the case. 
As mentioned above, it may be associated with stages of very high fever, in situations of stress or over excitement. 
In any case, this phenomenon is not researched that well. 
Even its intensity is extremely variable. 
It may happen a person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper, or the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches ...). 
In case the event is particularly intense, the child should be observed and possibly, a specialist should be consulted to check if the abnormal state of anxiety is due to any question, thus is generated by the child in order to vent his feelings. 
We said that this is a benign alteration, therefore there is not a specific treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders which, instead, can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or a situation of stress). 
What you can do instead is taking into consideration a number of very simple preventive measures, such as: 
Try not to over-excite the child before going to sleep. 
Propose calm games and avoid television programs or series that inspire fear or suggest violence. 
Very nervous children for whom relaxing is a very hard task, need you use relaxation techniques to help them acquire a certain inner calm. 
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully. 
Once somniloquy appears, try to keep calm. 
Remember that it is an inoffensive phenomenon for the child and that the next day he will not remember anything of it. 
Useful Tips 
Don't wake him up. 
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is going on, and you just interrupt his sleeping. 
Although he is talking, he is asleep and thus, he is resting. 
Remember that if he appears very anguished and the episodes have a certain frequency is better to consult a doctor or to verify from where such a great anxiety comes from. 
If you get what he is saying (which is not the most common situation) does not fall into temptation to make him an interrogation to obtain information. 
Do not get anything, because he is sleeping and he is not conscious to organize his thoughts. 
In addition, you are only able to hear what he says but you cannot see what he is dreaming about to say that things. Therefore, be very careful with any interpretation of the information you get and about the conclusions you might lead. 
Do not ever tell your child you could ask him something during the night to know his secrets. 
Not even jokingly. 
This can generate a huge anxiety. 
In short, do not worry, it's nothing serious, just an episode that lasts few minutes. 
Illhaeusern... finally 
Illhaeusern has finally regained its path to victory on its own soil after a long period of draught. 
Without playing a great match, the Yellow and Black have created the most occasions and managed to turn one of these into the match winner. 
The rhythm was not very steady during the match and the attackers found it hard to express themselves. 
After a first attempt by the guest captain Kauffmann who narrowly missed the goal from a far shot, Illhaeusern went on to take a slight lead and in turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn from high, Romain with the tip of his foot or again Diebold came to tickle the Dannemarie defence. 
At the front, there was a midfield block that allowed just the centre forward Riahi at the forefront of the attack. 
The beginning of the second half was decisive with the first two occasions dominated by Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, immediately after the score was opened for Illhaeuserns by Marais, well positioned to pick up a ball bounced off an initial attempt by Diebold (53'). 
But the Illhaeusern striker did not enjoy his success for long and was forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later, leaving his team-mates numerically inferior. 
But Dannemarie could not profit and could not cause any major problems to the Illhaeusern Eleven who just fell back a little to make its defence more "compact", except in the very last few seconds of the game where, after a big mess, the ball went very near the crosspiece. 
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen. 
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is going to make a trip to Brittany. 
Facing the display of force by the fishermen who on Monday had badly disturbed the access to several ports in Brittany and Normandy, on Tuesday morning at Guilvinec port, in Finistère, the president of the Republic has decided to yield and to meet their representatives. 
The latter have promised to accept "with a constructive spirit" and they hope he "will arrive with practical proposals". 
A presidential visit which occurs at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by fishermen in Brittany to come up with measures of addressing the soaring prices of oil, which peaked at an average of more than 1.14 Euro per litre. 
According to the Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be devised to help their enterprise to recover competitiveness and secure employment conditions and sailors' remuneration" 
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected with determination by the fishermen. 
On Tuesday morning, they conducted slow driving operations in the Morbihan and Calvados, causing traffic jams for almost 10 km. 
The leisure craft harbour of Quiberon was also blocked, but the roads to Belle-Isle were not blocked. 
A filtering roadblock was set up on the Quiberon peninsula. 
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning, since dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots at the port of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc. 
The movement has spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and on the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where trawlers remained docked at the quayside or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked any movement of any merchant ships. 
Fishermen in La Turballe and Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, in the evening stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery at Donges. 
Those at Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait until after the meeting at the ministry on Wednesday to decide on possible actions. 
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" has to decide on Tuesday whether to comply with the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris. 
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the officials of the National Committee of Fisheries, which did not support their movement. 
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give up" and "do not want to have to move onto Paris", for example, announced Liliane Cariou, president of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient. 
Professional fishermen, who pay no taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but believe that the threshold of profitability for a vessel is achieved with diesel fuel prices less than 0.30 Euro per litre . 
Paul Newman the Magnificent 
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died as a result of cancer at the age of 83, in his home in Connecticut. 
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes paid tribute to the cinema legend and devoted actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83. 
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast for 2008 
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is counting on 215 planes to be delivered this year despite threats of recession hanging over the global economy. 
The fourth largest global aircraft manufacturer, Embraer will maintain its delivery forecast for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, reaffirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, its chairman. 
In the first semester, the manufacturer has delivered 97 aircraft. 
The Brazilian manufacturer put a lot of hope on the Chinese market especially for its aircraft range of 30 to 120 seats. 
To date, Embraer delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years. 
AIG would cede more than 15% of its assets 
The International American Insurance Group, that the U.S. monetary authorities have refloated, plans to sell more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion that were advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times. 
AIG is ready to explore the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and its pension business in the United States, said the newspaper quoting sources close to the case. 
The administration board of AIG met on Sunday evening to consider possible cessations, according to the FT. 
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG. 
The assets which AIG plans to cede include its leasing subsidiary Air International Lease Financial Corp., its participation of 59% in the reinsured Transatlantic Holdings, and its property portfolio in addition to its private equity investments, the FT added. 
No final decision has been taken on these disposals, the FT continued. 
AIG must quickly find the funds to repay the loan of 85 billion that it has with the Federal Reserve or else risk seeing the U.S. authorities take 80% of its shares, diluting the proportion due to current shareholders. 
Analysis Paris Historical of the Meeting Morning Historic Morning Meeting 
The New York Stock Exchange showed a historical fall on Monday after the rejection by the House of Representatives of the Paulson plan to rescue the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen before approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10365.45 points. 
In terms of points, the biggest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. 
The Nasdaq index, mainly technological, has lost 199.61 points to 1983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to 1106.55 points, according to final closing figures. 
Already suffering a depression at the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street went down after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the rescue plan for banks that was to inject some stability in the markets. 
With 228 votes against and 205 for, the delegates have refused to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the resources he asked for. 
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan. 
"This is a bad signal for the market, which saw the Congress failing to adopt a plan, "said Lindsey Piegża of FTN Financial. 
"This shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added, fearing that a draft adopted in several days time can be "too late". 
"If the project is effectively dead (...) then the relay will be quickly passed to the Fed (i.e. the U.S. central bank) and other central banks to manage the crisis which would further tighten the credit conditions", predicted Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight. 
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "each day that passes sees the fall of another financial institution" in the United States, emphasised Mrs Piegża. 
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities have organized the takeover of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup. 
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, pushing for emergency interventions by banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets face "not only a crisis in U.S., but a global crisis", added the analyst from FTN Financial. 
The bond market has climbed sharply. 
The performance of 10-year Treasury bond fell to 3.632%, against  3.827% on Friday evening, and the 30-year bond to 4.161%, against 4.357% on the previous day. 
Obama, who won on points the first televised duel 
To the first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House has succeeded another to see who, John McCain or Barack Obama, won. 
Not surprisingly, the campaign headquarters of the Republicans and the Democrats have declared their own victory in the televised duel which was watched by a third of American families. 
The political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, though admirable, was not "brilliant" enough to enable it to reverse its decline in the polls five weeks from the presidential election. 
The Gallup, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gives a five points lead to Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), judges that the Democrats have pulled their own on Thursday. 
According to a CBS poll, among the undecided voters, who are those that count, Obama has won 39% of respondents, while 25% of them give victory to McCain. 
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his fellow candidate, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin. 
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her. 
She has good instincts nonetheless", warned Bill Clinton this weekend. 
The septuagenarian McCain has repeatedly put forward his unquestionable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "naivety" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this initial face-to-face debate. 
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that ..." he accused several times. 
"I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president," he also assured. 
An angle of attack hammered yesterday in Republican television advertisements. 
Obama, himself, has stressed that he represented the future. 
Without disassembling, he was concise and precise. 
He put forward his ability to make the right decisions and to restore the image of the United States in the world. 
"McCain has never understood, while Obama, if", argued this weekend, a Democratic spot criticizing the Republican of not taking the whole measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American on the streets". 
"During the ninety-ten minute debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday to 20 000 people assembled for an electoral meeting in North Carolina in the pouring rain. 
He did not even utter the words "middle class" or "workers". "The financial crisis clearly gives an advantage to Obama, who is considered by Americans as the most likely to save the economy on the brink of a precipice. 
"The coming week could be a turning point", estimated yesterday the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer. 
The Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an alumnus of the Clinton administration, compared the "good economic instincts" of Obama to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis. 
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis "is the final verdict of eight years of poor economic policies implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain". 
Reaffirming that he would still reduce the taxes of 95% of the Americans despite the turmoil on Wall Street, the senator from Illinois also reported that the achievement of the country's energy independence by promoting renewable energy was his first priority, together with the establishment of a system of health insurance. 
McCain, he wanted to build a cluster of 45 nuclear plants by 2030. 
Cautious, both candidates have dodged questions about the financial rescue plan of 700 billion dollars (470 billion Euro) adopted yesterday by Congress and extremely unpopular. 
In Minsk, "have you noticed that there was an election, have you?" 
Young people and other opponents demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the outcome of legislation. 
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening at the closing of polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent elections. 
While no results have as yet been announced, many young people came to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation." 
Some confess to not having even voted: "What for, since they will do whatever they want of my voice," said a youth. 
They do not believe that the regime which has made a good impression with foreign observers in order to resume discussions with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn. 
The sanctions, which include visa bans for 40 Belarusian officials and the freezing of assets, could be lifted if the elections are seen as appropriate by the observers. 
They have not been according to the opposition. 
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the count," lamented Yuri Potemkin, the spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties. 
"It's a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkevich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential and leader of the pro-European movement, because it's who counts the votes that is important, and here, that is the executive power. 
If opposition members enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected. 
But their entry into parliament could mean space on television, meetings in the regions, and proposed laws." 
The opposition should therefore enter the political game because "we must open a dialogue with the European Union. 
Because if our economy which is heavily in debt with Russia, enters into a crisis, and if we do not reform ourselves, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia. 
We want to be independent". 
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the electoral process, does not recognize the validity of the ballot. 
She stressed that the participation figures seem too high, and that the spread in voter turnout (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the vote to all sorts of manipulations. 
"Have you noticed that there was an election, have you? Queries the Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of two political prisoners released in August this year. 
There was nobody at the voting offices. 
And there will be a maximum of five opposition members in parliament, those who are most convenient to those in power." 
The silence of the night falls on October Square. 
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Committee welcomed their success. 
The interview - Blood becomes safe again 
Héma-Québec yesterday celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice, because Héma-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient suppliers of blood in the world. 
And most importantly, it has regained the confidence of the public who had been seriously shaken by the tainted blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s. 
As we know, national reserves managed by the blood transfusion service of the Canadian Red Cross had been infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C during the 1980s. 
Faced with this tragedy and public discontent, the Government of Canada established in February 1994 a public inquiry, headed by Justice Horace Krever, which aimed at shedding light on the circumstances which led to such a tragedy and making recommendations so that such a disaster never happens again. 
While Judge Krever delayed in filing his report, some provinces set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada. 
In Quebec, the committee Gélineau has fulfilled that mandate. 
In the wake of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and Canadian Blood Supply for all other provinces and the two territories. 
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began operations, only 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary. 
The situation was discouraging. 
By dint of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and field work during the years that followed, we have regained the confidence of the public", she says before proudly affirming that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Héma-Québec. 
Dr. Décary, nonetheless, thinks "confidence is something extremely fragile". 
From its inception on the 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle. 
At that time, there were in Europe with the outbreak of a number of cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, said he who has been holding the fort since its founding in 1998. 
"And we did not know at all if the disease could be transmitted through blood. 
It was then based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports according to which when we are uncertain and when a serious illness may result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death, one establishes an excluding action. 
In April 1999, the blood of people who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was refused. 
But a few years ago, it was demonstrated beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood. 
This episode has shown that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense." 
In 1999, on the market a technique appeared which was much more sensitive for HIV testing: the nucleic acid testing (NAT) allowed to detect directly in donated blood the virus itself rather than antibodies against the virus, which is what previous tests were based on. 
The TAN helped to shorten the silent period, which runs between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains. 
It was able to reduce that period to less than a week. 
Thus, it has substantially reduced the risk that some donors were infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them. 
These improvements have helped reduce the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion. 
Today, a person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV contaminated blood. 
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will be distributed before someone is infected with HIV. 
Since Héma-Quebec each year distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood product occurs. 
I believe that now we can feel at ease when receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recuperate our health", affirmed the CEO of Héma-Québec. 
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products. 
One never knows what disease will emerge in the system. 
As recently as last year, there appeared on the island of Reunion the Chikungunya virus which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood. 
We must be constantly vigilant, "continues Dr. Décary before emphasizing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide them in sufficient quantities. 
"The demand is increasing as the population ages. 
The treatments being more aggressive, patients often need to refill in red blood cells or platelets. 
The aging population also has consequences on the network of blood donors which includes an average of only 3% of Quebecers eligible to donate blood." 
Any healthy person, aged 18 and over fits the suitability criteria to give blood every 56 days, six times a year. 
On average, 14% of those offering their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled in a country where malaria is rife, they would be excluded for a period of one year. 
"With these 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals. 
The shortages are very rare. 
But we must renew the members of this network of donors as they get older and cannot donate their blood. 
It is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but even more so to retain them and encourage them to become regular donors. 
Life today runs so fast, there is rarely time to find an hour to donate one's blood", says Francine Décary miserably. 
With an annual budget of $ 297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns. 
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which manages also the only bank of placental blood in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord that was once regarded as biomedical waste is full of a rich blood stem cells which can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukaemia. 
" A few weeks ago, we celebrated the banking of the thousandth sample of placental cord blood and we expect to draw more than a thousand per year. 
We should start to propose transplants at the beginning of next year, "says Dr. Décary describing this program for collecting placental cord blood as very popular. 
"Many mothers are disappointed at not being able to access it" because Héma-Québec cannot afford to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec. 
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals 
The Montreal Impact has qualified for the semi-final round of the playoffs for the first division of USL, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 in total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive game of the series quarter-finals on total goals at the Saputo Stadium. 
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute on Thursday. 
After a first half with nothing but aimlessly going from one side to another, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the net of the Montreal formation. 
Roger Levesque was the only one to beat Matt Jordan for the Sounders. 
Recall that during the first game of the series rounds, on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle. 
The Impacts will have to measure up to the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-final. 
Saturday night at Minnesota, Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return match to win 4-3, but Whitecaps nevertheless acceded to the semi-final round 5-4 on total goals. 
Impact will face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today. 
In brief – Kovalev's victorious aim 
The Canadian number one trio is ready for the season. 
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack for a Canadian win of 3-2 in a shootout against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre. 
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec has raised two aides, and Kovalev has collected a pass in this win, the Habs' fourth in six preparatory games. 
Kovalev gained the victory by scoring the only goal of the shootout. 
"I am not yet ready, warned the Russian. 
I need another match to feel at ease." 
"He tried to do too much in the first period, Guy Carbonneau noted. 
But I think he appreciated the way the match ended. 
He had a nice ovation." 
Charest placed on the North 
The prime minister does not exclude calling for an election before the end of the year 
Once the general council of the Liberal Party finished, Jean Charest yesterday visited Jean-Talon, Quebec City, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to get elected in the by-election today. 
"Pushing the limits of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining within the broad outline of the term of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Levis yesterday. 
Behind him, during his speech, a kind of mill of images was projected. 
Rotating in a loop on three huge screens, were dramatic pictures of hydroelectric dams, mining developments, of Quebec seen through "Google Maps", maps, etc. 
Like the mass media during elections. 
Moreover, as a point to emphasise, the Prime Minister has refused to exclude that he might call elections this fall, although he pointed out that his schedule was very busy. 
The "North Plan" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labour with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario. 
Often mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the object of a presentation. 
The Prime Minister had however to explain why the North was "a jewel with an immense potential", but never given its due chance, investment money, or specific priority in future projects. 
At most, a few avenues that could be further developed: including hydropower, the forest, but most of the entire mining sector, boosted by growth in emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure. 
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds", according to Mr. Charest's list. 
This territory is twice the size of France", " it is here with us, it is in Quebec. 
Not only is it with us, but it's also us", he insisted, to better show this he solicited a national founding myth. 
The province has built much by its relationship with the North, he said: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James's Bay. 
"We, our future," he added after a theatrical pause contemplating the immense map behind him. 
The North, 70% of Quebec, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed", said the Prime Minister at the press briefing. 
"This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated. 
There is a border along which there has been no agreement for too long a time and, when the opportunity arises, I reiterate this position there on behalf of government", he said. 
Moreover, "with the climate changes, we must rethink our vision of the North", he declared, referring to the Northwest Passage, to be held open throughout the year due to melting ice. 
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers occupying the territory a duty. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, First Nations and Inuit? 
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful with regard to them and that the project would benefit them, especially to young people. 
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member Ungava PQ), have already started consultations with thirty communities. 
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoit Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place, started work. 
The Prime Minister has not excluded holding a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a time when "we give ourselves a common vision." 
Northern development would also be consistent with the principles of sustainable development. 
The North will be "coordinated, orderly and respectful of the environment", he promised. 
Jean Charest described this "vision" as continuous with that of the Liberal prime minister who preceded him. 
"As the Liberals who have preceded us, we have alternatively thought to transform challenges into opportunities for growth and development." 
This has been one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which was launched Friday by a grand cocktail party to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party. 
One of the resolutions proposed to rename the Central Beauharnois Dam in Adélard-Godbout. 
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa who made James Bay, our party has managed to forge the future", declared Jean Charest. 
In the press briefing, he invoked another reference, conservative as this, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963. 
Addressing the proposed hydroelectric dam of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr. Charest has stressed that it should become operational for 2012. 
"Between us, but I plan to be there," he told activists, eliciting from them a huge round of applause. 
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, has not ruled out the possibility of calling an election this fall, it is what the law permits him. 
He stressed that his schedule is filled up, notably by a mission to the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summit. 
The weekend's General Council provided the Liberal leader a platform containing the nationalists resolutions, notably some "constitutional aspirations" which passed through like a breeze: the PLQ in particular calls for the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec in the Constitution. 
It also wants Quebec to be able to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications and that they have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec. 
On the opposition side, the outline of the Northern Plan was received with scepticism. 
The PQ leader, Pauline Marois, has brought up again the policy development of Northern Quebec that the Landry government had launched in 2001. 
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came into power in 2003, had waived the application. 
Had it done so, "it would be more advanced today," commented Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (ballot which takes place today), Françoise Mercure. 
The ADQ has supported the adoption of the North Plan by the government. 
"But what is desired, is that it is not just for show", said the leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returned from vacation today. 
Letters - A country dishonoured 
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice" (oh irony) in the Harper cabinet, which allowed himself last summer to say that Louise Arbor was a "shame" for Canada. 
Thus casting opprobrium on the woman who led a struggle for justice and who deserves our admiration also speaks volumes about the entourage of the Prime Minister and on Stephen Harper himself. 
Here, we have before us a government that is the only one among all western countries involved, not to have repatriated its nationals locked in the concentration camp at Guantanamo. 
A government which ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the crimes for which he is charged. 
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, has gone back on his word and let languish in inhumane conditions a child soldier. 
The only one that relies on a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused. 
Remember, for the record, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, pleaded for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he receives a fair trial in Canada. 
This same government turns a blind eye to torture: little does it matter to it that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, doubtlessly forever, after so many years of abuses. 
One does not yet realise, but we are witnessing right now a creeping erosion of our rights, of our liberties, and our "democracy", this word that Harper continues to brandish and that sounds hollow in his mouth. 
Now comes the time when there are no more morals: one can bully, torture, arbitrarily detain a Canadian citizen at the whim of the head of a minor government so far (so what will happen so after 14 October ...). 
A number of voters believe they will find salvation in a party that advocates Virtue, Law, and Order: they do not see that this government has abandoned what was the reputation and dignity of our country. 
Shame, Mr. Toews, it is here, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere. 
Free opinion - The Orwellian speech Barrick Gold 
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, executive vice-president of the Canadian mining Barrick Gold. 
Following an Orwellian logic, it states that the largest gold company in the world brought a defamation suit of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without a penny in order to launch a "transparent public debate". 
While it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, especially in the cases of defamation, they do not seek to find the truth but to follow the law. 
Not surprisingly, this difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver. 
Since, for Barrick Gold, the best way for it to conduct a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to support a contrary position? 
Regardless of the trial's outcome, the authors and publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and fight, with very unequal resources, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of mining. 
The tactics, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants with the aim of imposing a settlement that silences the opposition and in addition frightens anyone who dares to think of reopening the issue. 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is before the public it should have presented its vision of the facts. 
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, the debates in Canada are normally through the exchange of ideas and not of baton thumps. 
Thus, it would have been sufficient for the mining company to open its books, records and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding independent research teams that could shed light on the issue. 
But Barrick Gold appears not to trust public opinion and rejected out of hand petitions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada. 
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can both call for a "public" debate while at the same time disregarding the views of that very same audience? 
In the world of the Vice-President, it seems that this word refers only to high priced lawyers and not to all Canadians: that is a rather narrow view of the concept. 
In a democracy, even the critics have the right to speak. 
What Barrick Gold does not - or will not - understand is that the public which supports the writers and publishers of Black Canada, does so primarily because it rejects its brutal mining methods. 
The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not as part of what many perceive as a prosecution-gag (continuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just moreover filed a notice against the authors of Black Canada demanding them to cease their use of the term ...). 
Beyond the Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the continuation of Barrick Gold is a direct attack against the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential for any democratic society. 
It denies, collectively, the right to quote from credible sources and debate on the facts and interpretations, which represents the very basis of intellectual work. 
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects unpalatable to the wealthy corporations in the world in a country like Canada, under penalty of repeated prosecution, who can do it? 
If Barrick Gold really wanted an open and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada. 
She has a right to reply. 
The academia, to which we belong, has long been managing the debates and disagreements, and resolving conflicts. 
Barrick Gold enormous pursuit clearly shows that, contrary to its claims, it did not want a transparent debate. 
It is a loss for academia, as well as for public debate in Canada, and it is time that governments put in place devices that limit such frivolous practices. 
Operation Save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans agree 
The Bush administration and leaders of Congress, both the Republicans and the Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 30s. 
The new version of the 700 billion U.S. dollars plan to curb the financial crisis that rocked Wall Street for months has yet to be ratified by both houses of Congress. 
In particular, it foresees: a better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure repayment of public money committed, new provisions to limit the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right to look at the salaries paid to executives of companies rescued. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, the chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative to the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, following a marathon two-day negotiations. 
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on the market," declared the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
"Everything has been done in order to shield the real economy and ordinary Americans from the current crisis on Wall Street," said the Democrat. 
"This is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," declared Republican Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations turned into a sprint in the final hours for fear of the effect another failure would cause on the mood of investors. 
The deadline we had given was the opening of the markets this morning. 
Associated late to the negotiations, the two American presidential candidates were rather supportive to the agreement, without failing, however, to express their dissatisfaction that one is compelled to reach this extreme. 
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has asked for the addition of certain provisions in the agreement, particularly those that enable owners to keep their homes and ones on the wages of leaders of enterprises rescued by the state. 
"When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to congratulate. 
But these measures are necessary, "he commented on the airwaves of American television. 
Asked by another channel whether he will vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, responded: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so." 
"The outline that I read [show] that this is something we will all have to digest and with which we can go forwards. 
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable", he said. 
The plan of 700 billion aims to buy with the money of taxpayers bad debts, assets at risk and unsellable U.S. financial institutions. 
It comes after a 14 month crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble which first led to the collapse of risky mortgages (subprime) before spreading to other forms of more widespread credit titles (PCAA) and leading to a freeze of liquidity and the stampede of banks and financial institutions. 
This is a group of elected Republicans who had derailed the first draft agreement last week. 
It is believed to have come out of this impasse ever since the Democrats have agreed that certain "toxic" shares of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased. 
To round off the corners for everyone in Congress, a provision has also been added stipulating that if the government had to take losses for five years because of this program, it could introduce new taxes to help recover its investment. 
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial tranche of 250 billion to which could be added another 100 billion if the President deems necessary. 
The other payment of 350 billion has to be endorsed by another vote of Congress. 
In exchange for its support, Washington will get stakes in the companies it has rescued, earning dividends in case of profits and that it can sell when the storm has passed. 
The federal government will be able to delay the proceedings on the seizure of housing attached to mortgage loans under this plan and to set limits to compensation and severance packages paid to executives of companies affected. 
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote in the House of Representatives today, and the Senate on Wednesday. 
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light. 
Voices have indeed continued to be raised against the project yesterday, both in the Republican camp as well as by the Democrats. 
"Obviously, Washington does not hear you," said while addressing his constituents the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Finance Committee of the House. 
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem. 
Yes, solutions do exist. 
But not ones that take advantage of taxpayers". 
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed "the Sceptics' Caucus", the Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but reaches the same conclusion. 
"Four hundred prominent professors of economics, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to tell us: one asks the Congress not to hurry and to examine carefully the way forward", he said yesterday. 
At the same time, Europe has once again demonstrated the global nature of the crisis. 
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries have announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion Euro (16.3 billion U.S.). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas has indicated that it would renounce acquiring its rival in full bankruptcy since it has lost 2 billion Euro (2.9 billion U.S.) in the risky mortgages crisis in the United States. 
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers. 
"This is not lost money, declared yesterday the Dutch Finance Minister, Wouter Bos. 
In return, we get the right to vote with the bank and some influence. 
It's just something that investors and households appreciate now that uncertain times are ahead." 
Meanwhile, across the Channel, the British government seems about to nationalize another bank hit by the financial crisis. 
According to the English press, the government to endorse all outstanding loans in the bank Bradford and Bingley, including more than 41 billion (75.5 billion U.S.) in real estate loans. 
The Spanish bank Santander has indicated yesterday that it will buy branches and customer accounts of the British bank. 
The Bradford and Bingley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, the British government will have to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an true icon 
His beauty and his blue eyes were for a long time his main asset, some would say his weakness. 
Did he free himself from this narcissistic mirror, this American actor with the charming smile? 
Yes and no. 
His modesty, his sensitivity and an abundance of talent would have also distanced him from the power register which gives birth to real sacred monsters. 
But what a great runner till the end! 
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, aged 83, as a result of lung cancer at his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema from the years of splendour. 
Less monumental than Brando, who he resembled and was a long time sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breaking of dramatic conventions. 
Mixed blood children are often magnificent. 
He was born in Ohio in 1925, from a Jewish German father and a mother of Hungarian origin. 
From these European roots were born the glorious faces of the American dream. 
Without an excessive ego, the ultimate mark of quality. 
Because in him is portrayed a country-loving self made man, a combatant in the Pacific War, wounded in combat, who in the early 50's studied drama at Yale and attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theatre, on television, soon after at the cinema. 
The same man who fought for civil rights was also the driver who ranked second in the 24 Hours Le Mans in 1979, doubled as a sex symbol, albeit a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward. 
Also disappearing with him are the shadowy areas of this secret star, discreet, committed, allergic to the scandals of show business, which have definitely not penetrated the enigma. 
An honest man in the noblest sense of the word. 
The disappearance of Paul Newman brought vertigo to moviegoers this weekend, while his major roles collide on the black screen of memories. 
More than half a century of a seventh American art which is constantly changing scrolls through him. 
Rushing back into memory are the charming cowboy in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on a Hot Tin Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958. 
Closer to us (1990), one evokes his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfil all its promises. 
So many other Paul Newman have passed into history. 
The boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (marked by hatred), Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean, taken after his death, which really launched Newman in 1956. 
This friendly crook in the most brilliant The Sting, Oscar for best film in 1973. 
Billiard player bitter and vengeful in the magnificent The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961), he took up again the character on his return in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, who in 1987 won him his only Oscar with nine nominations. 
This face throughout the ages, it was him. 
Him again. 
Eras jostle by through his journey. 
Young people know him mainly through the cult of Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team. 
His fans met him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen brothers. 
With a last role as the godfather of an Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was closed. 
Unlike several legends of the cinema who have dropped the trade early, Newman has remained in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its splendour and its concessions. 
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humour, "as a living challenge to "underplaying "judging his performances too supported. 
The profession has not always been easy with the beautiful Paul Newman to whom roles came for a long time easy as pie. 
He played though less often, in his first young roles, marginal characters: neurotics, alcoholics, bastards or desperate men, with his perfect traits reflecting the excesses and the rebellious. 
As director, Newman revealed a little known aspect of his modest real sensitivity. 
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (based on the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy. 
He lost his son Scott to an overdose to whom he dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, out of decency and sadness. 
Among the rain of tributes that fell on Newman yesterday, his great friend and former companion in arms Robert Redford (they played together in The Sting, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better." 
Generosity, love of life are the features of the vibrant actor just disappeared. 
Beyond his legendary career, also erased was a great activist for civil rights, ecology, the independent cinema, a protestor against the excesses of Hollywood. 
We saw his mug shots on a lot of jars of salad dressing, sauces, biscuits, and other foodstuffs, judging the process fairly tasteless, although a gag at the outset. 
Profits from these sales were nevertheless paid to his Foundation for children in difficulty. 
Newman, rather than sit on his myth, has remained committed until the end. 
He left his five daughters a letter containing these words: "Always and to the end, your father has been incredibly grateful for his good fortune. 
It has been a privilege being there." 
And a privilege for us to have followed the trail of such a lucid and generous American artist. 
A model citizen, in sum and in addition. 
What has been produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag and his companions? 
The conduct of the criminal prosecution of János Zuschlag and his companions will be started on 8th October. 
The politician and his companions have been accused of taking part continuously and on a professional basis in a fraud causing significant damages, as well as in other criminal activities, including forgery. 
According to the prosecution, they used the awarded tender funds for their own purposes and often certified the performance of tasks by fake invoices. 
The state and municipal funds - HUF 65 million in total - have been shared between the organization Fiatal Baloldal and other people. 
The methodology - which has been published by the investigating authority, too - was to use bills of costs with unreal performance in order to access the awarded tender funds. This way the associations never met the agreed undertakings. 
Most of the invoices were false according to the indictment. 
The invoice templates were acquired in the Józsefváros market and the round stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas. 
The selection of the companies in the name of which the bills were issued was completed on a trip in western Hungary, where János Zuschlag sent István Lados. 
According to the testimony of the latter one, he was ordered to select pensions and restaurants. 
He asked for the bill of his consumption at the specific place, and based on this invoice they prepared the invoices to be submitted to the tenders called for by institutes such as the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the Municipality of Budapest. 
These were submitted mainly by István Lados and his companion, András Őri, who was responsible for writing the reports required to qualify for the support. 
One of Lados's "study visits" was to a beer-house. 
According to the invoice dated 2003 and issued by Zuschlag and his companions, the establishment provided food for a group of 90 people, who were members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
However, as the director of the company states, the establishment does not even have the capacity to provide seats for such a great number of people. 
The invoice submitted in the summer of 2002 to the foundation called Jobb Jövőért - which was later renamed to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért - also contained several mistakes in its form and content. 
The bill was issued for the accommodation of 130 guests in a 3-room pension in Badacsonytomaj, which had the maximum capacity of providing place for ten people. 
The imaginative fillers of the invoices went also too far when they indicated Pigal Kft. in the documents. It is a company dealing with catering services but its accounting - according to the information provided to the accusation authority - did not even include the documents of the foundations Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá. 
Győző Farkas, director of the firm said to hvg.hu that when he was summoned and the invoices were shown to him, he recognised their false nature immediately. 
"The name and tax number of our company were placed incorrectly on the stamp." 
And he added that, moreover, the invoice had been issued for the accommodation of 100 persons in spite of the fact that they had only 11 rooms, which did not have the capacity for so many people. 
In addition, the bill included catering as well, though their restaurant had not been in function for long. 
The enthusiastic bill-makers were not aware of the fact that the Budapest-based travel agency that they selected organizes foreign tours only, thus the indicated Hungarian transport - as a service category - did not coincide with the invoice issuing practice of the firm. 
Furthermore, - as it has been discovered during the investigation - they also indicated VAT on the document in spite of the fact that the transport activities to foreign countries other than the European Union were exempt from VAT. 
The degree of VAT, which has been shown in four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the foundation Jobb Jövőért, was also incorrect since the service of the firm should have been increased by VAT of 15%, instead of the indicated 25%. Additionally, the employees of the hotel issued exclusively machine-made invoices, while the reviewed bills were manually prepared. 
The invoice-issuers made another mistake when they indicated road transport of goods as performed activity - turned out during the prosecution procedure. This activity was not included in the services carried out by the firm originally dealing with investment consulting. 
The fake nature of the bills issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont was disclosed due to formal deviations such as inappropriate billing format and forged stamp. 
Just like in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sportcamp of Kunfehértó, the representatives of which denied having issued the bills. 
The forgers did not even pay attention to the fact that the Nyíregyháza based HIB Kft. was under liquidation at the time (2001) when a group from Fiatal Városért Egyesület allegedly had lunch there. The insolvency practitioner denied having issued the document. 
Issued consciously 
The other group of the invoice-issuers consists of those having been aware of issuing fictitious invoices. 
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány issued an invoice of about four million forints for on the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták. This invoice was issued to the foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért. 
According to the indictment, the director of Collab Kft. was encouraged by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to prepare a fictitious invoice. 
Biogate Kft. - which is currently under liquidation - also cooperated with Zuschlag and his companions. In 2003 the company provided the foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with invoices of roughly HUF 5 million with no real economic activity behind. 
There was no cash flow either since the issued invoices were voided later, but the organizations forgot to indicate this in their documents. 
The next category of the firms having issued the invoices are those being linked to the defendants. 
A good example for this is Iván Kubatov, the delivery representative of the Ukrainian executive director of Delta Trió Kft. having its headquarters in Budapest, but not to be found there, which deals with fuel and vehicle trade. 
In October, November and December the company issued several invoices for selling computing devices, in a value of approximately HUF 18 million. 
According to the data of the investigation, these bills were purchased by the Kiskunhalas-based Cash Investment Kft., which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005. 
The executive director of the above-mentioned company was a Romanian man, to whom Iván Kubatov was supposed to forward the company documents between 2002 and 2005. 
According to our information, Kubatov admitted having issued bills to Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and received the amounts paid. 
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons, specifically at the request of Iván Kubatov. 
However, neither of these firms operated actually, which the defendant explained by lack of orders. 
Still, he could take advantage of these undertakings; for his request, attorney Zsolt Szente - who was responsible for preparing the company founding documents as well - issued invoices in the name of the mentioned firms for the associations being in connection with Zuschlag, namely for Atlasz and Y-Generáció. 
Kubatov provided 15 invoices for the organizations in the name of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, with a total value of HUF 14.2 million. 
According to the prosecution, 10% of the amount indicated on the invoices and the amount of VAT was the share of Kubatov. 
He even had Szi-Beri Bt. issue fictitious invoices which were used for the tender of Biztos Pont. 
In January 2006 Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted a tender to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), which is a non-profit organization of the socialist party. 
They were awarded HUF 500.000 each, but the amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender. 
In order to avoid the fraud being disclosed, they submitted the 5 fictitious invoices issued by Works Team Kft. to TMA. 
These invoices were found - during the searches - in Árpád Kemecsei's office located in the Ministry of Education. 
Some defendants are likely to confess about the process of the invoice production - as they did at the attorney's department, too. 
The most interesting part of the situation could be János Zuschlag's decision on disclosing his secrets. 
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and though he did promise to provide information on all areas of the case, he has not done so. 
The question is whether he is interested in fulfilling his promise or - in return for the reimbursement of most of the damage (50 million forints), the socialists have struck a deal with him and Zusi would rather take the rap. 
Or he might just have taken offence since his requests regarding the alleviation of the conditions of his detention - in other words his being placed under house arrest - kept falling upon deaf ears. 
While those who have committed the much more damaging and non-compensated economic criminal activities can walk freely in the streets or wait at their home for the end of the legal procedure being conducted against them, he does not have the opportunity to do that. 
The psychology of overbidding: what do we spend more money on? 
At an auction, the customers tend to spend more money on a product and overvalue it. 
The neurologist and economist researchers of New York University managed to disclose the neurological-economic basis of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behaviour. 
According to their study published in the periodical called Science, people don not want to lose in a competition like the auction of eBay, thus they rather pay an unrealistically high price. 
The research aimed at mapping the neurological scheme of this "game" with the help of experimental auctions. 
A group of volunteers was playing lottery and another group was taking part in an auction. In the meanwhile, the active brain area of the experimental persons was being examined by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 
The participants had the chance to gain money in both games but during the auction game - in which overbidding the other person plays a significant role - the complex called striatum, situated under the cerebral cortex, was coming into operation upon the person's defeat. 
This area of the brain - besides its other functions - plays role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system. 
Thus, according to the researchers, raising the price can be explained by the avoidance of the violent reaction of the striatum. 
In order to justify their theory, the economist members of the research group conducted financial researches as well. 
In this research three groups were making bids against someone, under various conditions. 
The control group was simply informed about the real value of the certain product and they made their bids. 
Another group got a promise of receiving an extra amount of 15 dollars in case of their victory. 
The third group was provided by 15 dollars before the auction but in case of defeat, they would lose this amount. 
As it seems, the only difference between the two groups was the emphasis of victory or defeat. 
Proving the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the group "playing for not losing money" were ready to make higher bids than the control group or the group "playing for gaining money". 
"These results cannot be deduced from any existing economic theory. 
The earlier theories explained the phenomenon experienced at auctions by the delight of victory and risk avoidance. 
It was the neurological imaging methods that helped us to dissolve the contradiction between the two theories in a way that we got to a third explanation at the end", said Andrew Schotter, professor of the economic faculty of New York University. 
Hepatitis: when shall we turn to a doctor? 
Approximately half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection. In Hungary, the chronic liver disease is mentioned among the main causes of mortality. 
Although the number of the Hungarians being infected by hepatitis can reach 100 000, only 7 000 of them are treated properly. The reason is that many times people are not aware of being infected. 
Hepatitis is a collective name of different infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses. 
Even though there are similarities in the symptoms, e.g. liver inflammation or jaundice, the nature of the pathogens and the caused diseases are different. 
Hepatitis viruses are transmitted in two main forms, depending on the type of the pathogens: hepatitis A and E travel through the alimentary tract (for example with infected food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and the other viruses are carried in blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal mucus, saliva). 
Those who travel a lot should protect themselves against viruses A and B by vaccination; but there is no vaccination against virus C. 
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear 2 or 3 weeks after having eaten the contaminated food; they are accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal problems, nausea. 
The next sign is jaundice appearing on the skin and in the white part of the eye. Additional symptoms are: light coloured faeces, dark urine. Recovery can take 2 or 3 weeks. 
Annually and worldwide, 1 million people die of the more serious type of the disease, hepatitis B, causing liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver. 
The main reason is that only an estimated one-tenth of the infected receive medical treatment. 
Hepatitis C can also lead to serious problems: it may result in cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer if it is not treated. 
Most of the infected are not even aware of their illness since the pathogens destroy the liver cells over a long time, thus in many cases the first symptoms emerge 20 or 30 years later. 
From this point, early prevention, especially regular screening tests have fundamental significance. 
In three groups this illness is experienced highly above the average: among people having received blood transfusion before 1991, drug-addicts and those having tattoos. 
Currently, the number of people infected by chronic hepatitis C is around 200 million worldwide. 
Since the disease can be recognized by routine laboratory testing, it is worth seeing a doctor if any symptoms of unknown origin are observed. 
In case of early recognition, the disease can be cured, the virus can be destroyed, thus infectivity ceases and the induction of cancer can be prevented. 
30 September is the World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by the organizations representing the infected. 
It aims to call attention to chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, the causes of its induction and the significance of early recognition. 
Does it hurt less if you believe in God? 
According to a recent research, religious belief can be used as a kind of pain killer, which could have eased the death of catholic martyrs as well. 
"The scientists of Oxford University carried out an interesting experiment about the influence of believing in God on the degree of people's sensitivity to pain", says the British Telegraph. 
Within the framework of this highly bizarre experiment 12 catholic believers and 12 atheists were given electric shock. In the meanwhile, all of them were studying a painting of Virgin Mary. 
The results showed that the practising Catholics were able to exclude most of their pain. 
Due to the brain scanning technology, it turned out that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation. 
This was the first experiment in a series of research, which besides academicians includes scientists, philosophers, theologians from different departments of the university. 
To be exact, a sparking object providing electric shock was attached to the left hand of the volunteers in the experiment. 
The researchers asked the experimental subjects to thoroughly study two paintings; Sassoferrato's Virgin Mary from the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci's Lady with an Ermine from the 15th century. 
The researchers expected that - seeing the picture of Virgin Mary - the believers would enter a sort of religious state of mind. Da Vinci's painting was selected because of its similar style and calming nature. 
The volunteers spent half an hour in an MRI scanner and received 20 electric shocks within four consecutive time periods, while they were looking at one of the above-mentioned paintings. 
The Catholics described the situation as "safe" and "protecting" which made them "relaxed and peaceful". 
12 percent less pain was reported while the experimental subjects were studying the religious painting - comparing to the feeling they experienced by the sight of Leonardo's work. 
According to psychologist Miguel Farias, taking part in the experiment himself, similar effect could be produced by any kind of painting having strong emotional influence on the certain person, even among atheists. It is all about finding the right picture. 
"We should find a photo of someone who they feel very positive about, like a mother or a father", says the psychologist. 
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the findings of the research. 
"Practising faith should change and often does change our personality", he added. 
After these great results the question now is how Leonardo's or another highly appreciated painter's picture of Madonna would influence the believers' pain regulation? 
Would the sight of a quality Virgin Mary bring even better results? 
You are what you share 
On its 10th birthday Google can admit: it is there in the people's pocket, as well as above their head, in the sky. Google knows where people go on vacation, what kind of medical consultations they visit and what they are interested in. 
In spite of all that, Eric Schmidt, a key person of the company is still not satisfied. 
On the other hand, the sceptics who bring it in parallel with Orwell's dreadful fantasy just cannot see the essence of web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that the main goal of Google was to collect further personal information about the users. It is necessary to maintain the Google founders' original aim, namely: "to create a system for all the information of the world", he added. 
According to the Google-chief, the company - after having subverted the entire world in the last 10 years - is still at the beginning of the road towards the ability of treating all the information. 
Answering the question concerning his plans for the next 5 years he said he would like to ensure that Google will be able to reply to questions like "What shall I do tomorrow?" , or "What type of jobs suit me best?". However, software cannot give the right answers to these seemingly simple questions since the available amount of user information is not sufficient. 
Not all Internet users are aware of the fact that the terms searched by them are recorded, as well as the IP address used for the search and the pages visited by them afterwards. 
Using the 2-year-old Personalized Search function, users can store their own surfing histories, they can review what they were looking for, what kind of links they clicked on before. In the long term, it can provide the users with personalized findings. The function called Recommendations will be based on the same logic: it will be able to offer us products and services by the help of the preferences provided and recorded earlier. 
"What happens if my personal data are used against me, if it is discovered what I do?", ask some of the users worrying about the information-monopoly of Google. 
It is usually the degree of the potential power represented by the company that generates counter reaction in the users, not sense of guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or rebellion against authority. 
Nevertheless, it has been confirmed that all the searched terms are recorded and - where appropriate - those can even be transferred to third parties. In such cases nothing protects the privacy of the Internet users. 
The best example for that is the concerted action against some Brazilian paedophiles; Google transferred the Brazilian government some information from one of its social networking pages, called Orkut. The data supplied helped the government identify several paedophiles. 
The users who were worrying about the invasion of personal privacy could relief back in May when Google - in association with the EEF electronic legal aid organization - successfully proved his right against the FBI: the court confirmed that under no point of the Constitution can the FBI oblige Google to provide any kind of, secretly asked information. 
(Nevertheless, - referring to the confirmation of the child protection law approved several years earlier - the federal government did manage to get access to 50 000 web addresses and 1 000 search terms. However, it could not acquire the individual users' search lists, nor a complete list of web pages and keywords covering a two-month period.) 
As it seems, there are controversial opinions on Google. It is attacked by those who fear of giving out their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life would be diminished by using the services provided by Google. Thus, they rather represent the resisting group of conservative multinational companies. 
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its wild oat including enthusiastic computer fans, activists, users in several countries consider them as the next generation of large companies, a "cool corporation", in contrast to their opinion about their rival, Microsoft, the creator of Windows and the conqueror of the world, in spite of the fact that the two companies fight for the same goal. 
One of the reasons for it can be that Google - unlike Microsoft - does not require identification name from its users and money for the applications. Furthermore, the open and continuously updated source code and programme package - comparing to the official software giant's practice - looks more available, youthful and cool. 
Or maybe it is because of the fact that geeks can precisely see the problematic relation between personal privilege and Internet, which is in accordance with the most frequently discussed key expression of the last few years, web 2.0. 
Web 2.0 is about a collaboration to intentionally leave traces about our computer activities and exploit the available communication channels. Though the degree of this act can be various, depending on the user, the main point is the same: we show ourselves to the world. 
An average young person can open a profile on various public pages such as Facebook or Xanga, they can even link them to other services like Twitter or the music list maker last.fm, then those can be connected to a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, users can create blogs that automatically update the recently uploaded photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa. 
We can read about several stories like this: the girl - checking the plenty of photos uploaded in the morning by common friends - finds out where her untrustworthy boyfriend spent his previous night. Or another one: an employee might lose his job just because he shared his opinion on the management in his blog. One consequence can be definitely drawn: the definition of privacy has been revalued. 
If someone lives an online life, they are what they show of themselves - this is the basic concept behind the behaviour of today's youth. 
If someone has something to keep secret or if someone simply just wants to bypass Google's monopoly, it is also possible (e.g. using Scroogle, which also applies the Google search system but purposely leaves no trace behind). 
The number of those intentionally not registering to social networking sites is significant. This way they can avoid being discovered, Google's online applications from text editor to image manager and newsreader can be replaced by alternative versions that are not in connection with huge server parks and not trying to create our best profile ever. 
General public is looking forward to seeing what is still hidden by Google. 
The company - with its value of USD 156 billion - is worth more than IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion). In addition, the advertising spaces of AdWords/AdSense threaten the income of advertising agencies and services introduced at ever-increasing speed cause Microsoft and several other software developers a serious headache. 
Nevertheless, critics can also find the disturbing counterpoints: the management completely rejected the employees' objection, which burst out because the fee of the company's kindergarten had been doubled. The daily canteen - the use of which had been allowed at any time and even several times - was also considered to be too costly by the management. However, all these are nothing compared to the fact that Google bowed before the Chinese government in 2006 and - according to their agreement - the company has filtered all search results that offend good taste or the interests of the Chinese regime. 
One of the internal regulations of the company says that new services shall not be advertised in advance, only when they are ready to be used. Still, the coming months and years will definitely have huge influence on the world: some people predict that the book and magazine scanning and archiving project of Google will soon reach such proportions that it will have to face the Supreme Court. Others have fear of the Health system, which has the capacity to build a complete health profile about us, including our previous medical findings, physicians and problems. 
Finally, the fact that Google is building up a genetic database can provide a perfect base material for the sci-fi writers of the next generation. Cory Doctorow's popular novel, Scroogled applies Orwell's style in the description of a future where a person can be pictured terrifyingly well only by using Google data. 
The murderer of two was assisted by two minors in hiding the traces in Ózd 
"The police interrogated two minors about the double homicide committed in Ózd. There are reasonable grounds for suspecting that they assisted the murderer in hiding the traces of the crime", says the spokesman of the main police station of Borsod County. 
The two young people admitted having committed the mentioned act, they are currently accused of aiding and abetting. 
The two minors - 2 girls, according to the information provided by MTI - answer to the charges at large. 
Aiding and abetting can be punished by a maximum of 5 years of imprisonment. 
The suspect of the double homicide committed in Ózd - a 23-year-old local man - was taken to preliminary custody on Sunday. 
He is accused of having committed premeditated homicide against several people, for the sake of gain. 
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old young man owed significant amount of money to a 53-year-old man. 
The suspect did not intend to pay back the debt, so he drew his creditor to a suburban establishment of Ózd last Wednesday, where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter. 
According to the information of MTI, the young man was determined to commit the crime, which is evidenced by the fact that he had previously hidden a gun at the premise for this purpose. 
The police is examining the gun and the conditions of the crime with the assistance of experts. 
The Warsaw Stock Exchange submitted a bid to buy the Prague Stock Exchange 
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered EUR 200 million - approximately 5 billion Czech korunas - for the 100% ownership of the Prague shares. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the bid that has been taken by the Polish, in spite of the fact that the Czech had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the group of potential owners of the Prague shares. 
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is state-owned. 
99 percent of the stakes are in the ownership of the Polish government, which plans to sell 60 percent of the papers during the next few months. 
According to E15, the Czech economic daily newspaper, the Polish have submitted the best bid for the Prague shares. 
On the basis of the information provided by the Czech newspapers, offers have been received from the transatlantic exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse. 
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange declared last week that - among those being interested in the Prague shares - the worst option was the Warsaw Stock Exchange, the selection of which would result the cessation of the Prague bourse. 
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange stakes is estimated 5 to 10 billion korunas by the market experts. 
On the basis of the agreement among the shareholders, 90 percent of the stakes could be purchased. 
The largest amount of shares is in the hand of the owner of the Patria Finance investment bank, having approximately 25 percent of the stakes. It is followed by the Ceská Sporitelna bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent. 
About the financial crisis from the view of European newspapers 
The leading European newspapers were describing the ever-deepening international financial crisis as "a second September 11th" in their Tuesday comments. 
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - says the Rome-based La Repubblica blamingly - the president was not even able to have his own party back up the hastily prepared bill which is supposed to find the way out of the depressing situation... 
It is not so much a new Pearl Harbor, as Warren Buffett billionaire investor described it, but rather a second September 11th. 
Some of the Madrid press also blame Washington for the situation. 
In the view of El Mundo, the collapse of the world economy is due to the lack of political leadership in the U.S. 
The American financial system is at a growing risk of collapse, which will make the whole world suffer. 
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, now - pursuant to the congressional vote - the threatening risk is if Washington does not provide any political tool to handle the crisis. 
World economy is hanging in the air - just at the time when one of the biggest transformation of capitalism is taking place. 
"The threat cannot be ignored any more", marks the Tages-Anzeiger from Geneva. 
Some countries are still able to provide a life-belt for the weakened financial institutions and can save those from bankruptcy by the money of the taxpayers. 
However, if further banks collapse, as in a domino-effect, neither the funds nor new improvisations will help. 
What we need in the long term is that the members of the European Union shall determine themselves to overcome their own national selfishness and centralize the control over the divided financial markets. 
"The aid distributed just on Monday among the ailing financial institutes was more than 100 billion euros", recalls the Vienna-based Der Standard, adding that the worries are getting to point out that, just like the Americans, the European taxpayers will also have to dig down into their pockets in order to remedy the situation. 
The EU has not paid special attention to the crisis so far, which is now sweeping through the old continent as a tsunami. 
It is not expected from the "savers" to wave 100 billion euros in their hands right at the beginning but it would be important to determine the situations when the taxpayers' money is necessary to be used in order to prevent a more serious damage. 
Intelligent car imitates the flying of a bumblebee 
What could be a better way to advance the development of crash prevention technology than to mimic nature's obstacle detectors? 
Let's examine bees, for instance! 
In a surprising project that is in progress at CEATEC in Japan, the bumblebee has given engineers at Nissan a strategic hint at how to design the next generation of crash-avoidance systems. 
Based on joint research with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C-type Biomimatic Car Robot Drive. It is a robotic micro-car that recreates bee characteristics with the goal of producing a system that prevents collisions altogether. 
"In flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which in fact closely resembles our safety shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi brand director of technology, PR, research and development. 
The compound structure of bees' eye plays a significant role, which makes the bees able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees. 
In order to recreate the function of a compound eye, the engineers came up with the idea of a laser range finder. 
This device detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to them and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is instantly translated into collision avoidance. 
It takes just a fraction of a second to detect an obstacle, and the car robot instantly changes direction mimicking the movements of a bee by turning its wheels at the angle needed to avoid a collision. 
One of the main differences from any current system is that the avoidance manoeuvre is totally instinctive. 
"If that was not so, then the car robot would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles," says Toshiyuki Andoh, manager of Nissan's Mobility Laboratory and principal engineer of the robot car project. 
It must react instinctively and instantly because this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner-most layer of the safety shield, a layer in which a crash is currently considered unavoidable. 
The whole process must mirror what a bee does to avoid other bees. 
It must happen within the blink of an eye. 
But unlike a bee, it cannot deviate upwards or downwards or diagonally, only in two dimensions and only in the direction that the wheels can turn. 
So in place of the infinite number of ways a bumblebee can avoid other bees, here only the rotation function, the acceleration and the deceleration have been applied as available means of collision avoidance. 
BR23C uses lithium-polymer accumulators that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which - compared to the lithium-ion version - assures longer lifetime. 
According to Andoh, what is important is the intelligent instinctive reaction, not the capability for data processing and storage. 
The device is supposed to process only a few inputs per second and react on them accordingly. 
There is no need for storing the inputs and reacting by the intuitive logic based on the previous manoeuvring data, so it allocates continuously only a few dozen kilobytes of memory. 
There is no need for gigabyte or megabyte size memory. 
This is the first step of developing the instant collision avoidance technology that, on the basis of Nissan's estimate, can be built into the series-produced cars within 10 years. 
If connecting the device to the GPS satellite navigation system, an additional application option can be worked out which can help to avoid road barriers while driving. 
A name granted to the expensive child 
The written version of the bill on the 700 billion dollar economic bailout package has been drawn up. The draft law, applicable in several instalments, aims to purchase bad banking loans. 
In the first round, half of the amount is planned to be spent. 
"During the further reconciliations having come to an end on Saturday night, East Coast time, the congressional leaders managed to agree on the debate of several days, which concerned the 700 billion dollar bailout package", the Reuters confirmed. 
"We have taken an important step forward", declared Nancy Pelosi, democratic chairwoman of the House of Representatives, adding that the only thing needed was to work out the written form of the agreement. 
The compromise on the package has been supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain as well. 
Referring to the results of the compromise, Henry Paulson, Secretary of the Treasury declared: the programme is going to work well and going to be efficient, but further steps are still to be taken. According to Pelosi, it is not about rescuing Wall Street but to turn the direction of the economy. 
The written form of the package has been published at 8 pm on Sunday, Washington time, at the opening time of the Asian markets (at 2 am in Central-Europe) but it did not cause much rising on the stock exchange market. 
The draft legislation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 will be put to the vote on Monday, first in the House of Representatives, secondly in the Senate. 
President George W. Bush talked to Pelosi on Saturday night, then the news on the agreement was welcomed in the White House as well. 
"We are satisfied with what we have reached during the night and we highly appreciate the efforts of the two parties in order to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy", declared Tony Fratto, spokesman of the White House. 
The programme differs from the proposal having been first submitted by the Bush-administration with the aim of spending the 700 billion dollars on purchasing low quality mortgage-backed securities. 
Now in the first round a maximum of 50 percent of the USD 700 billion can be used in a way that USD 250 billion shall instantly be spent since the Congress is expected to vote on the issue on Monday. One part of this amount will be spent on buying low quality mortgage-backed securities. An additional amount of USD 100 billion is still waiting for the president to decide how to be used. 
The programme will be supervised by a separate body with the involvement of the chairman of the Federal Reserve. 
On how to spend the rest of the 700 billion dollars will be decided by the Congress. 
Pursuant to the law, the Secretary of the Treasury is entitled to apply a combined tactic: it can buy bad loans, mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and other types of "poisonous" credits. 
The purchase can be realized on auctions or in a direct way, according to the Treasury. 
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the worrisome assets will be guaranteed by the Treasury and the companies will pay fees equivalent to the expected damages. 
Henry Paulson declared: pursuant to the law, the required assets are provided depending on the situation; it might be an aid of USD 700 billion urgently needed by the American financial system, due to either the widespread purchase of bad assets, or the insurance of those, or even the prevention of a system risk caused by the collapse of some significant financial institutes. 
"We will make the necessary arrangements in order to be ready for the implementation of the law, as soon as it has been signed", he added. 
The directors of the troubled banks waiting for state aid should count on that their severance - which is simply called golden parachute in the overseas slang - will be restricted by the government. 
The restriction of payments is introduced in certain cases only, limitations depend on the nature of the support provided by the Treasury. 
Restriction means that in case the Treasury purchases on auction, surtax is imposed on the golden parachute, unless the ruined bank director is sent to retirement. 
In the course of buying bad loans directly, the government will aggressively intervene in order to ensure that the amounts of managerial money are not exaggerated. 
It must be added that the existing golden parachute contracts will not be amended, restriction applies only to the new ones in order to encourage participation in the programme. 
"This is the first time in American history that legal restriction will be imposed regarding the remuneration of chief executive officers", commented House Financial Service Committee Chairman Barney Frank, of the Democratic Party. 
Besides, the government will be conferred with the right of holding acquisition, this way taxpayers' risk will reduce, since they might even profit from the issue as soon as both the economy and the rescued bank is recovered. 
The bill includes that the president is obliged to submit a proposal to the Congress within the next 5 years, which specifies how the expected losses will be returned to the taxpayers from the financial sector. 
Sceptics gave voice for their doubts regarding the plan on both sides, too. 
"This is not what American citizens expect from us, this will not protect taxpayers' dollars", stated Republican Representative Darrell Issa from California. 
His Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur declared the arrangements have been encouraged by the same people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street. 
Industrial prices keep growing 
"Industrial domestic sales prices of August 2008 rose by 0.1 percent as compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent in comparison with the figures of August 2007", KSH informs. 
In relation to the data of July 2008, industrial export sales prices were 1.1 percent higher. When compared to the same period of the previous year, however, the prices decreased by 3.9 percent. 
As a result of the domestic and export price changes, industrial producer prices went up by 0.7 percent compared to the previous month and by 3.2 percent in relation to the figures recorded one year earlier. 
Industrial domestic sales prices showed a growth of only 0.1 percent compared to the previous month. 
Domestic sales prices of the manufacturing industry increased only by 0.1 percent as well, in comparison to the figures of July. 
In August 2008 the biggest price increase was experienced in leather, footwear manufacturing industry (2.8 percent), due especially to the 4.6 percent price increase in bag and strap production as well as the 2.5 percent monthly price increase in footwear production. 
The higher price level of plastic and chemical materials are responsible for a significant monthly growth in the prices of the production of chemical materials and products (1.6 percent). 
The prices decreased in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), in the production of electric machineries, tools (0.9 percent) as well as - to a minimal extent - in wood processing (0.1 percent). 
The prices of paper production as well as of publishing and printing activities have not changed. 
In the other sectors of the manufacturing industry the recorded price increase was between 0.2 percent and 0.9 percent. 
The prices in electricity, gas, steam and water supply playing a significant role in the domestic industrial sales, rose by 0.3 percent, due mainly to the widely influencing gas price increase, which had been introduced by the authorities on 1st July. 
Comparing the figures of the last 12 months - considering the domestic sales of manufacturing sectors - the highest price increase (32.4 percent) was observed in crude oil processing. 
In the production of metal processing a price increase of 13.2 percent, in the field of food, beverage, tobacco production 11 percent growth was seen. 
Prices fell in clothes and textile articles production (2.5 percent) as well as in the production of electric machineries, apparatus (0.3 percent). 
The rate of price growth was observed between 0.6 percent and 9.1 percent in the rest of the manufacturing industries. 
Prices in the whole manufacturing industry increased by 10.2 percent during the last 12 months. 
Electricity, gas, steam and water supply prices exceeded the figures of the previous year by 18.7 percent. 
Considering domestic sales within the sectors of destination, the highest monthly growth rate of August (0.7 percent) was experienced in the sectors producing capital goods. 
Prices went up by 0.3 percent in the consumer goods industry, while in the energy sector and in the sectors producing for further use no changes have been observed in comparison with the previous month. 
In August 2008 the highest price growth took place in the energy sector and in the sectors producing for further use (16.8 percent). 
6.8 percent price increase was seen among the sectors producing consumer goods and 1.4 percent decrease in prices among those dealing with capital goods. 
Forint-based industrial export sales prices in August rose by 1.1 percent in comparison with the previous month and decreased by 3.9 percent related to the figures of the past twelve months. 
Our national currency weakened by 1.7 percent to the Euro, and by 7.1 percent to the dollar. The forint strengthened by 7.5 percent against the Euro, but it strengthened by 15.9 percent against the dollar as of August 2007. 
No Visa Needed to the US from Next Year? 
According to Kinga Göncz, there is a good chance that the American-Hungarian agreement on visa exemption will take effect around 12th January, said the foreign minister in Chicago, holding a speech before the leaders of the local Hungarians. 
She added that "everything depends on whether the electronic access control system will be employed overseas in time". 
She called attention to the fact that though there would be no entry permit in the new system, tourists will have to register before travel. 
The leader of the Hungarian diplomacy is having negotiations in Washington from today. 
She is meeting Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to whom she is giving the medal Middle Cross of the Decoration of Hungarian Republic with the Star and holding consultations with the foreign affairs consultants of the presidential candidates Barack Obama, Democratic Party and John McCain, Republican Party. 
Both Barack Obama and McCain support the bank rescue package 
Both Barack Obama and John McCain, presidential candidates of the two main American parties, confirmed on Sunday to back the government's 700 billion dollar bank rescue package, though there are politicians calling for the treasury secretary to resign. 
After several days of marathon negotiations, the congressional and government representatives announced at Sunday dawn: they have reached an agreement in principle on the bank rescue package. 
Wall Street crisis and the financial package aiming to render the frozen credit market have become central issues of the presidential campaign. 
Both Obama and McCain seem to act in a way to prove: he is more suitable than his competitor to lead the country out of the economic crisis. 
According to the latest surveys, due to the economic issues which have come into the foreground, Obama has gained some advantage again, while McCain's leading position - that he had acquired after the Republican convention, by having appointed Sarah Palin as vice-president - has now melted. 
Obama expressed his hope at a campaign gathering in Detroit regarding the fast congressional approval of the act on the 700 billion dollar package. 
He emphasized that the proposal included those consumer protection passages that he had supported, too. 
"We must act now, with responsibility (...) people's jobs, their savings, entire industries, the stabilization of the whole economy are the things that are threatened", he added in front of a crowd of 35 000 people. 
He did not miss the chance to describe McCain's economic concepts as outdated. 
McCain stated in his report given to ABC that "this is a situation that will take long for all of us to digest (...) but doing nothing is just cannot be afforded". 
The Republican senator declared that the proposal included the need to set up a committee supervising the treasury secretary and to restrict the severance of top leaders, it was him who had insisted on these issues. 
Obama said to CBS that McCain had played no essential role in the reconciliations, while he had been in daily contact with the secretary. 
Nancy Pelosi, chairwoman of the House of Representatives provided the information that the House of Representatives was expected to vote on the bill on Monday. 
News From The German Papers 
The right wing is untouched, only the voters of the group have become more self-conscious - Der Spiegel analyses the weak presence of CSU in Bavaria. 
Haider and his party are ready to govern Austria in order to avoid red-black coalition. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
Franz Walter analyses the causes of the CSU's dramatic defeat in his article The Bavarian revolution is eating up its parents, released in the Internet publication of the left wing news magazine. 
According to the popular political scientist, the erosion of CSU had began far before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over the office. 
Christian socialists were doing reforms in Bavaria for long decades - at the present these modern citizens are the ones who turn away. 
The beginning of a new era means a problem for all Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel as well. 
The defeat did not really surprise CSU but a whole process ended on Sunday, a process that had been likely to happen in the last 10 years: the cessation of the indisputable hegemony of a state party. 
Ten years ago, in 1998 CSU landed on 47.7 percent, the first time under 50 percent since the fifties. 
It happened again 3 years ago, during the Bundestag election 2005, namely in the oft-mentioned Stoiber era. 
The reason for it was the consistent modernization carried out by CSU in the province, which eats up its parents. 
Sociologists have predicted it for 40 years but concerning its speed they were wrong. Nevertheless, secularization, educational results, the settling of Germans from the Eastern and Northern part of the country to the developing regions of Bavaria could not remain without consequences on the CSU loyalty of the voters. 
Modernisation comes together with the growth of opportunities and it has its own political consequences. 
The right wing is untouched, only the voters of the group have become more self-conscious, critical and wilful. 
What is also remarkable is that during the last weeks, mainly classical civil groups were departing from CSU; people of the liberal professions, industrial workers, people with secondary school certificate, people with college or university degree. 
CSU support here has been diminished to below 40 percent. 
Die Presse (diepresse.com) 
"Who, with whom? Party chairmen are reserved considering coalition issues" is the title of the article in which the Vienna-based conservative daily newspaper is analyzing the confusing domestic political situation developed after the Austrian elections. 
SPÖ intends to negotiate with ÖVP. 
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ to intervene to its internal issues. 
BZÖ seems open to negotiate in all directions, the greens do not wish to reconcile on coalition yet. 
The election has already taken place, now everything is about the coalition; during the debate organized by the public television, there was hardly any chance to gain insight into the party leaders' cards. 
SPÖ Chairman Werner Faymann confirmed his willingness to negotiate with ÖVP. 
SPÖ would like to show that the cooperation of the two parties is possible - it does exist in some of the provinces as well as in social partnership. 
Faymann left the question of a coalition with Wilhelm Molter as vice-chancellor - currently ÖVP chairman - open. 
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course has been rejected. 
Turning towards this direction again is out of question. 
Molterer was cautious in handling red offers. 
According to him, the cooperation by no means will be successful in case Faymann tries to intervene to the internal issues of ÖVP. 
Whether choosing to remain opposition or entering a coalition is still an open question in the party, this issue has definitely to be discussed within ÖVP. 
BZÖ Chairman Jörg Haider repeatedly seemed to be open to all alternatives. 
"In order to prevent a red-black coalition, we are ready to undertake government responsibility", declared Haider. 
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty, segregation must be eliminated 
The European Equality Summit has been opened today in Paris, which is organized by France this year, representing the Presidency-in-office of the European Union. 
In her message that she addressed to the plenum, Lívia Járóka of Fidesz, Representative of the European People's Party called attention for the educational segregation since it is one of the most serious infringement affecting Roma children. Moreover, this is the largest barrier to their prosperity. 
The high level conference has been opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labor and Social Affairs and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities. 
Representatives of the governments, the European social partners and the most significant European legal aid organizations and NGOs from the field of equal opportunities were invited to have a seat on the conference. 
Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group in the EP - pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination experienced when applying for a job, Roma people are segregated from the labour market mainly because of their low educational qualification. 
"Most of the young Roma people do not have a secondary school qualification, and due to the low quality of the basic education only an insignificant part of them can obtain college or university degree". 
Járóka also emphasized that education, as a fundamental human right, plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights. 
Investing in the early education of Roma children can contribute to strengthening the economy of the European Union member states. 
According to the representative, it is necessary to inform the widest range of people - Roma and non-Roma people as well - about these interrelationships. 
The earlier a young Roma student starts attending school, the bigger their chances will be to become a productive member of the labour market; through the income and the taxes paid by them they would contribute to the national budget. 
"On grounds of the citizenship right applied in the European Union, the right of quality education must be ensured for Roma people and low quality, segregated education must be eliminated", added Lívia Járóka. 
She also said that in order to instantly accelerate the processes of school desegregation, it is necessary to guarantee an objective- and action-oriented cooperation within the European Union. To accomplish this goal, it is fundamental to properly enforce the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives. 
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation, unemployment must be eliminated, Roma children must be provided with the opportunities of democratic life so that they could contribute to the future of Europe as citizens with full rights", demanded Járóka. 
Within the framework of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", the European Equality Summit - first organized in Berlin last year and since then held on an annual basis - aims to provide a unique forum to promote the objectives of equal opportunities and anti-discrimination at European and member state level as well. 
CSU: Transition Grace Period 
Decision About Defeated Huber-Beckstein Duo At The End Of October 
Despite ignominious election failure heads have not rolled yet, personal issues are adjourned temporarily at the Bavarian CSU summits. 
President of the Party, Erwin Huber and State Prime Minister, Günther Beckstein may still keep their positions, the question is how long grace takes. 
The destiny of the tandem which have suffered a catastrophic 17 percent vote loss will be decided by the extraordinary party congress at the last weekend of October. 
However, members of the much criticized duo pictured: they do not insist on their seats by all means. 
With this they intended to appease the furious members of the fraction and the basis who were claiming personal consequence because of having lost clear majority one day after the "Bavarian tsunami". 
Five years ago the Christian Social Union - true, lead by Edmund Stoiber who had been at the top of his career at that time - had obtained 60.7 percent but now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, the party could reach 43.4 percent only. 
CSU had been "absolute ruler" in Bavaria presenting 18 percent of German GDP for 46 years. 
Although conservatives are still considered the most important party in the Southern province, which has key role for the Hungarian economy, they are definitely forced to form a coalition in the future. 
As one of the first signs of restructuring within the party, Huber's potential successor, Party Vice President and Federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer becomes member of the small exploratory team beginning investigative negotiations about a possible Munich-based government coalition with liberal FDP as well as with Free Voters representing right-wing values. 
Irony of fate is that Gabriele Pauli, whose intervention against Stoiber had been misused as a coup opportunity and later was handled roughly by the Huber-Beckstein duo, becomes member of the legislative assembly from the party list of Free Voters. 
Leaders of CSU are making efforts on stabilizing Beckstein in any way. 
Stoiber, who was staying in the background until now, will have an active role in the transition time, the ex-state prime minister and former CSU president claimed 28th September the darkest day of his political career. 
Huber made some bitter comments on CDU on Monday, according to him CSU would have deserved much more support from its fraternal party. 
Other CSU politicians think that the defeat is a warning to both CDU and Angela Merkel. 
After the Bundestag Election due in September 2009, Merkel cannot be chancellor, unless CSU, which was playing significant role in the 2005 national success, is rehabilitated through mutual efforts. 
According to the disappointed Merkel, the failure of CSU will not have a negative impact on the coalition government in Berlin. 
Although it is relative: the wounded CSU is not going to be easier to handle and the crisis of the social democrats is going to continue. 
SPD has achieved its weakest result with 18.6 percent in Bavaria since 1946. 
Lukashenko-Opposition: 110-0 
No opposition representative was elected to the Belarusian parliament during the Sunday's election. 
According to Russian observers, the reasons for this are the welfare and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, while Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) explains it as vote counting frauds. 
OSCE delegating 450 observers from 43 countries refuses to recognize the election. 
Although the 100 member legislation of the country of 10 million has been missing opposition for more than a decade, before the election yesterday joined forces of the opposition under the name of United Democratic Forces (UDF) had seriously expected that Lukashenko, who renewed his presidency for the fourth time during the controversial elections in 2006 after the amendments of the constitution, was going to "allow" presence of some opposition representatives in the parliament this time. 
Based on this, UDF desisted from the formerly considered boycott, too. 
The background of the expectations of the opposition was that the economically increasingly Russia-dependent Belarus - that had raised a loan to reduce the more and more expensive Russian gas import and agreed to Beltransgas owning gas pipelines crossing the country becoming Russian property - wished to improve its relations with the EU, where visa is not granted for Lukashenko and for a number of top politicians due to the Belarusian political system, which is considered anti-democratic. 
The fact that OSCE when having evaluated the election campaign rather focused on positive changes instead of deficiencies - like banning one third of the opposition candidates from taking part in the elections - indicated détente formerly. 
However, OESC's Monday minute sheet raised objections against the campaign during which opposition candidates were practically not allowed to appear in the media and especially opposition not being permitted to be present at the counting of votes. 
According to the opposition, improvement is still perceptible in the political system: political prisoners have been discharged and Minsk is inclined to confront with Moscow in a minor way by still not recognizing South Ossetia and Abkhazia which have seceded from Georgia, although Russia - forming a federal state with Belarus on paper - has already been considering the two territories independent for a month. 
"We have taken two steps ahead and one backwards, but the most important thing is that dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started", told Alexander Milinkevich to our paper. 
According to the opposition candidate of the presidential election of 2006, this dialogue needs to be maintained in spite of the fact that the "power has got afraid of allowing even one opposition member to enter the parliament of no weight". 
Seeing the results, the opposition does not plan protesting actions, rather aims to reach voters with its message about the importance of economic reforms. 
"We have much trouble with this of course, we have to print opposition newspapers in Russia, distribution is hindered by the local authorities, but I can still see that changes are favoured by more and more people, amongst the old, too", said Milinkevich referring to the fact that Lukashenko's regime, which considers the establishment of the social security as its most important result, is considered inappropriate even by pensioners who are officially most supported class of society of all. 
"Owing to the indebtedness of the country and the increase of trade deficit, the break-down of social security 'similar to dead silence' is a question of time", Milinkevich claimed. 
Russian observers described the elections as democratic, in contradiction to the opposition politician. 
Commonwealth of Independent States mission leader Sergei Lebedev told Russian news agency, Ria Novosti: "People believe in actions not words", so the lack of opposition is nothing else than the evidence of Belarusian voters' maturity. 
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work " 
It has never happened in all the history of the Chigi Palace that there were revolving doors at the employee entrance and exit. 
But as from today, a new measure starts against crafty skivers, against those who clock in and then go to the bar for a coffee during working hours. 
The novel anti-slackers measure has been presented today by the Public Administration Minister, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Office of the President of the Council, Mauro Masi. 
"The revolving doors – says Brunetta – are a tool for working better, with a higher productivity, higher presence and more services" specifies the minister. 
"Now a new season of responsibility and transparency opens. 
This is reformism", underlines again Brunetta. 
With the Chigi Palace, the installation in all the buildings of the Office of the President of the Council is complete. 
For Masi "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic viewpoint". 
There has been no opposition from the employees, assures the Secretary General: "It has been a process shared by the workers and everybody collaborated". 
To conclude, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and croissant. 
A word from Brunetta, who suggests, smiling, "a good cappuccino at seven is blessed". 
During a convention at the High School of Public Administration 
of Rome, the minister, afterwards, makes known that "in three months the absences, by public employees, due to sickness have reduced by 50%, that is 60 thousand more people at work in a year". 
And adds that it is necessary to make Public Administration more efficient. 
Italians, "whose wage dynamics – explains the minister – in the last 8–10 years have been double with respect to the private sector and far above the inflation rate". 
Meantime thousands of public employees have united to challenge the provisions set by the Brunetta decree adhering to the petition supported by Codacons. 
"While the minister for Civil Service today parades the figures regarding the reduced absenteeism at work due to sickness – the consumers' association writes – the population of ‘the industrious skivers' is continuously increasing. 
In fact, in Italy there are thousands of honest and productive public administration employees that have united to declare war on the illegitimate provisions within the decree". 
In particular, at the TAR the exclusion of additional economic benefits for infirmity incurred during work will be contested; the extension of the hours that a sick employee has to make himself available for control medical visits, and other aspects within the new provisions insisted on by the minister. 
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Prevention is crucial" 
Everyday, in Italy, at work 2500 accidents occur, 3 persons die and 27 remain permanently invalid. 
For 2007, INAIL data confirm that in fact work related deaths have been around 1200. 
Figures that witness the gravity of a phenomenon that remains one of the principal causes of death and causes almost double the deaths with respect to homicide. 
To recall the attention of institutions, social forces and information media to this dramatic issue, today Anmil is celebrating in all the Italian provinces the 58th National Day for Casualties of Accidents at Work, institutionalised onto the second Sunday of October. 
"The worrying data diffused by Anmil and the very same tragic current news confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at the workplace is", declares the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in his message to the president of Anmil, National Association of the Mutilated and Invalids at Work, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head of the State expresses his "deep appreciation of the constant associative efforts for prevention at the workplace, caring for injured workers, assistance of the casualties' families, and the sensitization of public opinion". 
"Naturally, an indignant ‘enough' has been raised, sincerely shared in front of tragedies that, due to their size, provoke an outcry by the media and the involvement of public opinion but everyday reality proposes dramatic cases, whose dynamics are even repetitive". 
Napolitano does not conceal that "undoubtedly there's also a resources problem: it's important to invest in training and information. 
A particular significance is assumed by the numerous initiatives promoted within the schools in raising awareness of the younger generation that face the work market. 
It's a duty to keep alive the awareness of the phenomenon, not give up to its serious social alarm, apply and improve the legislative provisions. 
On his part the president of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini has underlined "as the phenomenon of accidental deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, that offends the conscience of each and every one of us and imposes on all the institutions a decisive obligation towards urgently ending it". 
"Data regarding injuries at the workplace seem to signal a small positive trend, but this does not take away the fact that the number of accidental deaths is in any case impressive", remarked the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We do not want, in fact, that this ‘downturn trend' is translated into a reduced alertness, because it is just when the attention is reduced that tragedy explodes. 
"We believe that at a general level little is being done to oppose the phenomenon of industrial injury and the fight could be carried on through multiple actions. 
It is necessary, in our opinion, - underlined Mercandelli – to have more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the worker training, and this should start at school". 
"A greater effort is required – he added – with regards to the communication and sensitization of public opinion. 
But, above all, a greater sense of responsibility is required on behalf of employers in respect of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency". 
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of care benefit provided for casualties at work" and the "welfare drift which the system is taking in the last few years". 
"Hence, the objective is to restore to the worker the insurance guarantee – he added – so that the fate of those who are injured does not have to depend on spontaneous political actions or grants which are from time to time set out by legislators". 
Mp3 players under accusation, they put hearing at risk 
Listening to music at high volume for a prolonged period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players could cause permanent lesions to hearing. 
This is what a European Commission reports, which in a communication released in Brussels cites the advice given by the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) of the EU, published today. 
"From this scientific advice – the note reads – emerges that 5- 10 % of those that, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music using portable musical players weekly for more than an hour a day with the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability". 
"It worries me that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical players and cellular phones at very high volume may unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way", declares Meglena Kuneva. 
"From the scientific findings – carries on the EU spokesperson – a clear risk emerges and we have to react rapidly. 
What counts most, we need to sensitize consumers and make this information available to the public. 
Besides, in light of this scientific advice, we have to re-examine existent control systems to make sure that they are completely effective and kept up to date with new technology". 
Brussels had asked the independent scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the widespread use of portable musical players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate. 
"Scientists – concludes the EU executive – confirm that there are reasons for concern and the European Commission will now examine, together with member states and other interested parties, what measures can be taken to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise coming portable musical players and related equipment". 
Currently, a European security provision already exists which limits the noise level of portable musical players to 100 dB, but concerns regarding hearing damage caused by an excessive exposure to such noise sources, are increasing. 
It is possible to considerably limit the damage by resorting to solutions such as the reduction of level and duration of the noise exposure. 
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable musical players listen to music at high volume (>89 dB) for only 5 hours per week, they are already over the permissible maximum noise limits currently in place for the workplace. 
People who listen to music under such conditions for longer durations risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a 5 year period. 
This is the case for 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified to between 2.5 and 10 million people within the EU. 
Rome, Alemanno gives the go ahead to the Commission for the  Future of the Capital 
Today it starts, in March it concludes, in June the conclusions are drawn. 
This is the schedule set by the Campidoglio for the "Commission for the Future of the Capital", which has this morning taken up residence at its new premises behind the Caracalla Hot Springs. 
In six months, the president Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will set down the guidelines for Rome. 
Once the project has been concluded in March, the Municipal Board and Council will evaluate the analysis and projects, so that in June the strategic plan for Rome can be presented with the official stamp of the Campidoglio and the mayor Gianni Alemanno. 
"The commission is absolutely independent and all political opinions, social, and cultural are represented – underlines Alemanno – It should make proposals for a development plan of Rome on which the political executives, which are always the Municipal Board and Council, can rely. 
There is no superposition of roles but only the will to have a place where a big project for Rome can be drawn up. 
In March its job will be done and it will dissolve, because this experiment should have a precise deadline. 
In June – the mayor announces – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the Future of Rome Capital". 
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals. 
If the quality is there, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I'm sure there will be in Rome, then its contribution will be fundamental. 
Too often politics are overwhelmed by everyday administration and by emergencies that manifest themselves from time to time. 
On the contrary, we want to look further forwards and further ahead, with a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future. 
Furthermore, the mayor of Rome would like to point out that "this commission is neither a useless agency nor an unwieldy bureaucratic organisation: it's absolutely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a cent and it will serve to get reasoning and get involved the best minds that the Capital has to offer". 
For Alemanno, in fact, "it's essential to have a strategic reference plan, not closed or inflexible, to permit our city to do an authentic leap in quality, which it really needs, thinking with a united spirit of its future. 
A future that, specifies the Mayor of Rome "will not limit itself to the current municipal borders but will look further afield" not only with the view of a future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but "also with consideration to the role that Rome could and must perform as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean". 
Obama? The first anti-American President. Here is why? 
A famous American politician, who would like to pass off as independent, wrote: Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the US economy and had dealings (as he still does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam". 
Attacks on Obama increase right as the election date nears. 
A lady from Miami has written on the web: "This person is full of ambitions. 
Obama is being cheeky: he thinks he can win the highest position in a country which has had in total two governors and five senators that were black!". 
In reality, these are attacks that don't mean a lot: they are clearly racial attacks and do not answer the electors' question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; all of them say that Obama will win and by a wide margin. 
Even in this case there are those who speak from the heart and not from the head. 
A Mississippi newspaper, deep in the South of the United States, wrote an editorial: once inside the voting cabin we know well enough to whom the American patriot will give his vote. 
A side of the United States mentality that has been kept under wraps to the last, emerges. 
"Say whatever you like, afterwards we'll take care of where to put the cross, for Obama or for McCain". 
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will go away from America. 
Things that have never been said before now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain. 
However, in spite of all these arguments, the winning trump for the Democrats is George Bush. 
1500 people have been asked what have been the errors committed by Bush during his mandate? 89 per cent have answered: Iraq. 
America changes. 
In Vietnam this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home with its tail between its legs. 
In Iraq 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack up and leave. 
Yet, for the majority Iraq has been the weak point of Bush. 
Whoever takes up the place of George W. will have an enormous task to do. 
USA, the economic depression is being felt also by the journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. And many blame the internet, "killer" of the printed paper. 
Five hundred American journalists have been asked by PEW Research Centre what they think of the state of their profession and mental control as regards to the future. 
Well, nowadays journalists are almost all of them pessimistic regarding their future. 
Yet, to the information clerks, they have not openly declared to be less worried with respect to credibility. 
They don't feel as isolated as they used to. 
The problem for American journalists is the money, the money. 
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model. 
Furthermore the cuts carried out in the newsroom, the office where editors work to assemble the newspaper, are a big problem. 
It's a problem that needs to be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we do not want that traditional journalism as it is understood by the general public is substantially diminished. 
A clear but complex pessimism nowadays pervades American journalists. 
Six out of ten journalists of the printed press and senior executives are convinced that journalism at a national level is going down the wrong road. 
Within the local field the executive group is 65%. 
Printed against broadcast. 
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going. 
The major publishing houses are opening a passage for themselves towards the internet, by many seen as the "assassin" of the printed paper. 
The "economic pressure" that journalists have felt has increased up to 79%. 
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology hoping that it "will do some good" for their journalism. 
The biggest rift in American journalism nowadays is between those who manage the newsrooms – that is the directors – and the reporters who work for them. 
56% of managers at national level are certain that their reporters share their values, whilst at local level the percentage decreases to 23%. 
For some this has got to do with "job security". 
On a national level, 43% of the managers believe they will lose their jobs within 3 years. 
For journalists the figure is 30%. 
As for "job security" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America it varies on a day to day basis. 
Only 13% of journalists have a work contract. 
In an immense nation such as the USA, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journals, magazines, radio, TV, and internet employers offer whatever they want and hence it becomes a question of take it or leave it. 
Directors almost always receive huge salaries, while an editor may earn 10 thousand dollars a month, in addition to the pension and paid insurances. 
As for holiday, things get complicated: so many days the first year, so many days after the third to get to a total of 15 days after a certain number of years. 
But American journalists, by their own admission, fall frequently "ill" during the year. 
It's all a question of climate. 
UNIPOL: ROME TRIBUNAL, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS AT GROTTAFERRATA 
The president of the second penal section of the Rome tribunal, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the petition made by the estate agent, Danilo Coppola that had requested to be able to move from his home town, Grottaferrata, to an abode in Rome. 
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy within the scope of the inquiry on the counter-proposal regarding the Unipol-Bnl takeover. 
While on trial, last week, he obtained the release from house arrest transformed into an obligation to remain resident in Grottaferrata. 
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the estate agent could travel from the country town within the province to an abode within the capital. 
According to the tribunal, however, these trips (against which the PM has advised)would allow him to influence his company and to have access to the evidence that is used to charge him. 
The elite in danger 
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a couple of days back with the vote in the Chamber of Representatives against the rescue plan of 700 billion American dollars passed by the White House: a significant portion of Americans was, and still is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy. 
A confirmation was given by yesterday's New York Times when it reported that the current crisis is causing a split within the Republican Party, ever more divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, in favour of federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead conservative, hostile to"those in Washington» and to the financial world, especially strong within the Central and Southern states. 
The soul, to be exact, which has made itself overbearingly alive with the vote mentioned initially. 
The latter is but only one example of the changes, of the big changes, that the current economic earthquake perhaps heralds or allows to be perceived: not only in the United States but also in all the West and maybe not only here. 
Both in the USA as in Europe the crisis seems to act as a catalyst for phenomena which have been in incubation for some time and which in the new climate have solidified and are finally coming to light. 
The first of these phenomena is the bringing back up-to-date, the extraordinary re-launch, of the twin category state-sovereignty in relation to a sort of re-nationalisation of the economy. 
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis for the financial-banking institutions who have, indeed, strong ties with foreign countries, but which above all deal with the budgets of persons or families who live in a single nation, in a single state. 
This immediately creates a political problem for whoever is in government: and that is how to respond to the difficulties and the protests of those people and those families that, besides, also form the electorate. 
In other words the crisis appears to be economically worldwide but politically it is almost exclusively a national problem. 
Political internationalism appears to be substantially out of play or to not have a lot to say: the clear proof of this is given by the European Union that, divided as usual between the various interests and the diverse state strategies, cannot decide on a common political path. 
And so it is from the government of each single State that all wait for intervention, bailout and re-launching plans, new rules, and especially financial aid: since that when it comes to worst it is only the States that have financial resources, the mass of financial resources capable to try and fix things. 
And they possess likewise the necessary means, and the legitimate reasons to use them: two resources of incommensurable value, under certain circumstances, of which probably no market and no international organisation could ever dispose of in an analogous measure. 
This new emphasis that the crisis poses on the statal-national element is after all perfectly tuned with the ever increasing importance that the latest economic developments tend to attribute to a coefficient that is very closely connected to that element: territoriality. 
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the reign of the web, of a technology increasingly more sophisticated, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalised finance was by now destined to dominate the world, we became suddenly aware that our future had instead to deal in an ever increasing fashion with those things that are very little immaterial such as water, harvests, oil. 
Accidentally, all are items that can certainly be transported from one place to another but in any case are tied in an absolute fashion to a well defined space, to a territory. 
So that whoever finds himself to be the sovereign , surely holds more cards in his deck than he who isn't, than he who happens to live in a place without crops, oil, or water. 
I'm getting to the second novelty that however predicts a split. 
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably implies Politics, and hence Leadership. 
In this respect the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena. 
On the one hand the knowledge of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the demand for somebody who knows how to handle the situation. 
On the other hand a wave of discredit for existent leadership, an economic sort, revealed to be so inadequate and full of grey areas. 
And together something ever deeper and in a certain way disturbing: a discredit, an intolerance, an image of inadequacy, a sense of remoteness that tends to involve the entire ruling class of an ever-increasing number of Western countries. 
Rather, it appears to make its way further in vast sections of the population the conviction which before that their actions are the same ideas as of the social elite up till now in favour, their way of feeling and being, their culture in all accepted meanings of the word, to have had their day, and to always be more alien to the opinion of the majority. 
In other words, the call for leadership feeds underhandedly a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the managerial class and of the traditional political structures, that manifest itself in the sudden electoral"revolts» or abrupt twists in the collective moods in these last and latest times, from the conservative rise in Austria – Bavaria to the collapse of the labour consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps even the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it). 
One gets the impression that the traditional elite, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, some would say their formats, are finding it always more difficult to comprehend, and hence to represent, that which has been taking shape within the deepest layers of western societies and which the economic crisis is strengthening, augmenting, potentially agitating without restraint. 
In face of all this, talking about a"rebellion of the masses» as being the order of the day may be frankly exaggerated. 
But keeping one's eyes wide open, it is not for sure. 
Superglue to be able to walk on walls 
To defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future be able to walk up walls like Spiderman. 
It's the aim of various American research centres and now a team of four institutes has come very close. 
With an adhesive of only 2.5 cm squared the scientists have succeeded in gluing a body of 100 kilograms onto a vertical wall. 
Studying – The American magazine Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, of the Georgia Institute of Technology, and of the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The material invented by the team of scientists is an improvement on existent materials that utilise a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes. 
«The principle behind the glue could be imagined as being like a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti» explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists were inspired by the paws of geckoes, covered with microscopic bristles which succeed in assuring a perfect adhesion to the animal. 
The tests conducted on various materials such as glass, Teflon, and sandpaper have demonstrated that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the paws of this reptile and at the same time"comes off from walls easier» explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Engineering Faculty of the University of Dayton. 
WALK ON WALLS? -"This material could be useful as a temporary glue» adds Liming Dai. 
Perhaps for walking on walls just like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but the researchers are thinking of a less glamorous use such as the connections between electrical devices, because the carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and of electrical current. 
Other applications could be within the aerospace industry. 
For now, no superheroes. 
OTHER RESEARCH – Even Berkeley University, in California, is dedicating itself to the research of a new adhesive. 
In an article in the journal of the  American Chemical Society the Californian scientists have presented an adhesive composed of microfibers like hair that self-clean from the dust during movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adhesion. 
Drugs: Never with fruit juices. 
Be careful of grapefruit juice, orange juice, and apple juice. 
These drinks, especially consumed in summer because they are thirst quenching and rich in vitamins, if taken together with some lifesaving drugs may alter their absorption, amplifying or diminishing, depending on the case, their efficiency with consequences that may also be serious for health. 
Confirming the risks associated with the assumption of fruit juices whether they are pre-packaged or fresh with certain medicines is David Bailey, professor at the university of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia launches a new warning: a glass of grapefruit juice, orange juice, or apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of certain lifesaving drugs, nullifying their beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients. 
Grapefruit juice has already been accused because it was thought to be responsible for raising, up to levels thought to be toxic, the effects of some antirhythmic, antibiotic, tranquilising, antihistaminic, and neurological medicines. 
DRUGS AT RISK – The very same Italian Drug Agency had given the same advice in an information bill two years ago, alerting doctors and patients to not underestimate the dangers deriving from this mix and to pay attention as to what is drunk in cases when drugs are taken such as for example Diazepam or Methadone. 
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT JUICE – According to experts even orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit drugs. 
The list of active principles inhibited by grapefruit and other fruit juices is very long. 
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University of Milan:"Usually, such discoveries are immediately brought to the attention of the various international and national drug agencies that then change the information slips of medicines. 
Therefore, always read the explanatory notes of the medicines taken and if there is something that is not clear, do not be afraid to ask the doctor or chemist for clarifications» emphasised the expert from the Ansa Agency. 
The Nobel Prize for Economy to Paul Krugman 
The Nobel Prize for Economy goes to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on market models and on the localisation of economic activities. 
55 year old Krugman is a neo-Keynesian that teaches at Princeton University and he is a well-known leader writer of the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the major critics of the choices made in economy and foreign policy made by the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, in the days when Enron was going bankrupt, Krugman had forecasted in an editorial published on the New York Times that the second incident would have been more determining than the first, in terms of its consequences on the history of the United States. 
A prediction that started a fair number of disputes and that for years had been thrown in the economist's face, but has now been revealed to have been exact. 
«I am surprised and also a bit annoyed by the speed with which recollections of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom have disappeared from public attention», declared Krugman towards the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an"economist of great value», but also an orator with a"very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excesses in liberalism of the Bush administration». 
Open Office, here is the third edition of the"anti-Microsoft» package. 
Today sees the release of Openoffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite which aims at gaining more users, from domestic to home users, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative for the better known Microsoft Office. 
After a effort lasting for almost a year on behalf of volunteer developers, with SUN Microsystem supervising at their backs, the new Open Office is revealed to the general public with various novelties: to the welcome screen and to a revisited, less Spartan user interface, are added others more substantial such as native compatibility with the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO version standard. 
Attention was also placed on interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is capable of opening documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx). 
Interesting are some functions specific to some modules such as the one that allows for the reduction in size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example for sending them via email, or the possibility of importing a PDF file into the graphics module, maintaining the original appearance of the page. 
Always on the same track, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents, that join the standard graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor. 
Collaboration is one of the features within the applications that has been considerably improved: in the spreadsheet application several users can operate simultaneously, avoiding conflicts on the modifications, in the word processor, each users is assigned a commenting colour to improve recognition during revision. 
Some companies are also working on porting some of the functionalities of OpenOffice onto the Web (on the cloud), and during the next few weeks they should release the definitive product. 
The Italian version is available for download at the address http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version which has been available on mirror sites since Friday. 
Besides for Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system. 
On request the installation cd can be sent to your home or workplace. 
And if the gimmick of free could be a driving force for the diffusion into houses, it is in the business setting that Open Office is trying the big bet since it can already count on several projects realised within the public administration and schools. 
And there are even institutions that offer training services, consultancy, and assistance, ideal small to medium enterprises, which could create more business opportunities. 
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for onscreen typing corresponding to Word; Calc, the spreadsheet application aiming at substituting Excel; Impress, for presentations in emulation of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access is the application that consents working on databases; Draw, is the graphic module. 
The aim for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads, and considering that up till today we are at almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is probable that the predicted figure could even be exceeded. 
Even Kohl tested positive, it is the fourth case of doping 
A new case of positive testing during the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the team Gerolsteiner, third in classification and winner of the best grimpeur shirt. 
Reporting the news is the daily newspaper L'Equipe. 
The 26 year old Kohl is the fourth cyclist tested positive to Cera, the third generation EPO, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from the Gerolsteiner team. 
The analysis of the blood samples from Kohl form part of those performed within the last few weeks by the laboratories of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry. 
If the counter-analysis confirm the tests as positive to Cera, the Austrian will lose the third place at the Tour and faces the two-year canonical disqualification. 
Confirming the news of Kohl testing positive to the third generation Epo is the French anti-doping agency's chief, Pierre Bordry who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positive test results. 
The 26 year old Austrian had placed himself on the finalist podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the polka-dotted shirt of the best grimpeur. 
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK IS WONDERING, IS ITALY RACIST? 
Italy "from a country of emigrants has recently been transformed into a privileged destination for immigrants" reluctantly received. 
Is this transforming the ‘Belpaese' into a nation of racists? This is what is being questioned in a long article in the New York Times, which has dedicated a lengthy article to the debate on the theme of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre originally from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for having stolen a box of biscuits. 
This case proves what the New York Times calls the "northern paradox": the northern regions are simultaneously the areas where there is "most integration and most work" but also where there is "the highest anti-immigrant feelings in the country and the highest support for the Northern League". 
As a confirmation of the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants the NYT has also cited the incidents of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino, and Castel Volturno. 
Not only. 
Even the new legislation from the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is advanced as a paradigm of the change in climate in Italy. 
A trend that has been highlighted by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic "Giorgio Napolitano who meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinal has asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism". 
Students victims of high rents up to 900 Euro for a room 
The rent market for university students does not know crises. 
According to the latest investigation by SUNIA, the tenants' syndicate, renting a single room could cost a student up to 900 Euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome. 
"The phenomenon has now assumed a very serious trend; up to the point that entire bands of young people are excluded from the right to study due to the high cost of living which their families would have to sustain – explains the executive from the Research Office of SUNIA, Laura Mariani – in these cities the strong demand by the students has distorted the market so much as to start a process of general increase in rent even for residents". 
In the majority of cases the rent-offers contain a series of violations: freestyle contracts, unregistered, without rent limits, connected subleases. 
According to SUNIA special intervention is necessary that, through a revision of the taxes imposed, the prices could be cooled down. 
Looking at the details of the investigation, one can see that in Milan, for a bed-space in the Brianza zone, 450 Euro are required; for a single room one goes from a minimum of 650 (Black Band zone), to an average price of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine and Fiera), and on to a maximum of 900(Victoria zone). 
In Florence a bed-space costs on average 350/400 Euro, a room approximately 700. 
In Bologna, where the students concentrate themselves in the areas closest to the university, 250/280 Euro are required for a bed-space in a double room, and from 370 to 500 for a single. 
In Rome in the zone near the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) approximately 600 Euro is the asking price for a single room, 450 Euro for a bed-space in a double room. 
Slightly lower prices (550 Euro for a single room) in areas close to the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
Savings are only possible by moving to the suburbs: 300 Euro for a bed-space and 450 for a single in areas such as Prenestrina, Centocelle and similar places. 
In Naples 300/450 Euro are required for a bed-space, for a single room one spends 400 to 600 Euro, with the highest prices found in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas. 
In Bari for a bed-space 250/350 Euro are required, at least 350 for a single. 
In smaller cities the prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a higher impact on the local economy. 
In cities where renting to non-EU students is a more frequent phenomenon, such as Perugia, there is a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30 % of the rent price asked from foreign students with respect to that asked from Italian students. 
Goodbye old Cinema Paradiso, cities cancel historical theatres 
Historical cinematographic theatres close in favour of Multiplex. 
"A city without cinematographic theatres is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes". 
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore efficaciously photographs what is happening not only in the large Italian urban centres but also in provincial towns. 
The sidelining process of the cinemas, with the birth in the outskirts of large multi-hall theatres and the consequent death by consumption of the single-hall theatres within the central areas of the city, is one of those events that appears unavoidable and incontrovertible and also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime. 
Frequently, it is historical places which are full of memories that disappear,"it is as if a friend is lost, an acquaintance with whom we have shared the way and many memories», observes the director of New Cinema Paradise, the film that twenty years ago gave Tornatore the Oscar and the Grand Prize of the jury of Cannes, and which narrated the poem of a provincial hall and the nostalgia for a way of living the cinema which, perhaps, has been lost forever. 
The numbers provided by Anec, the main cinema-operators association, speak clearly: within the last five years 316 traditional style cinemas have closed shop, and the ones to pay the price were above all the theatres in the principal cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna, and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo. 
Among the regions most badly hit by the closures, Emilia-Romagna takes the lead with 82 single-hall cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44), and by Lombardy (41). 
And to demonstrate that the arrival of the multiplex is the most responsible for their disappearance, these are exactly the three Italian regions with the largest number of new multiplex cinemas registered: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna. 
«The Italian business has developed in an irrational way» observes Paolo Protti, Anec's president,"it's useful that new structures are built but it's also essential that the survival of existing ones is guaranteed, because once a theatre in a city closes, not all its patrons may be inclined to transfer to the multiplexes. 
Not to mention the missed allocation of funds in favour of operators: the previous debit by the state is of approximately 10 million Euro. 
It's disgraceful, from the ethical and from the moral point of view, that the government does not respect the existent laws. 
To sustain the sector between 16 and 18 million Euro a year are required». 
An interesting example is that of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned by the closures, has decided to take cover by signing a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote single-hall cinemas both in the historical centre as well as on the outskirts. 
Among the foreseen provisions there are tax relief measures in favour of operators and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: the spectators can enter in the traffic-limited zone and have special tariffs for road parking and in some car parks. 
«It's an initiative which I like» observes Giuseppe Tornatore" and hopes that other cities follow the example of Bologna by putting in action other measures. 
It's certain though, that to contrast the excessive power of the multiplex, traditional theatres have also to improve the sound and image quality, because the public nowadays is more demanding. 
The defence of traditional cinemas is a theme that for me has always been important: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my infancy and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to create "New Cinema Paradiso", on which I have already been thinking for the last 10 years. 
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinal in National Street both closed by now, there where I have experienced many shared emotions, I turn away so as not to see the posters blackened by the dust». 
Ties between politics and ‘ndrangheta arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro 
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was disposed towards conforming municipal interests with those of the Piromalli gang". 
The accusations that the magistrates of the Calabrese Anti-mafia Office direct against the mayor and the deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, who have been arrested this morning for external contest with mafia association, are very serious. 
Also arrested is Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and the public administration offices, and his nephew - a lawyer, namesake of the boss, already condemned for mafia-style criminal association, condemned to repay 10 million euro. 
"In contempt of all judicial and moral rules, and common sense", write the public prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed the will to pay consultancy fees to the lawyer Piromalli. 
"In this way, it was allowed for the gang – the judges write – to officially penetrate inside the municipality easing the already vast possibilities of controlling and directing the public administration". 
The president of the Calabrese local council Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local institutions and organised crime are numerous" within his region: "there are areas where mafia presence is stronger and more intense than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable. 
However, there are many local politicians who resist the pressure put on by the 'ndrangheta, heroes who remain clean". 
This morning's arrests follow those in July with which the police announced to have beheaded the Piromalli gang. 
At the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always for presumed conditioning between organised crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved from duties of administration of the municipality. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the mayor of UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been elected head of a centre-right coalition, after the May 2006 ballot. 
He made a scandal out of it when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council. 
He brought in cause the then vice-minister of the Interior Marco Minniti accusing him of having plotted everything for political motives, however the judges, in the arrest warrant signed this morning, have explained that the Piromalli gang had even arrived at asking for the variation of the A3 project. 
From the interceptions ordered on Dal Torrione, writes the public prosecution, has emerged " a willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group notoriously close to the Piromalli, aligning the choices of the public administration with the interests of the gang". 
When energy is born from the waves the big come into play 
It's an immense body, that occupies 70% of the planet's surface and now the big, international energy companies are discovering it. 
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources being eyed, and subjected to attempts of development, by colossi such as Chevron. 
The possibility of extracting energy from sea movement has been under study for a hundred years and in the 70's, coinciding with the first oil crisis, research was intensified. 
When the oil prices went down, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the appeals by the environmentalists and the new increases in oil prices have given impetus to the sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated that in 2007 15 percent of the world's electrical needs could be provided for by the exploitation of the seas' undulating motion. 
This amount would be double that currently produced by nuclear power stations. 
And then there would be the currents and the tides. 
Colossi on the attack. 
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 has signed an agreement to construct a plant in the north of Portugal. 
When the understanding was announced it looked like a revolutionary step. 
Two years on there are more companies betting on marine energy and among these, there are companies that have always been devoted to traditional energy. 
"Chevron is researching technologies for oceanic energy – a spokesperson for a company associated to the U.S. oil giant has declared to the economy daily Wall Street Journal – and is evaluating the possibility of collaborating with us". 
The cooperation in question regards the obtaining of a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, necessary to start a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska. 
This is a significant sign, especially if one considers that right in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has set in motion a plan for new drilling. 
Besides Chevron there are Verdant Power Inc. Of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey to travel the path of marine energy and the sums invested so far, even though they are not known in detail, indicate according to the observers an increasing interest. 
Technology to be made ready. 
Experts talk about a technology still in its infancy, marine energy does not put to rest all the doubts about its environmental impact. 
Till now the plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not appear to create big problems for the ecosystem. 
To produce energy on a large scale, however technologies with a higher environmental impact need to be implemented. 
And the choices are varied: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected between themselves. 
The thrust of the waves, which makes the buoys move up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floaters. 
The pressure turns a turbine which in its turn fuels a generator. 
The electricity is sent to shore through underwater cables. 
For now there are four plants of this kind being planned, waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could be used by a military installation. 
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a commercial centre and a parking lot using six underwater turbines in New York's East River. 
The water movement when there are the sea tides makes the fans of the turbines go round, creating a rotary motion that powers a generator. 
Verdant has said that it has a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorisations to benefit from the energy. 
After the waves, the tides. 
Particular interest, declare the people at the Electrical Energy Research Institute, is deserved at the moment by the potential of tides. 
Even though it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than the wind, the sun, or the waves, and so is more reliable as a source of energy. 
It's exactly on tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine, and Alaska, together with others that overlook the coast, have already invested 7.5 million dollars in 2008 and are foreseen investments of up to 35 million for 2009. 
Barack Obama becomes the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
The American president Barack Obama will fly into Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, the fourth American president in history to do so.
He will receive a diploma, medal and cheque for 1.4 million dollars for his exceptional efforts to improve global diplomacy and encourage international cooperation, amongst other things.
The head of the White House will be flying into the Norwegian city in the morning with his wife Michelle and will have a busy schedule.
First, he will visit the Nobel Institute, where he will have his first meeting with the five committee members who selected him from 172 people and 33 organisations.
The presidential couple then has a meeting scheduled with King Harald V and Queen Sonja of Norway.
Then, in the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a grand ceremony, at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth American president to be awarded the prize, and only the third to have received it while actually in office.
The White House has stated that, when he accepts the prize, Obama will speak about the war in Afghanistan.
The president does not want to skirt around this topic, as he realises that he is accepting the prize as a president whose country is currently at war in two countries.
A few days ago he stepped up the war effort by sending more troops to Afghanistan, something that his critics will be stressing.
At the ceremony, Obama will also be given a gold medal, a diploma, and a cheque for ten million Swedish krona (around 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate this money to charity, but hasn't decided which yet.
Their busy schedule will then take the president and his wife to a banquet, which will be attended by the Norwegian king and queen as well as the ministerial chairman and another 250 invited guests.
Obama has always been reticent in regards to his prize.
He has said, for example, that he feels that he does not wholly deserve it.
He has repeatedly said that the prize isn't for him, but for everyone who upholds the same values.
Right after hearing about it, he described it as a "challenge to take action."
Nature protection officers accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice police have accused the chairman of the Litoměřice Nature Protection Society civil association of blackmail.
Several times during the last year he appealed against certain building permit proceedings, and has then claimed money from investors for retracting the appeal, said Litoměřice police spokeswoman Alena Romová.
The chairman of the Litoměřice Nature Protection Society is Lubomír Studnička.
He is now under arrest and faces up to three years in prison.
Recycling containers don't smell so good in Brno
In Prague, normal people can sort their beverage bottles, and, in South Moravian, villages are recycling containers on every corner.
And in Brno?
There, it will take you a good few minutes to find the right sort of bin.
I don't mean to imply that garbage isn't sorted in Brno.
But it seems to me that considering we're the second largest city in the country, the authorities are not showing enough interest in this problem.
Brno is falling way behind in its garbage sorting, not only because people here can still only put paper, glass and plastic into these bins, but mostly because of the sheer lack of containers for this kind of waste.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle into a bin in the city centre?
It's a real art form, and you need time and steady nerves.
The only place we've managed to come across is on Moravské náměstí, opposite the Potrefená Husa.
No offence to Mr. Onderka and his colleagues, but it's really not good enough.
Not to mention that it's no easy task sorting garbage in other parts of the city.
Plenty of my friends don't bother sorting their garbage.
Out of laziness.
It's just too far to the bin, you see.
I don't blame them.
After a party, I offered to throw out a few glass and plastic bottles.
But, on Kounicova ulice, there were no coloured bins to be seen.
Luckily, on the way to the tram, I found the right place.
But it was overflowing with garbage.
Come on, this is the centre of Brno. Isn't it supposed to look good?
It should, but ecology and aesthetics don't seem to interest the Brno socialists much.
They prefer to buy the city a new hockey extra-league, which puts us to shame all over the country, instead of buying a few more containers and letting us sort other garbage for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad to see that, after browsing the net for a while, my assumptions are confirmed by official statistics.
Figures published by EKO-KOM show that Brno really is the worst off in the whole of South Moravia.
"Paroubek's" budget takes money for pensions and sick pay
The fact that the left gave extra money to the farmers and civil servants in the face of government opinion means that there might not be enough money in the budget to cover pensions, sick pay, or building society savings.
And also not enough for interest on the national debt or to cover international judicial disputes.
This will bring problems for whoever is in office in the latter half of next year, said the Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists raised interest rates for certain groups, they were relying on the fact that the government would loan money for susceptible expenses, pensions, and sick pay. "It's just a case of postponing the problem, laying a minefield," says Janota.
Higher interest has to be paid on loaned money, and, at some point, it has to be paid back.
The state does not have much choice where to find it.
If it doesn't reduce social benefits or the costs of running the state, it will have to increase taxes.
For all those that the left just handed out money to: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later, their children, too.
People don't have to worry about pensions or sick pay, where 1.8 billion has disappeared from the accounts; they'll get them.
Although, at the cost of the state falling deeper into debt – next year the treasury won't just be 163 billion short, but even more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will continue to increase at an ever faster rate, as will interest costs.
The state will need money to cover it, and it's no longer enough just to slightly bump up VATs or reduce maternity benefits, as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
As money has been diverted to several groups of voters, next year there will also be a shortage of five billion for building highways and railways.
These are mostly sections that have been tendered out and are half-finished and cannot be redesigned or made any cheaper.
At the most, conserve what isn't free too.
This means that delaying or halting thirty major building projects and money from European funds is also at risk, warns transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The ČSSD has suggested that the deficit be resolved Solomon-style – it should draw on ČEZ dividends, which are mostly state-owned, and use those to top up the transport fund.
The problem is that the level of these dividends is never certain, and they are certainly not a bottomless resource.
Last year, 18 billion of ČEZ money went into the budget.
Every year, these dividends are used to pay for clearing up ecological damage, topping up the pensions account, or are set aside as a reserve for the upcoming pension reforms.
Moreover, according to EU regulations, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP.
But this is not the end of these transfers.
The budget is almost three billion shot to cover various damages owed to the victims of communism and crime, to meet the cost of judicial disputes, and even to cover building society savings.
It is still not clear if the state can get by without this money.
It's a gamble.
If we were to lose an international dispute, we'd still have to pay, claims Janota.
The minister will then have to save money within the resort or, in the worst case scenario, reach into the government's budget reserve.
The two-billion-crown State Treasury project, which is already underway, is also lacking a hundred million, and what each office is spending can be followed on-line.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister can't find the money elsewhere, the project will have to be aborted and sanctions will be imposed, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will run two operating systems
The Americans are saying that, in the future, users will be able to switch between different operating systems on their mobile phones at the touch of a button.
The plans revealed so far look promising.
Just press one key and in just a few seconds you can switch from Windows Mobile to Android.
This is the goal of the American company Vmware, which primarily develops computer virtualisation software.
This will let you have two user profiles at once on the same phone.
You can switch between them or have one for work and one for home.
Both of them will run at the same time, says Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computer World magazine.
It was presented last November and first demonstrated just a few days ago.
It will go on sale in 2012.
The virtualisation of smartphones is not science fiction.
VMware has already given reporters a demonstration of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was a modified N800 with 128 MB of RAM, running Windows Mobile and Android at the same time.
The development of new mobile phone technology is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test smartphone virtualisation and the sets should reach customers sometime during 2012.
Lack of snow in mountains causes problems for hoteliers
It's not only Krkonoše ski-lift operators who are worried by these bare slopes.
The lack of snow is putting people off booking ski holidays in hotels and guest houses.
This means vacancies are still available in the Krkonoše throughout the winter, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We're getting plenty of visitors to our site.
People are browsing the offers, checking prices, but, so far, are worried about making a definite booking.
"When they call, the first thing they ask is if we think they'll see snow or mud," says Martin Jandura, who runs the Spindl.Info information web site.
Anyone who wants to spend New Year's Eve in Špindlerův Mlýn just how they want, had better start thinking about booking soon.
Those preferring to save money and go for cheaper accommodation can still give it a few days.
Hoteliers in Špindlerův Mlýn are so far just offering week-long stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they'll try to keep that up for a while, but even they will give in and offer shorter stays.
Then there'll be a sudden shortage of vacancies," estimates Jandura.
The Vrchlabí travel agency Ingtours is still offering vacancies throughout the winter.
What we’re interested in is Christmas week, which hasn't sold out yet.
Half of our capacity is still available.
That's why we've been preparing some cheaper last-minute Christmas breaks," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer New Year's Eve in the Krkonoše, but there are fewer vacancies.
Another good time for bookings is the first fortnight in February, although bookings for the remaining winter dates tend to be average.
This year, interest in winter breaks is low due to the fact that there is still no snow on the Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if any falls.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains when there's no snow.
If snow falls on the slopes this week, Christmas will sell out too," says Schiefert.
On the other hand, the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou has seen better bookings this year than last year.
We're up about 5 percent.
We have the last few vacancies for New Year's Eve and Christmas.
There's a lot of interest during the Polish holidays in January and we usually get plenty of bookings in February too," explains the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
The Omnia Hotel, by the central car park in Janské Lázně, is eighty-percent booked up for New Year's Eve.
Yet the newest hotel in Janské Lázně still has half its beds free for Christmas.
January this year has been a nice surprise, as we're already sixty-percent booked up.
So February isn't looking quite so good, but as soon as it snows, then interest in staying in the Krkonoše will definitely rise, says the owner of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
For now, however, the Krkonoše hoteliers will have to wait for heavier falls of snow.
Colder weather is forecast for Thursday, so if anything falls, it should be snow.
But it should get warmer again after that, said Jiří Jakubský of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute in Hradec.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It's almost funny to see how Barack Obama, reputedly the wisest president, is trying so hard in the matter of the Afghan war to repeat the strategy of his predecessor, having himself considered him to be the most foolish.
When he finally came out with his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it appeared that he had made a carbon copy of Bush's Iraq scenario three years earlier.
It's not just that in the text itself he repeatedly uses the words "just like in Iraq", but he even went as far as to use the name of Bush's declaration from January 2007 as the title of his own declaration:"The new way forward".
While three years ago he himself criticised Bush's idea to send fresh troops to help in the beleaguered civil war in Iraq as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which was recommended by his field commanders, was the only possible course of action and so successful that there are no reports in the news about Iraq.
It didn't help Bush's reputation, but in objective terms, it left his successor in a much more favourable position than might be expected.
Barack Obama hopes that, in Afghanistan, the miracle will repeat itself.
He was again asked to increase the military contingent by his field commanders, particularly the supreme commander of the Afghan operation General Stanley McChrystal, who even went against the custom of his subordinates to harshly criticise the reluctant gunners in the White House.
He asked for 40 thousand men to turn the situation around.
The president hesitated for three months, but failed to come up with anything better, and so at least the general did out of 10 thousand soldiers.
He managed to squeeze a promise out of Europe for another 5 thousand, even though he himself was originally counting on 10.
The trickiest aspect of Obama's strategy seems to be his plan to start pulling troops out of Afghanistan within 18 months and to finish the process within three years. Obama's doctrine as a whole calls for more questions than it answers.
Many doubt that this half-hearted increase will bear the same fruit as the action plan in Iraq.
Despite the internecine war of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively firm on its feet and its leaders have been honouring the treaties.
The Afghan situation is just the opposite - nobody can be relied upon and no treaties are being upheld.
In these conditions, it is hard for the Afghan security forces to prepare, being so used to changing leaders to suit themselves.
Political institutions, no matter how formally they might be set up, will be nothing more than a Potemkin village in which patriarchal tribal relations will run wild.
Balancing the interests of a variety of ethnic groups is unusually difficult due to the tricky relations between them, a fact which is further complicated by the influence of Pakistan and Iran.
Even building an "operational state", which is the most basic aim of the entire operation, does not seem particularly feasible.
The timing of Obama's strategy is foiled by his voluntarism.
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has just gotten worse and worse, and is now on the verge of exploding.
Only a truly romantic soul, totally unaffected by reality, could believe that the soldiers sent into the turmoil of this war for an "early return home" will bring about any miracles here.
From a political viewpoin,t it is pure irresponsibility setting a date for withdrawing the troops, as the Taliban will see it as indirect acknowledgement of an American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the European people to take part in the operations in Afghanistan is waning.
European politicians cannot and are unwilling to explain to voters what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor which could radically stir things up is what is going on around Iran.
If the situation continues to get worse and increased sanctions against Iran have no effect, the United States will face the difficult question of whether to try to resolve the situation using military force or not.
This will need answering when, according to Obama, America orders the victorious withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan.
Any such solution will obviously also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only saving grace for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three more years to the presidential elections, so there's still enough time for him to come up with another strategyif this one turns out to be a total whitewash.
Managers at Goldman Sachs no longer to receive cash bonuses
The top management of the American bank Goldman Sachs will not receive their bonuses in cash this year.
The announcement came from the company as a reaction to the harsh criticism of their salary policies.
Instead of money, the group of 30 top managers will receive shares, which cannot be sold for another five years.
The shares can also be confiscated if the managers take excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is leading the effort to link Wall Street bonuses with long-term performance.
I assume that Wall Street is well aware of the broader path it has to take, said former investment banker for JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachshas been targeted by critics since it set aside almost 17 billion dollars (almost 300 billion crowns) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
Reuters claims that the total bonuses awarded by the business this year, despite today's announcement, exceeds 20 billion dollars.
High bonuses in the banking sector, what with the economic crisis, have become a political hot potato.
On Wednesday, Britain announced that it had decided to charge a one-off fifty percent tax rate on bankers' bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds (around 712,000 CZK).
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women were awarded the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics
In Stockholm today, a record five women received Nobel Prizes from the Swedish king Carl XVI Gustaf in the professional categories and for literature.
In addition to four scientists, they also included the German writer Herta Müller, originally from Romania.
The Nobel Prize for medicine went to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their fellow countryman Jack Szostak, for their research in chromosomes.
The prize for chemistry was won by the Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for their work to clarify the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last award was the Nobel Prize for Economics, which went to the Americans Elinor Ostrom and Oliver Williamson for their analysis of economic management.
The only specialised category which nobody won this year was physics.
Today, this prize was won by the scientists Charles Kao, for his research in optical fibres, and George Smith and Willard Boyle, for inventing the CCD ship, which is the basis for all digital cameras, faxes, and astronomical telescopes.
All the winners received a diploma, the Nobel Medal, and a certificate for a monetary reward.
In each category, this award totals ten million Swedish krona (approximately 25 million CZK).
If there are multiple winners, they share the prize money between them.
Traditionally, the most highly-anticipated award, the Nobel Peace Prize, went to the American president Barack Obama in the Norwegian city of Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged that the award was controversial, as he is just starting out in office and, moreover, heads a country which is currently at war in two countries - Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defence of his policy he added, however, that these wars were essential in order to bring about peace, despite the high cost.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invites him to the Castle
On Friday morning, President Václav Klaus will meet with the finance minister Eduard Janota, who is considering resigning as he does not agree with the government's budget for next year as approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
It is assumed that the budget and also Janota's possible continuation in office will be the topic of Friday's meeting.
The budget has also been criticised by Klaus.
He claims the deficit is too high, which is worsening the public funding crisis.
The meeting was announced by the president's spokesman Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to discuss his future on Monday with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer.
According to the Budget Act, which Klaus is due to sign, the Czech Republic should get by with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
However, on Wednesday, the House approved the left's proposals to transfer funds, gave state employees a pay rise, and allocated extra money for social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government criticised the social democrats' proposals, saying that they will surreptitiously increase the budget deficit.
A bitter political dispute has broken out between the left on the one hand, and the government, Klaus, and the right on the other, leading to questions about the future of Fischer's interim government, which was agreed on in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as approved by the House, essentially does away with the package of saving measures put into effect by Fischer's government in autumn and which it believes should stop the state falling deeper into debt.
At a breakfast meeting with entrepreneurs today, Klaus, who is behind the state budget law but is not obliged to sign it, declared that politicians have long been neglecting a "serious problem," which is the "unsustainable deficit level" of public finances.
Now, he claims, there is no good solution to this.
The only thing that could improve the situation is a strong government which could fall back on the broader consensus of the political parties, the president says.
ODS chairman Mirek Topolánek said that it was a terrible budget and that the government should rethink continuing in office.
The vice-chairman of the ODS, Petr Nečas, told ČTK that the concept of an interim government supported by the ČSSD, ODS, and the Green Party is evidently no longer working.
In response to this, Premier Fischer described this statement as "strong words."
The head of the ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek by saying that what was terrible was the deficit in the budget prepared by the former Topolánek government for this year, which exceeds 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday the ČSSD declared the approval of next year's budget to be a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela played by Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's new film
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus will tell the world a lot about their country, its struggle and its victories, despite some people criticising the fact that the main roles are played by American actors.
It is a story about sport, race relations, and Nelson Mandela.
The life of the tireless fighter against the racist system of apartheid in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played by the Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he had asked ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could play him in Eastwood's film.
Another leading role in the film is played by Matt Damon.
I told him: 'If I'm going to play you, I'll need access to you".
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who won an Oscar for his role in Eastwood's boxing drama Million Dollar Baby, has already played roles such as the leader of the anti-slavery movement who eventually himself became a slave, a fictitious president of the USA, and even a god in Evan Almighty, but has only rarely portrayed someone who is still alive and means so much to people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his active role in ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and was then the country's president for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is Latin for 'unconquered' and is the name of a poem by the English writer William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like he does.
The film tells the true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unify the country. The newly-elected President Mandela knows that, after apartheid, his nation will still be racially and economically divided.
He believes that he can unite people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who, to the world, are outsiders.
The South African team eventually makes it through to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story onto the big screen.
My only aim was to play this role as realistically as possible, said Freeman.
Naturally, the greatest challenge was to speak like Mandela.
The actor said that if he and world politicians were in the same ball park, he would try to meet Mandela, go for dinner with him, and be behind the scenes with him before his speeches.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found out that when I take your hand, I draw on your energy, it flows into me, and I feel that I know how you are feeling, he said.
For me it's important to try and become a different person.
In the film, Matt Damon portrays François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, which was dominated by white players.
The actor said that he had six months in the tough world of rugby to prepare for the role.
It turned out to be a great surprise for him when he first met Pienaar at his home.
I remember ringing his doorbell, he opened it, and the very first thing I said to François Pienaar was: 'I look much bigger on the screen.'
Despite the evident differences in the stature of the actors compared to their real-life counterparts, under Eastwood's direction, Invictus has received positive reviews and there is even talk of an Oscar nomination.
The Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up the film by saying: "It was a great story, a very well-made film."
In the film reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has a 76 percent positive rating.
Secret of the glare over Norway solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
Strange lights of unknown origin have been seen over Norway.
Yesterday the Russian defence ministry finally admitted that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian border.
However, it was another unsuccessful launch and the missile, which is known as "Bulava" and should have been the pride and glory of the Russian army, has gradually turned into a nightmare for the Russian generals and Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence at tests on the rocket has not affected the success rate of the test flights.
The Bulava has generally not lifted off or has been damaged in the air.
The Russian newspapers are describing the "Bulava" as "the flightless rocket."
The rocket that doesn't fly but lights up
This, the 13th test, started off according to plan.
But near the end of the flight there was technical damage to the missile.
Apparently the engine blew up in the rocket's third phase.
This time, the "Bulava" was launched from the atomic submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which was cruising under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of rocket can be launched from a craft which is moving and even submerged.
This makes it likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the malfunctioning "Bulava."
Anyway, the Norwegians never had any doubts that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals are defending themselves this time though, claiming that it can't be described as a total failure.
The first two phases of the rocket went well, and the accident happened during the third stage.
Previously, the engines have always malfunctioned during the first phase.
Even though not one test launch has been completely error-free, the defence ministry consider only six out of the thirteen tests to have been failures.
The generals are optimistic about this almost fifty-percent success rate and keep insisting that the "Bulava" will eventually fly smoothly and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks weighing a total of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signs a year's contract with CSKA Moscow aged 51
The legendary defender Vjačeslav Fetisov will again play a professional ice-hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup holder will help out his team, CSKA Moscow, when they need him, and will evidently be playing in the fifth KHL duel against Saint Petersburg.
Fetisov, who retired at forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
Since Denis Kuljaš was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is training regularly and has agreed to help the team.
We just need to sort out a few formalities, the AP agency quoted the Moscow club coach Sergej Němčinov as saying.
It's not year clear whether or not the famous hockey player's comeback will be for just one match.
I think Fetisov is someone who can boost the morale of the other players, said Němčinov.
According to AP, if Fetisov returns to the ice, he will be the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played for Hartford for a whole season at the age of fifty-one and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet of Fetisov, Kasatonov, Makarov, Larionov, and Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players of all time.
In the Soviet Union uniform, he received two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship tiles, and triumphed in the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second half of his career, he also enjoyed success in the NHL, when wearing the Detroit uniform, he twice raised the Stanley Cup over his head.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai obliges unions. All overtime is cut
The management of the Hyundai car plant in Nošovice has agreed with the unions to cut all overtime.
It is because of all this forced overtime that the unions have declared a strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the Hyundai spokesman, Petr Vaněk.
The management, however, wants to come to an agreement with the trade union leaders for one Saturday shift this year.
We can't give up on our production plan, it's essential, so we have proposed voluntary overtime on Saturday December 19th, involving two shifts, said Vaněk.
The website Sedmička.cz wrote that the firm had offered all employees who are to work the Saturday shift a bonus of 400 CZK.
This bonus will also be paid retrospectively to those who worked on Saturday November 28th.
According to Vaněk, the firm has decided to change how it motivates its employees to take the proposed overtime.
Either they'll claim the additional wage for the overtime or they can take time off in lieu on December 28th and extend their Christmas holiday by one day, said Vaněk.
Additionally, all employees working the Saturday shift will have their travel expenses and lunch paid for.
Considering that overtime was the most pressing and thorny question for the unions, as well as for the protesting employees who brought production to such a grinding halt last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon to immediately cancel all overtime for December, said Vaněk.
Until last week, virtually every day the car plant workers had been forced to do two hours' overtime on top of their normal eight-hour shifts.
After signing the agreement, the trade unions will call off the strike
Further talks should be held between the car plant management and union leaders on Friday morning.
On Wednesday, the head of the unions, Petr Kuchař, said that if they came to an agreement on the demands and sign the document, they are willing to call off the strike.
The situation at the plant deteriorated sharply last Wednesday when some 400 workers held a spontaneous strike to protest against the incessant overtime.
They were also protesting against bad pay conditions and alleged persecution.
The management responded by saying that employees had to work overtime to meet the demand for cars.
In Monday's announcement of the strike, the unions also asked that no sanctions be imposed against the workers who halted production last Wednesday.
The trade unions are asking the firm to keep overtime to a minimum.
Moreover, this year they are requesting that a 5000 crown bonus be paid for this work.
The Hyundai car plant in Nošovice now employs 2000 people.
The firm began series production last November.
By this September, it had made around 80,000 cars, and its current capacity is 200,000 vehicles a year.
Czech discovery: a substance which works on 'tough' forms of the HIV virus
A team of Czech and German scientists has been testing a new compound which can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of this improved substance is that it also works on viruses which have become immune to medication.
In some cases, this outweighs the fact that the compound used for the normal form of the virus does not have such a strong effect as some drugs that are already available.
No cure has yet been found for AIDS.
Patients' lives can be greatly prolonged by a mixture of drugs which prevent the HIV virus from multiplying in the body.
However, they have a number of side-effects.
Moreover, if the propagation of the virus is not completely suppressed, it can lead to the development of resistant viruses, against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work being done by experts from three institutions, the Czech Academy of Sciences, VŠCHT Prague, and the University of Heidelberg, is opening up the way to deal with the rthe virus' resistance.
They have shown that substances known as metallacarboranes act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
Metallacarboranes are a compound of boron, hydrogen, carbon, and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way to all the other drugs in use today, and so they may get over the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists are coming up with new ‘improved’ compounds, prepared using knowledge of the molecular mechanism and its relation to the virus protein.
Metallacarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected to a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and hardy virus
The HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential to the life-cycle of the virus.
The mature infectious viral corpuscles would not occur if the HIV virus was not split by the HIV protease.
If we can stop the HIV protease, we will also stop the virus from spreading through the patient's body, the scientists explained in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of compounds in which there are two pairs of cages (see the diagram) connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
Somewhat weaker, but more reliable
The effectiveness of this series of substances against the HIV protease has been tested in a test-tube, as well as its effectiveness against the more immune(resistant) strain as acquired from patients infected with the HIV virus.
The effect of metallacarboranes on the normal strain of the enzyme is not as strong as that of drugs used in clinical practice, although their effect is not diminished against the resistant strains, whereas drugs currently used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of the effect and also of its other properties, such as its biological and chemical stability, low toxicity, and the possibility of making other chemical modifications, make metallacarboranes an interesting compound for future research aimed at suggesting new effective drugs to combat HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Structural Biology laboratory at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fall-out over the budget. ODS attacks Fischer, who defends himself
The head of the ODS, Mirek Topolánek, described the next year's approved budget as "terrible" and said that Premier Jan Fischer's government should seriously rethink its position in office.
The government chairman described the ODS statement as strong words.
Apparently he will take some time to think about it.
The vice-chairman of the ODS, Petr Nečas, said that the concept of an interim government supported by the ČSSD, ODS, and Green Party, was evidently no longer working.
According to Nečas, the government chairman must decide if he intends to fall back on the minority in the House as a fight against the growing deficit, or if he is to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approaches taken by the ODS and social democrats on the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed, remarked Nečas.
On Wednesday, the House accepted the budget for 2010, naturally with the left's proposed amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House gave extra money for the salaries of state employees, for social services, and for direct payments to farmers.
he government criticised the social democrats' proposals, saying that they will surreptitiously increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should get by with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
Before the vote, the ODS left the room, complying with the government's wishes that the amended budget is not as poor an option as the provisional budget.
Disappointment and futility
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his feeling of disappointment and futility, while Premier Jan Fischer said that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota were to really threaten to resign should the proposed amendments be accepted, the situation would look completely different.
According to Czech Television, Janota has made an appointment to see the Prime Minister on Monday after the session.
At the same time, he indicated that he was rethinking his position in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment in the budget talks.
If Fischer commits himself to continuing the fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the ČSSD appointees who carried through the budget amendments have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also clearly state that he will hand in his resignation if the House approves other laws that will increase the deficit, those relating to sick pay, pensions, or the amendment to the Civil Servants Act for example.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed to the ODS have committed no offence
This is a matter for the ministerial chairman Fischer and the government as a whole.
Ministers appointed to the ODS have done nothing wrong, stressed Topolánek in a text report from the USA.
He pointed out that several ministries employ people in under-secretary positions who support TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas emphasised that, if Fischer were to decide to resign on the principle of the fight against the public finances deficit, "it is totally logical and correct that he falls back on the left majority currently in the House."
But then he would not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the civil democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and I'll concentrate on that when the time comes, defence minister Martin Barták told reporters in the House, having been elected by the civil democrats.
This afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels to attend a European Council meeting.
ODS stands down at the request of the Prime Minister
Nečas also stressed that, on Wednesday in the House, the ODS would evidently have voted against the amended budget if the Prime Minister had not explicitly asked the civil democrats to allow the budget to be approved.
We don't look like orphans, we're not little children, was how he reacted to the question of whether the ODS was not hampered by the presence of the party chairman in the parliament and in the Czech Republic during the political negotiations regarding the budget.
I didn't notice that my vote was missing.
Back when I renounced my mandate, I knew that the following months would see the Bolshevisation of the House and the destruction of all that is positive, Topolánek himself responded.
The new Czech Railways timetable shows that fewer trains will be running for almost the same fares
From December 13th, Czech Railways will be cancelling or restricting some less frequented express and local trains, but will be adding more services to other lines.
As of the day the new timetable comes into force, there will be two percent fewer services in comparison with now.
Most fares, including basic and special tickets, will stay the same.
More links to the capital will be available, for example, to the people in the Ostrava region, as the railways are adding one Pendolino to that line.
However, the express will stop running to Bratislava.
There will be fewer express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice route, and the direct service from Prague - Letohrad will be cut dramatically.
The region planning the greatest transport cuts is the Region of Hradec Králové, with a total cut of eight percent, although Prague and the surrounding area can expect to see a rise.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also being cut, and several express services on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice route will be reduced to just a few days a week.
One of the greatest changes is the introduction of the new direct line from Milovice to Prague, since people now travelling from Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line in the Esko suburban system, which can now be opened since the track from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice has been fully electrified.
Long-distance services to the capital will end at the Prague Hlavní nádraží station.
Czech Railways is introducing more Pendolino routes between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run on two-hour intervals.
From December 13th, passengers will no longer be able to take Pendolino to Bratislava.
This year's cost of regional railways: 200 million more
Express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, and next year it will give the railways four billion crowns to cover demonstrable losses, the same amount as this year. Local trains are ordered by the regional authorities, who, next year, will pay out a total of eight billion crowns for them, while almost three billion will be contributed by the state.
This year, regional trains are costing 200 million more.
Czech Railways have concluded a new ten-year contract for local and express trains, whereas, previously, the contract was always for one year.
The railways have praised the system, despite the fact that the great majority of fares have not been increased.
The only changes are to ČD Net one-day network tickets and eLiška cheap internet tickets.
Travellers without a customer card will find that the ČD Net price has increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The eLiška price will now depend on the distance travelled, whereas, previously, it was a flat rate of 160 crowns to travel between any regional cities.
Filipino gunmen still holding more than 50 people, Children have been released
Today, gunmen in the south of the Philippines kidnapped 75 people, including several primary school students and their teachers.
This from the AFP agency, which originally announced only 65 abductees.
All 17 of the captured children, together with their teacher, were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping happened in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Around 19 gunmen are apparently using the hostages as a human shield in their escape from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to arrange the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the gunmen are part of the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police had originally been chasing the kidnappers following violence that occurred as accounts were settled between two local family clans.
In the province of Maguindanao, in the south of the Philippines, martial law has been declared due to the recent massacre which left 57 people dead.
The victims of the massacre on November 23rd, which was related to the elections for governor, included 30 reporters.
The governor of this southern Filipino province has been arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, together with his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family.
Muslim separatists are also active on Mindanao.
But on Tuesday, these separatists renewed peace talks with the Filipino government.
The story of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Invictus by Clint Eastwood will hit American cinemas, depicting part of the life of the former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous opponent of apartheid is taken on by Morgan Freeman, who was apparently chosen years ago by Mandela himself for his talent.
The supporting male role of the legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar is played by Matt Damon.
With the film in cinemas critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18th, 1918 in Mvez, in South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993 received the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
There were great expectations, as he appeared in public at a time when not only was South Africa busy preparing for the football world championship, but the media was also rife with worrying news about increasing racial hatred and discrimination by the black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the response to the new film has so far been generally positive in South Africa, despite the number of objections to "brat-pack" Hollywood stars being cast in the main roles.
However, despite what he says, Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I had dreamt about this role for many years and prepared for it well.
I met Nelson Mandela many times to, as they say, draw on his energy, he said in an interview after the film's grand premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good that we can commemorate Mandela and his mission in a film.
It is a story about South Africa, but it affects everybody, he added.
In the national rugby team uniform
The film, based on the book by the British writer John Carlin, entitled Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation, portrays the South African human rights activist during his first presidential election campaign.
In the film, Morgan Freeman tries to unite the two races and the populations that had so long been segregated and, like Nelson Mandela did in 1995, appears in the film in the South African national rugby uniform at the world cup match, which was won by South Africa.
For appearing in the kit, which is an almost sacred symbol in South Africa, fourteen years ago, Mandela received a standing ovation from the predominantly white spectators and gained the esteem of the white people.
Perhaps a football championship can actually bring people together as one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only black person on the national team.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve is only now becoming apparent.
White South Africans, however, are sceptical, as rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to go to Britain, admitted in a recent interview for LN.
The championship begins on June 11th, 2010.
Transformer worth tens of millions of crowns burns in Louny region
In the morning, a fire broke out in a transformer owned by Čeps at the switching station in the village of Výškov, near Louny.
Six fire engines came out to fight the fire, said the spokesman for the Ústí regional firefighters, Lukáš Marvan.
Originally, the firefighters wanted to let the transformer burn, but later changed their minds and are putting the fire out using a mix of water, foam, and special fire-suppression agents.
The fire was caused by a technical fault, a short circuit inside the transformer.
Nobody was hurt, and according to company spokesperson Pavla Mandátová, the incident will not hinder the safe operation of the distribution station.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, although the exact figure will not be known until the fire has been extinguished.
Mandátová says that the ruined transformer will have to be replaced with a new one.
She added that nothing like this had ever happened in the ten years that Čeps has been operating, and this kind of fault was a one-off.
According to ČEZ spokeswoman for northern Bohemia, Sonia Holingerová Hendrychová, there were no power cuts and households, offices and companies were not affected by the transformer fire.
In the Czech Republic, the joint stock company Čeps is the exclusive operator of transmission systems and 400 kV and 220 kV power lines.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 switching stations with 67 transformers converting electricity from the transmission system to the distribution system, as well as 4339 kilometres of power lines.
Jančura files a slander suit against three ČSSD commissioners
The owner of Student Agency, Radim Jančura, will today file a slander suit against three social democrat commissioners.
These are Michal Hašek, commissioner for South Moravia, Radko Martínek, commissioner for Pardubice, and Olomouc commissioner Martin Tesařík.
Jančura announced this in the Twenty Minutes programme on Radiožurnál.
The suit relates to the company's attempts to operate regional trains in certain regions.
However, all the regions eventually signed a long-term contract with Czech Railways.
So now all three commissioners are attacking us and saying that we're getting the best out of it, while the offer we put forward was just what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we're more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, as we know the Czech Railways prices that were concluded last week.
So all we can do is defend ourselves.
It's for slander against Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
He also said that he has proof from all the regional authorities that they did not act in accordance with European law.
He is therefore preparing a motion for the European Commission.
Hašek sees the suit as a further continuation of Mr Jančura's great media show, which works as a free advertisement for himself and his company.
It's understandable that I'm prepared to defend my good name and that of my region, and I call upon the other commissioners to do the same.
I expect that this matter will clearly show that it is Mr Jančura who is manipulating the public over regional rail transport and using lies and false arguments, said Hašek.
Last week, Jančura said that he is investing several million crowns in advertising to draw attention to these inappropriate actions taken by the regional authorities.
He told Radiožurnál that he was halting the campaign for Christmas and would restart it in the New Year.
He specified that the campaign would fight corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions decided to operate regional rail links with Czech Railways and had not announced tenders for the order, worth around 150 billion crowns.
According to Jančura this is illegal and in contravention of the principles of the European Court of Justice.
Jančura claims that his criticism of regional rail transport has already led to his being threatened by a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we don't stop this, we could lose our bus licence.
He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know who it was but I'm not going to say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Vaccinations against pneumococcus will be free and voluntary.
Starting January, vaccinations against pneumococcus will radically change ingrained habits.
These should be the first free yet voluntary vaccinations for families.
But some are saying that compulsory vaccinations would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free anti-pneumococcus vaccinations are reaching a peak.
The pharmaceutical institute is already setting the maximum price for vaccines to be paid for by health insurance companies.
Experts are now clear on how to proceed with the vaccinations.
New vaccinations
Vaccines free of charge for children born in August
Starting January, there could be free anti-pneumococcus vaccinations for children born on or after August 2nd.
The condition is that they have not received any prior vaccinations.
Anyone who began to be vaccinated last year or earlier will have to pay for any later re-vaccinations.
The first batch of vaccinations must be given when the child is between 3 and 5 months old.
Last year, one in four families had their children voluntarily vaccinated against pneumococcus.
Parents paid 1600 crowns or more per vaccination.
The youngest children require four vaccinations.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year on vaccinations.
But they save on the treatment that unvaccinated children would otherwise need.
So far, the state has been paying around 500 thousand crowns a year on all general vaccinations for children.
Subsidised vaccinations were introduced as part of the Janota package.
Pneumococcus causes infections of the middle ear, but also serious infections of the cerebral membranes and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections claim the lives of up to 28 children under the age of ten every year, according to hospital figures.
Besides the Czech Republic, around 40 countries have introduced general anti-pneumococcus vaccinations for children.
Will vaccinations be compulsory?
Some believe that in the future these vaccinations could be compulsory.
As of January, they should be paid for by the insurance companies and not compulsory.
The head of the Nahlas civil association, Rudolf Kalovský, says that compulsory vaccinations would be better.
His association has long been promoting pneumococcus vaccines.
The specialists at the international conference that our association attended were not very happy to hear that we have voluntary vaccinations.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we're happy that we managed to get at least these voluntary vaccinations in place.
I think this is the route we have to take, said Kalovský.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcus vaccination system.
We're not considering it at this time, said ministry spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccinations have their drawbacks, say doctors
The chairwoman of the Professional Society of Paediatricians, Hana Cabrnochová, acknowledges that voluntary vaccinations have their drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, the number of revaccinations could then be cut. "With vaccines costing so much, we can understand the political decision that vaccinations should be offered on a voluntary basis," says Cabrnochová.
Experts assume that, starting next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their babies vaccinated against pneumococcus.
The anti-pneumococcus vaccinations are a milestone in that they are the first general vaccinations for children to be paid for by the insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should fund prevention to save money on later treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy vaccines themselves
However, practising paediatricians are concerned when it comes to buying the vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines would be purchased by the insurance companies, and doctors would receive them in the same way that the state issues drugs for other vaccinations.
Some ministers, however, are worried that the insurance companies could "run wild with health insurance funds".
So doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until the insurance companies refund the money.
It is estimated that practising paediatricians will have to spend 40 thousand a month on vaccines, which is a lot of money.
It certainly won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
US artist's son 'in museum theft'
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta, has been charged with trying to steal paintings worth $20m (£12m) from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
They say Mr Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr Frazetta Snr, aged 81, is famed for his depiction of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The artist was in Florida at the time of the incident, the Associated Press news agency reported.
AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying the younger Mr Frazetta may have been motivated by a family feud.
A police affidavit said Mr Frazetta Jnr, 52, claimed he had been instructed by his father to "enter the museum by any means necessary to move all the paintings to a storage facility", the agency reported.
Mr Frazetta Snr denied granting any such permission, the agency said.
Labour defends budget tax rises
Ministers have defended the tax rises and spending cuts announced in the pre-Budget report against criticism from the opposition, business and unions.
The Tories said Alistair Darling "blew" an opportunity to show he was serious about cutting the deficit by delaying decisions until after the election.
The chancellor also came under fire for hitting low and middle income workers.
Among his headline proposals are a 0.5% rise in National Insurance and a 1% cap on public pay settlements from 2011.
National Insurance anger
Unions have protested that low-paid workers are being penalised for a recession not of their making and warned of "problems" ahead.
The National Insurance increase - which will raise about £3bn a year - has angered the business community, which says it is a tax on jobs when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 a year, will hit about 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF PBR
National Insurance up by a further 0.5% from April 2011
Economy to shrink by worse than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
1p rise in corporation tax for small firms scrapped
Tax rebates for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension to rise by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, someone earning £30,000 will be £90 a year worse off and someone on £40,000 will be £190 worse off, while someone earning £10,000 a year will be £110 better off.
Ministers said their target of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the burden of extra taxes would fall upon the top 5% of earners.
Treasury minister Stephen Timms denied the tax rises and spending cuts outlined were a "drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These are large numbers. They will deliver for us this halving of the deficit which is absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was confident the economy would return to growth by the turn of the year.
However, Labour forecasts for future economic growth - which will influence the amount it has to borrow and how quickly he deficit is cut - have been questioned after the chancellor was forced to revise earlier figures.
In his statement, he said the economy was likely to contract 4.75% this year - far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while borrowing would be £3bn higher than earlier estimated.
'Blown opportunity'
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday warning of Labour's "debt crisis", said projected borrowing of £789bn over the next six years was unsustainable.
Mnisters had failed to lay out a credible plan for how they would pay this back, they added, "cynically" ducking tough choices until after the election - which must be held by June 2010.
"They have not included anything of significance they are going to do," said shadow Treasury minister Philip Hammond. "They had an opportunity to do it and they have blown it."
" The all important announcements will come after the election, whoever wins it "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insist that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts unlike under Tory proposals which would see the deficit cut faster and further.
But the Lib Dems said the money raised by tax rises and spending cuts would be used to support spending next year not to reduce the deficit, arguing the plans were "built on sand".
The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said some of the timing of the announcements - such as the above inflation increase in some disability benefits next April - would leave the chancellor open to accusations of electioneering as the money may simply be clawed back the year after.
However, Labour insist the extra help is being provided when people need it most and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
'Phoney budget'
Although ministers did not publish spending details for beyond 2011, economists said it was clear the squeeze on public spending would only begin to bite in the medium term.
The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the chancellor's figures implied substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence, in the future.
"It really is holding off the pain until later," said its director Robert Chote.
"The all important announcements will come after the election, whoever wins it," added Roger Bootle, economic adviser to accountants Deloitte.
"This has been the phoney pre-Budget report. The markets realise this."
FBI probes 'US Pakistan arrests'
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five reported US men on suspicion of extremist links.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda in eastern Punjab province, Pakistan's US embassy told the BBC.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who were reported missing from their homes in the US state of Virginia last month.
The US State Department said it was also seeking information on the men.
Three of them are reported to be of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, we of course are going to be very interested in the charges that they've been detained on and in what sort of circumstances they're being held," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with Pakistan authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who had gone missing," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to an uncle of one of them.
He said the house was already of interest to local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, reported the Reuters news agency, but said the US had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing from their homes in northern Virginia by their families in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian 'abuses'
Human rights in Iran are as poor as at any time over the past 20 years, according to a report from campaign group Amnesty International.
The report details "patterns of abuse" by the regime before and after disputed presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has dismissed previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials have said such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been given jail terms, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that early in the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, accepted some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, there has been almost no tolerance of criticism by the authorities, our correspondent says.
'False confession'
Amnesty International cited the account of 26-year-old computing student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the election result.
"They frequently beat me on the face," he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, on the neck, head... They threatened to execute me and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and was taken out and left in the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the rape claims, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he was held in a container with 75 others for more than eight weeks at a detention centre at Kahrizak.
Amnesty accepted that the Iranian parliament and judiciary had established committees to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response, but it said the mandate and powers of the bodies were unclear and the parliamentary committee's findings had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks to forestall further demonstrations.
Ski slope is created in city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol landmark into a piste for a competition.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snow borders competing for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill park there was a short jump ramp before a 100m-long slope.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope but it was pretty daunting.
It's a beautiful view with all the city lights below all twinkling.
There's some of the best skiers and snow borders in the county here - some real talent," he added.
Prizes were awarded for the best tricks - or manoeuvres performed on the slope.
After Thursday evening's event the snow will be left to melt away.
Still them and us
Can Islam Be French?
Pluralism and Pragmatism in a Secularist State.
AT A time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and there is widespread alarm over the supposed Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written an informed and measured account of whether Muslims can integrate—and are integrating—into one of the continent’s most avowedly secular societies.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author’s last work, "Why the French Don’t Like Headscarves" (2006), an elegant and closely argued study of an issue that divided and preoccupied the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr Bowen’s latest book has a broader and more ambitious canvas.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not just what the politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is actually happening on the ground.
He has spent months in the mosques, schools and institutes which now provide France’s 5m-6m Muslims with what Mr Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students about the questions that concern them most.
Should a Muslim get married in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and gay rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, that are the stuff of daily life rather than the political dramas that preoccupy the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them household names, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They are not having the argument all their way.
Conservatives are suspicious of the very idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists whom Mr Bowen interviews tend to be at odds with their Salafi counterparts—advocates of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia—who nowadays have a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Mr Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But accommodation requires give-and-take on both sides.
He questions how far French policymakers (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely guards laïcité) are really committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims are probably getting a rawer deal than the Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make their historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, he detects a "tightening of the value-screws".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say, "Yes, but not yet."
The bleakest outlook in the world
THE Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environment on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting with alarming speed, taking with it life that can survive nowhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have been heading into the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers, and now authors, in their wake.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Well-versed in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by taking on the white bear.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter as a plucky 14-year-old midshipman fighting only with the butt of his musket is surely a myth, but others are true.
Young bears, captured as they swam after the bodies of their newly killed mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
One early 20th-century big-top act featured 75 polar bears at once.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still typically a millionth of the area of a wild adult’s range. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr Ellis draws on the accounts of other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and skidoo-riding Inuit Indians both use high-powered assault rifles to bring down their quarry.
Ironically it is in the waters towards the north of those two hunting nations that the ice will last longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling account of the science of the Arctic and a gripping glimpse of how the future may turn out there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately account for the speed of the changes.
It is not for want of trying.
Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering journeys at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century first hinted at the whirling of the ice pack.
Cold-war submarines then mapped the shifting ridges running beneath it.
Satellite surveys and large arrays of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful addition, but much is still done by hardy individuals camped out in the cold.
Mr Anderson looks in on the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system within the Arctic ice, formed by trickles of briny water which gets squeezed as it freezes.
But from the bear above to the microscopic wonders within, all are doomed once the summer ice goes, which is expected to happen at some point between 2013 and 2050.
'In a few months...this could be us'
Marines among 6,000 who place wreaths on graves at Arlington
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single wreath on the tomb of a soldier whom he'd never met.
For him, and the other Marines who took the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C. to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, the day was about paying tribute to men and women who once stood in their shoes.
In a few months, from where we are getting shipped out, this could be us, said Robinson of the fallen soldiers.
If it is us, I would want somebody to do the same for me so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to place wreaths on veterans' gravesites across several sections of Arlington Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, began the event when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred gravesites at Arlington Ceremony.
Now an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen, make the trip every year stopping in different cities along the way to host events dedicated to the people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit, Wreaths Across America, which has spread the event across other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at Arlington Cemetery, areas at the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pa.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase, and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased career military man.
While her husband is not buried at Arlington, Hunt said this was her way of giving back to those who made sacrifices.
It's a small way civilians can support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family gravesite.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked across the cemetery's expansive lawns and hills.
Volunteers targeted older tombs from World War I, World War II, and the war in Vietnam because they are not visited as often as newer graves, organizers said.
The mood was upbeat as children played and couples held hands while carrying the fresh pine to the graying tombstones.
Each circular wreath was a deep green with a small red bow fastened across the top.
Nearby, Section 60, where most veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate the section but the somber mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals openly wept, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the frigid air.
Some read aloud names carved into the stones while others bowed to see small black and white place cards pushed inside wet mud for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers wiping tears from her eyes in front of her son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio to visit the gravesite of Marine Gunnery Sgt. David Shane Spicer who died in combat in July.
Nobody should ever forget why we're free. . .my son paid for that, she said.
"When I'm long gone, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. government contractor arrested by Cuban officials
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who was distributing cellphones and laptop computers in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers with the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested Dec. 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, though under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for nearly anything under the claim of "dangerousness."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include mild protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a fledging blogging community, led by the popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has repeatedly applied for permission to leave the country to accept awards but has been denied permission.
The detention of an American contractor may likely raise tensions between the Castro brothers Communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been pursuing a "go-slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
News of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times Friday night.
The new U.S. policy stresses that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, the United States will reciprocate.
Cellphones and laptops are legal in Cuba, though they are new and coveted commodities in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy cellphones just this year; they are used mostly for texting, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would eat up a day's wages.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and to foreign visitors there, and at some government outlets, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log on often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many Web sites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in jail in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal -- giving away free cellphones -- is in Cuba a crime, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently issued a tough report on freedoms in Cuba called "New Castro, Same Cuba," a reference to the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country to replace his ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in a day.
He said that any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States just as the two countries begin to move toward more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unraveling plot to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday zeroed in on the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five Northern Virginia men to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters who scour the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were hunting for a shadowy insurgent figure known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one made comments approving of terror attacks on the Internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah guided the men once they were in Pakistan, attempting to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt that is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in convincing al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were marooned for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidding mountains of the northwest that have become a terrorist haven.
They were regarded as a sting operation.
That's why they were rejected, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were undeterred and were still trying to acquire the right endorsements to gain access to the al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of the five -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determining who can be trusted.
Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to place human assets inside al-Qaeda.
The organization's recruiters act as gatekeepers, keeping out those who are not serious about their commitment to holy war, and those who could be spies.
Would-be American recruits are treated by al-Qaeda with special scrutiny, analysts said.
But they are also considered enormously appealing to the group because of their potential to access U.S. targets and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst with the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terror groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they allow in because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruiting methods.
If you're trying to sink someone into these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed? Kohlmann said.
The model is one that has become far more Web-based.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate 'action'
Tens of thousands of protesters marched on the streets here Saturday, demanding bolder action on climate from the negotiators working inside the city's Bella Convention Center.
Protesters said as many 100,000 people joined in the event, but police estimated the count was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, though a handful of masked activists set off small explosives near a group of government buildings downtown.
On a day when little happened in the U.N.-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked across the city holding banners in English saying "There is No Planet B" and one in Spanish declaring, "The Earth is Saying, 'Enough.'
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother's native country of Peru made me aware of the heartbreaking issues the country is dealing with due to the impacts of climate changes that are already occurring."
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the big march -- to pass on the word and to appeal to the world's leaders to deliver a fair, ambitious and binding deal, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it needs to be done, there is no way around it anymore.
The police kept the protesters from getting too close to the Bella center, and said they had arrested 19 people, primarily on the grounds that they had either worn masks or carried pocket knives.
Those activities are banned during demonstrations under Danish law.
According to one bystander, who asked not to be identified because he is involved in the climate talks, activists sporting masks and black outfits set off several explosives near Copenhagen's main canal, which is nearby several ministries.
They were lobbing them by the buildings, he said, adding they began as flares but were followed by "a couple big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials such as Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked whether he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on the international deliberations, he replied in English, "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of."
He then continued in Mandarin, saying, "Because the venue is large, I cannot hear what is happening outside."
He observed that whether the march was hurting or helping depended on one's perspective.
It shows the concentration of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "You can also say that they disrupt the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Test data reveal stubborn racial gaps
Last week's federal report card on math achievement was a welcome piece of good news for D.C. public schools.
Although the District still lags far behind the country's top-performing systems, the report card showed fourth- and eighth-graders making strides at a faster pace over the past two years than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains embedded in the latest numbers from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent achievement gap between African American and white students both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white D.C. fourth-graders over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African American peers' rose just three points, from 209 to 212.
The achievement gap actually grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
African American progress in the eighth grade remained essentially flat, dipping a statistically insignificant one point, from 245 to 244.
Average white scores were not included in the test results because the sample size wasn't large enough.
The picture across a six-year stretch isn't more encouraging.
The gap separating white and black fourth-graders in 2003, when the first NAEP in the District was given, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has barely narrowed to 58.
Some education advocates in the District expressed concern last week that the gains celebrated by Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were propelled largely by white students who are already high achievers.
It would suggest that we've raised the aggregate by treating those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and troublesome, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for educational equality in the District.
I'm not jumping up and down about a two- or three-point spread, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade at Eaton Elementary.
A frequent critic of Rhee's management style, Brown said the message of the test scores is that the city's middle schools are in desperate need of attention.
Clearly, you always want to see the plus signs, and I respect that.
But what's scary is we're not spending nearly the time and energy we need to spend on our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-achieving students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, targeted to students in the upper elementary and middle school grades who didn't master the basics of reading early in their school careers and are significantly behind their peers.
Everyday Mathematics, a K-through-sixth-grade math curriculum emphasizing games and real-life experiences that was brought to the District under former superintendent Clifford Janey, is credited with some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I just think we have to keep working at bringing the best interventions to those students who are below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP's results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to lift the overall performance of the system and still provide the additional money and resources for low-performing schools that will be necessary to narrow the gap.
There is a sort of rough-edged dilemma here for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California at Berkeley who studies urban test scores.
The conventional policy remedy is to target your resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
So the targeting may yield political repercussions that go against that important agenda.
But the rub, of course, is like other urban superintendents, she's trying to hold on to the white and black middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, are confident that their children can get an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that one essential element to closing the achievement gap is to lengthen the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with charter schools.
You have to get up near 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who came to agreement with his teachers' union last year on a 185-day year, which he regards as "a marker" for seeking a bigger increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a part of more futures
The tour bus pulled into Gettysburg College with a loud wheeze.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stepped off and blinked for a moment at the white columns, brick facades and emerald lawns.
Graciela's parents had barely graduated from high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Yet as she and the other eighth-graders in the group explored Gettysburg, where the tuition runs $38,690 a year, their attitude was less that of awestruck visitors than of enthusiastic prospective students.
Yes! This is where I'll be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they'd entered the science building.
Wow, really? she said thoughtfully, when told of the school's low professor-to-student ratio.
The Pennsylvania college was the seventh the kids had visited on their three-day tour, and by now they had completely absorbed its intended message: The question is not whether you're going to college.
The question is where.
Although there is mounting concern about the large number U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or get pregnant as teenagers, there are also hundreds of thousands who are getting the college educations they need to enter the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second-generation" Hispanics graduates from college -- a notable achievement given that so many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play an outsize role in the country's workforce.
Those who study high achievers say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate drive to succeed.
Many also have parents who set lofty goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their unfamiliarity with American schools.
But mentoring programs also can play an enormous role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her make it to college -- particularly if those efforts are sustained over time.
When you're looking at low-income kids whose parents don't have the experience and the skills to help them navigate through the system, any single intervention at any one point in time is not going to solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has studied Latino students.
We need to think about providing a supportive network for these kids from preschool all the way on through high school.
The federal program that funded Graciela's college tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to run college prep programs that begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent going on to college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches deals with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its ailing infrastructure during two auctions that concluded Saturday.
The 10 deals the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil firms are poised to play a major role in refurbishing Iraq's oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies walked away with stakes in just two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began Friday.
The only one that submitted a bid lost.
Two American companies reached deals for fields auctioned in June.
The meager representation of American oil giants in Iraq's opening oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, you have Asians and Europeans leading the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news outlet.
It will be a long time before anything else will be on offer in Iraq.
Concerns over security, underscored by massive coordinated bombings Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military withdraws, likely kept American oil companies from venturing more forcefully in Iraq, which has the world's third-largest proven crude reserves, analysts said.
U.S. firms were in some cases at a disadvantage because rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government controlled energy firms, have markedly lower labor costs and are more prone to take risks because they don't respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that reached deals with the ministry.
Major U.S. firms such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have cultivated close ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and have provided technical advice in recent years, walked away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the top stakeholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
State-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. bid on more contracts than any other company and walked away with large stakes in contracts for two major fields.
We all know that China is on track to become a major economic as well as technological power, Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said.
We feel confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will deliver on its commitments towards Iraq.
Companies pre-selected to submit bids made offers that were then compared to the per barrel fee the ministry was willing to pay for boosting output above current levels at each field.
Top al-Qaeda planner apparently killed in Pakistan
An apparent U.S. missile strike along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al-Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a senior terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men thought to have been killed when a pair of missiles tore into their car Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type operated by the CIA inside Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They were driving in a white car, heading toward the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said an official with Pakistan's civilian intelligence agency, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The official said suspected local militants rushed to the spot and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally demolished bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the victims' identities, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a senior al-Qaeda military planner who ran the terrorist group's operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was engaged in plotting throughout the world, said one senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of U.S. airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given his central role, this probably included plotting attacks against the United States and Europe.
He took strategic guidance from al-Qaeda's top leadership and translated it into operational blueprints for prospective terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had risen quickly through al-Qaeda's ranks and was well-connected with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be a household name to some Americans, but that in no way diminishes the threat he posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second senior al-Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar strike killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal belt, and three other top operatives.
The tempo of strikes by CIA-run drones has declined since the summer, from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to a tally by the Long War Journal, a Web site managed by a nonprofit group.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site said.
Top U.N. envoy in Kabul to step down
The United Nations' top envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would step down from his post in March, ending a tumultuous tenure that was marred by allegations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan's U.N.-backed presidential election.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said that he supports the surge but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for a military drawdown beginning in 18 months would prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the buildup of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants aiding Afghanistan's political transition.
The surge on the military side has to be copied on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning but simply fulfilling a commitment he made to his family in March 2008 to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to serve notice to U.N.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon now so that he would have time to find a replacement.
What I've said is that you better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between a departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun searching for a replacement, according to U.N. officials.
The officials say he has been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian national who recently headed the U.N. mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led U.N. peacekeeping operations.
Eide's standing in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and of covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the allegations, but he said the accusations by Galbraith -- who was fired -- "certainly damaged the mission, because there was already a great degree of skepticism with regard to international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate relief efforts by the U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the U.N. leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that donate to the Afghan mission, saying it would increase their confidence that their money is being properly spent.
Eide expressed frustration with the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, saying that cumbersome U.N. hiring regulations undercut his ability to bring in talent.
The U.N. rules are such that I have only been able to recruit a single person since May, he said.
That is catastrophic and can't continue.
Gates: Iran to face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran over its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, played down the prospect of military action against the Islamic republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a query from a soldier about the likelihood of such a development. ¨
One of the things that weighs on me is that if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, [it] is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of the sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that "a package of incentives and disincentives" would be needed "to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less secure with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer enormously" from sanctions.
In a statement Friday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face "credible" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the U.N. Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on Oct. 1, it indicated that it would return to talks on restraining its nuclear program and agree to give up a substantial portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement as a way to build confidence between the two sides and to buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have walked away from the tentative deals -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, Iran's stiffing the international community on some of the proposals that they actually agreed to at the beginning of October, I think, has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions on the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a Dec. 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals before he turns to reviewing other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "crippling sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "baseless and unfounded allegations" Thursday by some Security Council members about Iran's nuclear activities and said it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before flying to Iraq's oil-rich Kurdish region for meetings with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and Iraq's Arab majority, particularly over boundaries, property rights and revenue-sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to prevent any delays in U.S. plans to cut the number of American troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to allay Kurdish anxiety about the pending drawdown. U.S. officials quoted Gates as telling Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon you."
In aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters lecturing them that "Mother Earth is too tired to sustain more children" and "One more baby means one more tomb."
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by their city's low birthrate and aging population, abruptly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy for just one child.
We have none left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources administrator with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after China's one-child policy was introduced, creating two generations of notoriously chubby, spoiled only children affectionately nicknamed "little emperors," a population crisis is looming in the country.
The average birthrate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple as compared with six when the policy went into effect, according to the U.N.
Population Division, while the number of residents 60 and older is predicted to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. That is far above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in wealthy coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people 60 and older accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birthrate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that fertile couples need to have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and alleviate a workforce shortage in the future."
Shanghai is about to be "as old -- not as rich, though -- as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual easing
Written into the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate the policy face enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
Chinese officials have credited the policy with helping the country avoid critical strain on its natural resources, while human rights advocates have denounced abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced women pregnant with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had sex-selective abortions, leading to an unnaturally high male-to-female ratio.
In recent years, population officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed for more exceptions to the rule -- including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are only children -- and in 2007, they toned down many of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters directing families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be eligible to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet with couples in their homes and slip leaflets under doors.
It has also pledged to provide emotional and financial counseling to those electing to have more than one child.
The response has been underwhelming, family planning officials say.
Disappointing response
Although officials in one rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they saw an uptick in applications from couples wanting a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban districts report no change.
Huinan township, with a population of 115,000, for instance, is still receiving just four to five applications a month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai's Caolu township, said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don't want more children.
They want to give the best to their first, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only the scant medical and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social safety net, they say, the choice would be irresponsible.
People in the West wrongly see the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
Yes, we are being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just some policy.
It is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for hesitating.
Wang, the human resources administrator, said she wants an only child because she was one herself: "We were at the center of our families and used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of and don't really want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, put it more bluntly.
For the dual-career, middle-class parents who are bringing the birthrate down, he said, it's about being successful enough to be selfish.
Today's 20- and 30-somethings grew up seeing their parents struggle during the early days of China's experiment with capitalism and don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even one child makes huge demands on parents' time, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the space issues -- "You have to remodel your apartment" -- and the strategizing -- "You have to have a résumé ready by the time the child is 9 months old for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to deal with this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Ours is the first generation with higher living standards, he said.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
U.N. group drafts plan to reduce emissions
The U.N.-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by unruly posturing and mutual recriminations -- gained renewed focus Friday with the release of a document outlining ambitious greenhouse-gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden in the near term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political deal to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles as much as it illuminated a path forward.
But it was seen as an important advance in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Forged by a U.N. ad-hoc working group, the text is silent on how much money rich countries would give poor ones to cope with global warming over the short and long term.
And it provides a range of options for the key questions, including how developed and major emerging economies would cut their carbon output, and what would be the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
It gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, senior Washington representative for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, boiled down a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what the U.N.'s top climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the big picture."
It shows the outlines for a possible deal, in which industrial nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent compared with 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce theirs during the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union gave the talks a boost as well on Friday by pledging to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- from coping with flood and drought to avoiding deforestation.
Still, Friday featured the same sort of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks for the past week.
U.S. special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected language requiring binding cuts of greenhouse-gas emissions for industrialized countries compared with voluntary ones by major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The move signaled that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States is not going to do a deal without the major developing countries stepping up and taking action, said Stern, who also complained that the text did not do enough to make sure the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese vice foreign minister He Yafei said America's top climate negotiator was either lacking "common sense" or being "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is as much about saving individual economies as saving the planet, with China and the United States feuding over their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the world's two dozen most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it's not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs for curbing greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to hold the big emitters accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who also serves as the regional Mexico and Central America climate change adviser for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say the talks will produce a political deal at best.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, produced a 24-page draft treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now unified and demanding action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government arrive to strike a deal.
High-level officials such as Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese vice minister stepped off planes and raced through the Bella Center's halls to closed-door meetings and news conferences so they could stake out claims that will be arbitrated over the next week.
The sheer sprawl of the gathering -- where 13,000 people move in and out of the convention center each day, guitar-playing activists put on nightly shows mocking the countries they think are selling out, and draft proposals are passed hand-to-hand on paper rather than via e-mail -- poses a challenge.
The intensity is only building: nearly all of the key ministers are now here, and as early as Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We're getting into the big leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain’s first 140mph train to redefine that Monday feeling
At 5.13 on Monday morning a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 140mph as it streaks from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, will then be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin commuter service out of London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually plug Britain into an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
Neglected backwaters would become thriving commuter towns, business travel times would be slashed and the shift from aircraft and cars to the railway would reduce national carbon emissions as well as easing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties buy into this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental harm may yet put the brakes on Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will hand its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, The Times has learnt.
It will provide him with a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn to within five metres in urban areas and sites where the environmental impact may be contentious.
In open country, the plan will be drafted to within 25 metres of a final route.
HS2 is also expected to set out three options for a wider high-speed network running north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The favoured option being put forward is a Y-shaped configuration in which a single high-speed line would run up to the West Midlands.
The line would split at or near Birmingham, with one branch running west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another running northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would run into Scotland.
"It looks like it is going to be the best-performing option," a railway insider said.
Once complete, journey times between London and Edinburgh would be cut to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first leg, which would not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour at present.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 250mph, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to take trains 400m in length capable of carrying 1,100 people.
As many as 18 could operate each hour on a London-Birmingham line.
That means that a London terminal capable of handling 20,000 passengers an hour would be needed.
Given space constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the scheme should proceed, but lengthy public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision would not be made until after a general election.
Even if he does put the wheels in motion, the network would have to be built in sections.
Trains would at first be forced to run off high-speed lines on to the existing rails north of Birmingham, keeping journey times between London and Scotland above three hours.
That is seen as the crucial tipping point needed to ensure a switch from planes to trains, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers meet mortgage on Tory's £75,000 orangery
Alan Duncan, the frontbench Tory MP, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year towards the cost of an orangery he built at his constituency home.
The party’s prisons spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living "on rations", increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak-framed extension to his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the extra interest, totalling hundreds of pounds a month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities approved the claims at the time and they have not been queried by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of members’ expenses. Last night Mr Duncan said the claims "couldn’t be cleaner or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
Houses near by have sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fees office agreed that Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a conservatory to the house, described in plans as an "orangery".
Neighbours described it as a "glasshouse for entertaining".
Mr Duncan was not required to make any reference to the increased borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons’ Standards and Privileges Committee into his previous mortgage arangements.
The committee cleared him last month of breaching the rules after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004 Mr Duncan changed the legal security for a £271,406 mortgage from his London property to his constituency home, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became an MP.
Documents released this week show that Mr Duncan was claiming about £1,400 a month in mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than £1,800 a month.
The interest rate on Mr Duncan’s RBS mortgage did not change in that time, suggesting that all the increase was to fund the £75,000 borrowing.
The RBS standard variable mortgage rate went down from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, where it remains.
The latest document release by the Commons authorities show that Mr Duncan was continuing to claim £1,250 a month this May.
Mr Duncan lost his job as Shadow Leader of the House in September after an undercover reporter filmed him saying that MPs had to survive "on rations" after the expenses scandal.
"Basically, it’s being nationalised, you have to live on rations and are treated like s**t."
He said: "I spend my money on my garden and claim a tiny fraction based on what is proper.
And I could claim the whole bloody lot, but I don’t."
The MP, a millionaire from his former career as an oil trader, was first challenged over his expenses in May when it emerged that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the fees office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the shape of a pound sign in Mr Duncan’s lawn in protest after it was revealed that he claimed £4,000 over three years.
Asked about the increased mortgage last night, Mr Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements approved both by the fees office and subsequently by Legg."
He added: "There is no issue of ducking and weaving or pushing the rules or anything.
It is absolutely straight down the line, within the rules, authorised and everything.
It just couldn’t in many ways be cleaner or simpler."
Come all ye faithful to see Brighton’s beach hut Advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new lease of life for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for each day in December, using Christmas carols as their theme.
The event started on December 1, with visitors allowed to view the latest hut from 5.30pm to 6.30pm each day, with mince pies and mulled wine laid on for free.
Carols chosen so far include I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, where the hut features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a non-stipendiary clergyman within the Chichester diocese and the leader of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more relevant to people in a post-Christendom society.
"Why do we as a Church expect people to come to a strange old building? It’s my feeling the Church should come to the people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the beach hut Advent calendar began just as a conversation with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we are trying to try and represent that through spirituality."
Large climate change gatherings in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to support an ambitious and restrictive agreement in the fight against global warming around the world and in Copenhagen, where police made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police, and a hundred thousand, according to the organisers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital outside the United Nations climate conference, which is tasked with reaching an agreement by Friday that will enter into effect on the 1st of January, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish climate conference president, the increasing number of climate rallies around the world, illustrated by these protests, has contributed to making the 'political cost' of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the main procession, when a group of 300 protesters, clothed entirely in black, broke shop windows with paving and hammers, observed a reporter from the AFP.
Riot police provided an immediate and unhesitant response.
Police announced a total of 600 to 700 hundred arrests, with most, they report, being members of the 'Black Blocks'; small ultra-violent groups that had notably made an appearance at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in the East of France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the protest organisers, reported conditions whereby hundreds of protesters were arrested "without discrimination," highlighting that a hundred of them "were still detained in the street on Saturday night" handcuffed and held in a sitting position despite the extreme cold".
Having left the Parliament, the procession headed in an orderly fashion towards the Bella Center, where negotiations were to take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres short of the building without trying to enter.
A stage had been raised to receive the expected speakers before a candlelit vigil, in which the former South African Archbishop from Cape Town, Desmond Tutu would be taking part.
The majority of protesters had arrived by coach and train from the major European cities, but many Asian protesters, including some Chinese and Korean, were also present, as well as those from Africa.
Around 3000 people, mainly clad in sky blue raincoats, had formed an initial rally in Copenhagen during the morning, called by Friends of the Earth, who were planning "blue waves" for "climate justice".
We are marching on the streets today to demand reparations of the ecological debt for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist in the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to tell ourselves that there is time left, assesses the singer from Benin, Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers drying out in Africa; water courses, where it is possible to walk and never was before.
For the first time in the history of Climate Diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalisation movement has brought itself closer to environmental organisations.
The French Eurodeputy, José Bové, a face of anti-globalisation, explained that he has come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice with social justice" : "Today there is no gap between the fight against global warming and the anti-globalisation fight."
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to numerous islands, which are particularly vulnerable to the effects of warming, had kicked off the protests.
According to organisers, some 50 000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red, brandishing banners about the benefits of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Djakarta, and in Canada, rallies of several hundred demonstrators were also formed to demand more forceful action against climate change.
In France, the protests organised by the "350" network brought together several hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseilles (in the South), Lille (in the North), Bordeaux (in the West), and Lyon (in the East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president; Georgia calls it a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little over a year after Moscow's recognition of the pro-Russian region of Georgia, while Tbilisi calls it a "farce".
Some 131 000 people were called on to take part in this first vote following the Georgia-Russia war in August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another secessionist Georgian territory recognised by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
Attendance was at 58% a few hours before closure, according to Abkhazian electoral Commission officials.
The first provisional results were to be announced during the night between Saturday and Sunday.
The five candidates in the running, among whom the existing president, Sergei Bagapsh, all categorically reject the idea of a reunification with Georgia, which has condemned the holding of the vote.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under total Russian occupation," declared his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Other than Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognised the independence of the territory's 216 000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating itself from Georgia in the 1992-1993 conflict, which saw the loss of several thousand lives, Abkhazia is trying to show, by means of this election, that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, declared Svetlana Kvarchia, a 54-year-old historian, who confirms having voted for Mister Bagapsh.
She was among the voters who came to the polling station in an attractive white school building with several palm trees at the front in the capital, Soukhoumi.
The question of the Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential debate, in this region gifted with a lush landscape on the Black Sea.
Vast billboards showing Mister Bagapsh beside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are dotted around this small territory of 216 000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the West of the country, the Chief of District, Beslan Archba, reserved a very warm welcome for the Russian officials who came to oversee the voting.
We, the Abkhazian people, are thankful, he said during a small ceremony, alluding to the support from Moscow, and particularly to the decision to recognise the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian Parliament, while raising his glass of vodka.
For their part, the opposition represented in the vote by the former vice-president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises the agreements made with Moscow in the previous year, such as the one giving Russia control of the Abkhazian rail network for the next 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, asserts not being in support of the current Government or the opposition.
50% plus one vote is the majority required to win the vote.
If no candidate attains this threshold, a second vote must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: demonstrations around the world, incidents in Copenhagen.
Tens of thousands of people the world over marched on Saturday to demand an ambitious and restrictive agreement at the Climate Conference in Copenhagen, where police were on alert and arrested almost 700 people on the fringes of an imposing rally.
Thirty thousand people, according to police, a hundred thousand, according to organisers, paraded in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which is receiving delegates from 193 countries until the 18th of December, who will be seeking to conclude an agreement to come into effect by the 1st of January, 2013.
Having left the Parliament, the procession headed in a generally orderly fashion for the Bella Center, where negotiations were to take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres short of the building without trying to enter.
A stage had been erected to accommodate the speakers, before a candlelit vigil, with the participation of former South African Cape Town archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the departure of the procession, a group of several hundred demonstrators, clad entirely in black and holding bricks and hammers, broke shop windows, remarked an AFP reporter.
Riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened in no uncertain terms, throwing several of them to the ground.
Police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 hundred people, adding that they were mainly members of the 'Black Blocks'; small ultra-violent groups that had notably made an appearance at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in the East of France, in April.
Towards the end of the afternoon a policeman was injured on the jaw by a piece of paving and four cars were set alight near a squat during a series of incidents, which led to the arrests of some twenty people, according to police.
We have our eye on the small extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as the force's helicopters circled in the sky above.
The majority of demonstrators were of European origin, arriving in coaches and trains from the main German cities, from London, from Amsterdam, and also from Milan.
Large numbers of Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
Around 3000 people, mainly clad in sky blue raincoats, had formed an initial rally in Copenhagen during the morning called by Friends of the Earth, who were planning "blue waves" for "climate justice".
We are taking to the streets today to demand the ecological debt be repaid to the South, explained Lily Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee Coalition Group in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to tell ourselves that there is time left, assesses the singer from Benin, Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers drying out in Africa; water courses, where it is possible to walk and never was before.
For the first time in the history of Climate Diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalisation movement has brought itself closer to environmental organisations.
The French Eurodeputy, José Bové, a face of anti-globalisation, explained that he has come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice with social justice" : "Today there is no gap between the fight against global warming and the anti-globalisation fight."
Oxfam enlisted the help of several well-known personalities, including Danish model Helena Christensen, and the former UN Commissioner for refugees, Mary Robinson, who were to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to numerous islands, which are particularly vulnerable to the effects of warming, had kicked off the protests.
According to organisers, some 50 000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red in front of the capital's City Hall, brandishing banners about the benefits of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, rallies of several hundred demonstrators were also formed to demand action against climate change.
In France, the protests organised by the "350" network brought together several hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseilles (in the South), Lille (in the North), Bordeaux (in the West), and Lyon (in the East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
History-Geography are strengthened by the secondary schools reform, according to Chatel
French Education Minister, Luc Chatel, declared in an interview to be published in the French Paper On Sunday (JDD) that History and Geography were "reinforced" by the secondary schools reform, despite them no longer being obligatory subjects for the French technical Sixth Form.
From now on, first year pupils will have four hours per week, and the same programme for a common shared culture, states Mr. Chatel.
According to the minister, "We need to get out of this hypocrisy" because, he says, "the 'S' course of study is no longer the science course", but "more generally, it is a magnet for the stronger pupils".
The 'ES' and 'L' courses cannot remain inferior choices behind the 'S' course, he continues, highlighting that "I have not heard many historians or academics expressing indignance at the absence of History-Geography in the technical Sixth Forms either."
On Saturday, an IFOP (French Public Opinion Institute) poll appearing in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten (69%) French people disapproved of the Government project to terminate compulsory teaching of History-Geography in technical Sixth Forms. Many academics and teachers also criticised this suppression, as have the left and some right-wing representatives.
On the other hand, the minister added that there was "no question" of eliminating the 'S' course philosophy.
Luc Chatel also defended the teachers' education reforms, just as 16 organisations (students and associations) called for a day of protest on Tuesday to demonstrate against the project, which, in their opinion, sacrifices the educational training of future teachers.
For 2nd year Master's (M2), an entry exam focusing on the candidate's discipline will be required at the start of the year, and an acceptance exam testing their capacity to teach will be held at the end of the year, the minister explained.
Furthermore, they will cover in-class placements throughout the M2 year, and will then be in front of pupils for a year as student teachers.
If you add up all the placement work proposed before the exam you already end up with more presence in front of students, which equates to over 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the minister indicates that he will be putting forward "the individual's right to education; something that does not exist in national Education".
He also reaffirms the plan to abolish the school map "by 2012".
At Normale Supérieure (one of France's top schools), experts have 15 minutes to change opinions on climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about what is at stake at the Copenhagen summit: that was the challenge taken up on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the intergovernmental group of Climate Evolution experts (GIEC) invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure in rue d'Ulm (Paris).
Jean Jouzel, Nobel Peace Prize winner, inaugurated the first of the conferences entitled "Ernest", a day composed of a series of 15-minute lectures from experts, filmed and open to the public, noted an AFP reporter.
We wanted to do something to catch people's attention and make them want to find out more, explained one of the day's organisers, 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, outside the conference; this having been named after the name given to the fish in the school's pond.
We choose around twenty lecturers among the experts in their field and the more charismatic ones are selected, he added.
On the subject of global warming, "we could go on for hours, but we can also cover the key objectives in a few minutes", Jean Jouzel told the AFP, who made his presentation without notes, but with graphical aids, to an audience of around fifty.
This is part of our scientist's role, he emphasised, hoping that listeners will remember that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely solid scientific case".
The video footage from the conferences will be available online on the school's website starting the 15th of December.
The next "Ernest" day is planned for February, followed by others on a bimonthly basis.
Late payments: anger from prison guards, action planned
Prison guard unions called for a "general rally" on Friday to demand payment of their bonuses and overtime before the end of the year holidays, having seen it pushed into January for budgetary reasons.
FO-pénitentiaire (2nd prison guard union) has requested that staff, who are not on duty, demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of prison buildings and to "block" them, in order to "expose the theft of their earnings".
The CGT-pénitentiaire (3rd union in the profession) calls for them to "unite in general, rallying at the various prisons, to show a strong turn-out", condemn the non-payment of "overtime, night-shift bonuses, Sunday and holiday pay" in December for their work in October as "shameful and unacceptable".
And the first prison guard union, Union fédérale autonome pénitentiaire (UFAP/UNSA), "calls for general rallying (…) to re-awaken the discontent and anger".
The penitentiary administration's Management and the Justice Ministry explain that overtime has increased considerably in 2009 and was not fully covered in the budget, but assures that the outstanding balances will be settled in January.
The Chancery stated near the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a communication to the prison guard unions guaranteeing the payment would be made next month.
I am not ignoring the efforts made by the staff for the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this communication.
I have asked the penitentiary administration Management to put in place, without delay, a set of measures to ensure that this situation, caused by a poor evaluation of the number of additional work hours, does not repeat itself in the future, adds Mrs. Alliot-Marie.
The December pay packet will therefore be slim, except for management staff, who benefit from the so-called target and position-related bonuses, critics the UFAP/UNSA, saying "budgetary constraints are a convenient excuse".
It is an absolute scandal, complains the inter-regional union from Marseilles, announcing its decision to boycott "all meetings and convocations" until further notice.
Staff will not be putting in Sunday or holiday hours if the October ones are not settled in December, and the same goes for overtime, threatens the Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne trade union.
At a time when our goals and responsibilities are being expanded, but our staff numbers are not, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff's salaries, judges the CGT-pénitentiaire de Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, with some being worse off than others.
But in any case, the balance is not there, observes Jean-François Forget, general secretary of UFAP.
For Christmas, Obama says he gives "nicer stuff" than he receives
The American President, Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first family Christmas at the White House, intimates to TV icon Oprah Winfrey that he has one simple rule when it comes to presents: "I give nicer stuff than I get".
In a special programme to be broadcast on the ABC channel on Sunday evening, the president and his wife, Michelle, offer an insight into the way they plan to celebrate the end of year festivities in their prestigious new home.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged friend, will be joining in.
Santa Claus loves Bo too, maintains Michelle Obama, adding that the dog would "naturally" have a present, according to the programme's advertising trailer.
And Michelle Obama feigned indignance, countering her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: "No way; I gave you good gifts last year", she teased the President.
Absolutely, he had to concede before jokingly retorting: "Who gave you this?", pointing at the First Lady's pearl necklace.
During this hour-long light-hearted programme with the famous presenter, who was a fervent Barack Obama supporter during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also recalled their favourite childhood presents.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-speed bicycle, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father, whom he had rarely seen, had given him for Christmas.
I remember a time when I met my father, who had come to visit us for Christmas, and he gave me a basketball, said the president.
It was only much later in my life that I realised that he had given me the ball.
The First Lady, for her part, recalled her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organise a house, so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arranging them around the fireplace, but I adored that little dollhouse, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated on, RTL claims he is in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated on in Los Angeles due to significant "lesions" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims that the singer has been placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on in the night between Wednesday and Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors noted "lesions resulting from the operation" for the slipped disc undergone in Paris on November 26th, his press office announced in Paris, adding that the lesions had "warranted a repair operation".
The singer's press office, however, wanted to be reassuring, stating that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be communicated within 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner for the singer's first tour, however, Johnny Hallyday may have been put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It will only be in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the state of the patient, once he has at least one eye open, added RTL.
When questioned by the AFP, the press office neither confirmed, nor commented on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to certain sources", no drain was fitted after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on for a slipped disc at the international clinic at Parc Monceau.
The operation, scheduled several days in advance, had been carried out by the neuro-surgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in artist circles.
He was not available to comment on RTL's information on Thursday evening.
Following the operation that he carried out on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was taken on Monday to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital for an infection stemming from the operation.
The singer, Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad patch", but assured everyone that he had "no worries" about the rocker, who is a "fighter".
He had called me just before leaving for Los Angeles, and I told him that it was crazy, because taking a 12-hour flight after that kind of operation is not realistic, said Eddy Mitchell.
Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, had wanted to be reassuring, stating that Johnny Hallyday "was reacting satisfactorily to the antibiotics" and that the infection was being "contained".
Mr. Camus had also said to have spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and not to have noticed any signs of worry.
But health problems for the singer have only multiplied since he was hospitalised for nine days in July after a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the surprise of all, Johnny Hallyday had revealed having had a "minor colonic cancer" operation, then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", billed as his final goodbye tour.
However, since then, every health problem is heavily commented on. Fans and reporters have noticed the singer's trouble in moving around on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny further hospitalisation.
Euro-2009/short course: Bousquet's first in his lucky distance
The Frenchman, Frédérick Bousquet, triple medal-holder in the long course 2009 World Championship, pulled off an international title for a distance he particularly favours, the 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 short course event in Istanbul on Thursday.
The first day of this competition, where full-length swimsuits are permitted for the last time, has seen only three world records beaten, whereas a wave of them was expected.
One record was improved on by the Hungarian, Evelyn Verraszto, 200m medly, and the two others by Russia in the 4x50m medly relay.
A regret for Bousquet, who had his sight set on the 50m freestyle world record, for which he holds the long course title (20.94).
In one of the two high-profile swimming events, the 50m freestyle, it was the 28-year-old Frenchman who made his mark with a time of 20.53 in a final, where ten swimmers started instead of the usual eight - a first at the international level.
Bousquet bested the Croat, Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian, Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not manage to reduce the world record time (20.30) as he had envisaged.
One can always dream of better, and I had actually stated that, if the world record was in my reach, I would certainly attempt it.
Like Bousquet, the vast majority of swimmers were in polyurethane swimsuits, which will not be permitted starting the 1st of January.
Having unleashed 238 world records since February 2008, these swimsuits will end their epic story in Istanbul, which had also seen the first ones in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of these swimsuits did not assist the German, Rome's long course two-time world champion this summer, Paul Biedermann, on this occasion, where world records were at stake.
The young swimmer did not succeed in reducing the record he currently holds in the 400m freestyle (3:32.77), but did, nevertheless, make an impression by achieving his second personal best time (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian, Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dane, Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I did not give it my all in this race.
I knew that I could not achieve a world record, but I managed to defend my title and have accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a strong rival in the future, explained Biedermann.
USA: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola fetches 1.5 million USD
A Roman sarcophagus panel, which had notably belonged to the French writer, Emile Zola, fetched 1.5 million dollars on Thursday, a significantly higher figure than was estimated, announced art auction house Sotheby's.
This front panel, measuring two metres in length and 63cm in height, dating back to the 3rd century AD, was valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble "depicting four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes, is a rare piece; there are only five of them in the world", Florent Heintz, vice-president of art auctions for Roman and Egyptian antiquities, had explained to the AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among around a hundred other lots.
The auction is still going on, but this lot is certainly the one, which has got buyers bidding most so far, commented Sotheby's spokesman to the AFP, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of Emile Zola's acquisition of this marble piece dates back some time.
The panel remained in the famous collection of the Borghese family in Rome for nearly 300 years, then it successively appeared with the French actress, Cécile Sorel, who had made it a feature of her bathroom in her private Paris mansion, then Paul Reynaud, a minister in France's 3rd Republic and briefly the Council's chairman before Marshal Pétain's accession to power.
That left a grey area of about fifty years.
By searching the Louvre Museum's database, Florent Heintz discovered that the panel was part of an "Emile Zola inheritance" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the series of "Rougon-Macquart" novels.
Zelaya's departure attempt from Honduras to Mexico aborted
Mexico judged on Thursday that conditions were no longer suitable for the transfer into its territory of the deposed Honduran president, Manuel Zelaya, who had been refused safe passage by the coup-installed Government.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation in the night with president Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the potential options for carrying out this transfer are not suitable, declared the Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
Having arrived on Wednesday in El Salvador to bring back Mr. Zelaya, the Mexican Government plane returned to its original location, according to a source from the General Directorate of Migrations.
The Coup Government had wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "resign" and had requested a foreign asylum to allow him safe passage to.
But the president refused, because he wanted to travel to Mexico as the incumbent Head of State and an invited guest.
The Coup Government "has again met with failure by wanting me to give up my duties (...); they wanted me to resign", Mr. Zelaya told radio Globo on Thursday, through which he often makes himself heard, since the beginning of the political crisis, which has so far lasted five months in this country of Central America.
I could stay here ten years, I have my guitar here, added the deposed president while playing a few chords, having taken refuge at the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa for the last two and a half months.
The Mexican Embassy presented us with a request for safe passage, but, unfortunately, we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum request, the Coup Government Interior Minister, Oscar Raul Matute, had declared on Wednesday on Honduran HRN radio.
I am not requesting asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview on the Telesur channel, based in Caracas.
Any departure from Honduras would have to be as the president of the Honduran people, he had emphasised.
The rumours of Mr. Zelaya's departure had, on Wednesday, mobilised the partisans of the deposed president, who gathered around the Brazilian Embassy, where military forces reinforced their position.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticised the Coup Government's position.
This demonstrates the marginal character of this Government in relation with international standards, he asserted.
Zelaya, who had become closer with the socialist Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, had been overturned on June 28th, the day he had organised a public consultation to prepare for his re-election, going against the views of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he had made a surprise return on September 21st and had taken refuge at the Brazilian Embassy.
If he comes out, he will be arrested to answer to charges of "high treason", which the Law accuses him of, according to the Coup Government.
The Coup President, Roberto Micheletti, has managed to organise a presidential election on the 29th of November to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected in the controversial vote, which was recognised by the United States, but was contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina, and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted by a landslide against Mr. Zelaya's return to power for the remainder of his term up to January 27th.
Wall Street rises, the commercial balance of the US feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange finished higher on Thursday, as American commercial equilibrium figures indicate a return of activity in the United States and with its partners: the Dow gained 0.67%, and the NASDAQ 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 68.78 points to 10 405.83 points, and the NASDAQ, with a technology dominance, rose by 7.13 points to 2 190.06 points.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index had a result of 0.58% (6.40 points) taking it to 1 102.35 points.
We have good news coming from various sides of the Economy, assessed Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal evidence, she cautioned, suggesting the market was focusing on "the glass being half full".
Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners thinks that investors have concentrated particularly on America's commercial balance figures, "which show an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The US commercial deficit dropped by 7.6% in October, compared to September, to 32.9 billion dollars.
Analysts were expecting the opposite, a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the increase in trade volumes, especially in the export of goods, which reflects the economical growth of the commercial partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell from the research company Economy.com.
In contrast, new unemployment claims in the United States have increased beyond all expectations in the past week, to reach 474 000 claims.
However, in the last four weeks, the average number of new employment seekers "has fallen to its lowest in a year", highlighted Scott Marcouiller from Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
Treasury 10-year bond yields have grown to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday evening, and 30-year bond yields are at 4.492% against 4.408% the previous evening.
Cuba: hundreds of Government supporters speak out against the "Ladies in White"
Several hundred Cuban pro-government demonstrators spoke out on Thursday against political prisoners' wives, who had gathered in Havana for International Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration, for which around a dozen dissidents were arrested.
Around forty "White Ladies", wives and those close to the political prisoners, were jeered at in the street by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they were marching towards the centre of the capital to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, observed an AFP reporter.
Down with the Yanks!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the Revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" the pro-government supporters chanted at the dissidents, their fists raised.
These latter were escorted by plainclothes agents, who had come to "ensure their protection".
The previous evening, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "Ladies in White" in Havana without anyone being injured or arrested.
However, in the Vedado district of Havana, a dozen dissidents, who were also preparing to demonstrate Thursday for the International Human Rights Day, were arrested by plainclothes police, reported an AFP journalist.
The policemen made the dissidents, who had been jeered at by pro-government supporters, get into unmarked vehicles, according to the journalist.
Dissident arrests under similar circumstances normally only last a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize from the European Parliament, the "Ladies in White" had organised a non-authorised march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", totalling 200 according to the dissident side, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, is serving a 20-year sentence in prison.
Mr. Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of which remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opposition as "mercenaries" or "agents" on the books of their sworn enemy, the United States.
Unusually, Cuban television covered the demonstration of pro-government supporters against the "anti-revolutionaries" on Thursday.
Cuba, lead by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of flouting rights and liberties, notably those of the freedom of expression.
A madman kills an eighty-year-old with a knife and wounds 5 at Clichy-la-Garenne
A crazed man armed with two knives has killed a man in his eighties and wounded five other people in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), during rush hour, towards the end of Thursday.
We have learned from witnesses and from police that, according to the investigation's initial findings, the attacker, aged 28, appears to have struck an eighty-year-old with two knives for reasons that remain unclear, in or at the front of a pharmacy at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaurès.
Having sustained severe wounds, the elderly man, born in 1929 according to the police union, Alliance, died from his injuries in the hospital.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then began attacking a couple, including a pregnant woman.
The husband, aged around thirty, came between them and was wounded.
The first two victims, gravely wounded, were admitted to the hospital, where the eighty-year-old man died.
The days of the other injured person may be numbered, as vital organs have apparently been affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman was subsequently taken ill and was hospitalised "in a state of shock", according to one police source.
The armed man, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, fled into the street along Boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He is reported to have wounded two passers-by, apparently at random: one thirty-year-old, and one forty-year-old, the latter severely.
By the evening, the scenario remained unclear.
He was armed with two butcher's knives that he carried crossed on his back, explained Arnaud Pressé at the scene, an officer from the Alliance union of Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passers-by, including some youngsters, attempted to overpower the madman, according to witness reports collected by the AFP.
I saw a guy of about thirty with a green jacket.
Three youths tried to intervene.
They could not manage it, because the guy was well-built, recounted Alberto, a server in a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a town policeman, who broke his wrist, he added.
Still on Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, outside number 61, two town policemen, one of whom was the chief, attempted to arrest the armed man and were injured by punches, according to police sources.
The events took place on one of Clichy-la-Garenne's main streets, where many local businesses operate.
Some passers-by came to tell me that there was someone injured outside.
I went out, saw a 70-year-old on the ground, put the person in the recovery position, then I noticed a severe wound on the abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person arrived, aged around thirty, with knife wounds.
National police officers were the ones who arrested the man, who was not carrying any identification documents.
The case will be brought to the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office by the region's police service for Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The madman was taken to a hospital on Thursday evening.
He had not yet had a chance to speak after being taken into custody.
A police source did not exclude the possibility of him being committed to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six policemen were needed to subdue the man at the police station in Clichy, where he was taken.
He was "in a state of hyperexcitement" as are "all crazed people of this kind, whose strength increases tenfold under its effect".
USA: Polanski's lawyer calls afresh for proceedings to be dropped
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish film director, Roman Polanski, called again in Los Angeles on Thursday (California, western United States), for the abandonment of proceedings against his client, who is currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a vice case that is over 30 years old.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of "The Pianist" cited grave errors in the procedures at the time of the events in 1977, in front of three judges at the Court of Appeal of California's second district.
I am calling for charges to be dropped here and now, declared Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of the judge, who was dealing with the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "sends chills down the spine".
According to him, judge Rittenband -- since deceased -- is said to have spoken with one of the prosecutors, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison, before passing sentence -- constituting a serious error in procedure.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", the words coming straight from the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
However, Mr. Wells had eventually declared that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary at the end of September.
In the event of the court's refusal to abandon proceedings, Mr. Hummel called for a trial to be held, which would allow him to present evidence to back his arguments.
The Prosecution, for its part, has re-iterated its argument, already formed in the first instance, that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously looked at while Roman Polanski did not present himself in court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker had fled the United States before his sentence had been passed for "unlawful sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
He has not set foot in the United States since.
The deputy prosecutor for Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, therefore declared that Roman Polanski "must be present at the hearing".
For this case, are we trying to send the message, not just to (Roman Polanski) but also other defendants, that it is ok to flee? asked Mrs. Asayama.
In her view, the filmmaker "is asking a favour from the court, while at the same time showing disregard for its authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to return their verdict -- has also emphasised "that there are other alternatives to fleeing".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to request that proceedings against Roman Polanski be abandoned.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also called once again for an end to the proceedings.
Reminding that her client can no longer stand to be harassed with every resurfacing of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can claim that this was a just procedure.
Thirty two years is enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested on the 26th of September in Switzerland on an American warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was put under house arrest at his chalet in Gstaad, pending his possible extradition.
Wall Street closes without momentum, slowed by a strengthening dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed with no particular heading on Friday, in a market torn between better than expected indicators in the United States and a strengthening dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the NASDAQ dropped 0.03%.
According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 65.67 points to 10 471.50 points, whereas the NASDAQ, with a technology predominance, fell by 0.55 point to 2 190.31 points.
The wider Standard & Poor's 500 has itself advanced by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1 106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very calm, observes Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains within a narrow margin; trading volumes have become very weak, and I think that this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which "have contributed to improving market opinion in relation to the robustness of the economic recovery", summarised Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the United States, retail sales have increased by 1.3% in November, for the second month in a row, and far more than predicted.
Moreover, the confidence of American consumers has clearly bounced back in December, to 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month, according to preliminary estimates from Michigan University's index.
The indices have, however, been slowed by a renewed rise of the dollar, to a new two-month high against the Euro, which "puts downward pressure on the sectors that are sensitive to the economic situation", explained Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank.
Technology securities have thereby lost some ground.
The bond market has fallen.
Treasury 10-year bond yields have grown to 3.540% against 3.482% on Tuesday evening, and 30-year bond yields are at 4.497% against 4.492% the previous evening.
Miss World pageant once again in South Africa
After a month-long trek across South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World are preparing to enter the final straight on Saturday to make their dream come true: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
During this grand beauty congregation organised for the second consecutive year around Johannesburg, five of them have already landed their tickets to the semi-final.
Miss Japan, Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gibraltar, and Yanbing Ma from Canada have been elected Miss World Sportswoman or also Miss World Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
To visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Cape Town is extraordinary.
I saw so many things and I have so much new experience, said Miss of Sierra Leone.
This competition, which is taking place in South Africa for the ninth time, will be transmitted live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I could not have dreamed of a better country to award my crown.
The experience was fascinating.
I am pleased to have been able to live it twice, points out Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second visit to South Africa has been made memorable by the many talks with candidates and the re-discovery "of landscapes in this country that take your breath away".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings, and safaris, the Miss candidates are concentrating on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present at this vote, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom have become stars of Bollywood.
It is the dream of every woman to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not all about appearance.
We are ambassadors for our countries and I want to return home with the crown, asserts Miss India with a broad smile.
According to organisers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
Candidates will parade in traditional outfits and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will be presented by Angela Chow, an ethnic Chinese television presenter, the South African ex-beauty queen Michelle McLean, and an officer from the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa showed that it could welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is difficult to better, affirms Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates went on safari, as they did last year, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bicycle, and sampled the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual for a head of State, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will probably be the World Cup draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for football in June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I have mixed with people I never thought I would be able to approach.
I will without a doubt be returning for the 2010 World Cup, enthuses Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", according to son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", assures his son, David, on Friday arriving at the airport in Los Angeles, where he was to be by his father's bedside, who has been in hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, all will go well, declared his son, David Hallyday, to the Press on leaving the plane from Paris just after 13:00 local time (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son had a relaxed air and assured that he would be heading "without delay" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection stemming from a slipped disc operation on November 26th in Paris.
The singer was "put in an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for comfort reasons, to prevent his suffering, and to allow his treatment to be administered", indicated the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been put in an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for an infection stemming from a slipped disc operation on the 26th of November in Paris.
The singer had to be operated on in the night from Wednesday to Thursday because of significant lesions resulting from the operation.
His wife, Laeticia, went on Friday morning to the Los Angeles French High School, where their daughter Jade is enrolled, to attend a school performance, observed an AFP photographer.
The Head of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery of the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to see the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer vehemently brought into question Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neuro-surgeon, who operated on the singer on the 26th of November at the International Clinic of Parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was carnage.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were aghast, declared Mr. Camus.
I heard talk of possible legal proceedings to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus reckoned that Johnny Hallyday had "left far too soon for Los Angeles, with the Paris surgeon's authorisation".
I had this doctor on the phone in person, and he assured me that there was no problem for this trip, which shocked me, as I, myself, have had two slipped discs, he added.
Shortly before, on RTL, he had indicated that the singer apparently "had left without a drain or anything", following his Paris operation.
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well-known in artistic circles.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated on the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a haematoma, following a cerebral haemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a notorious reputation, convicted by the Law on several occasions, in cases of medical liability, as well as for fraud and tax evasion.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer for the Doctors' governing body, accused him of being "a man without scruples", who "regularly" has to answer to the governing body's Council, and who is "far from reputable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made an announcement on Friday through his solicitor, David Koubbi.
The latter indicated that the operation had "gone perfectly well" and that post-operation tests returned "normal".
The operation "was not haemorrhagic and therefore did not required a drain to be fitted", he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, for whom health problems have been multiplying since the summer, would seem to be on hold.
Clearly, resuming the tour on the 8th of January [in Amiens] as planned seems very soon, declared Mr. Camus.
The UDF alliance speaks out and orders the New Centre party to stop using its acronym
The UDF alliance, controlled by François Bayrou's Democratic Movement (MoDem), reacted on Friday to the buy-out bid made by the New Centre's president, Hervé Morin, for the acronym of the former Giscardian party, by ordering him not to use it under any circumstances, threatening legal action otherwise.
Hervé Morin announced publicly that he intended to recoup the UDF acronym, ruling that François Bayrou was not worthy of its political heritage, having extended his hand to the Left.
The Defence Minister, whose party is partner to the UMP, had in fact planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC's national Council.
In support of his move, he received backing from deputy Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP switched to NC), who claims his ownership of the UDF trademark by being the first to record it in 2004 at the National Industrial Property Institute.
However, Friday evening, the UDF Alliance's office, headed by François Bayrou's friends, who do not plan to give up possession, has come out of silence to launch an attack against the deputy, ordering him not to use the acronym, and to transfer the trademark's ownership to them, otherwise threatening legal action.
In the last few days, you have stepped up the number of declarations indicating that you were going to propose political action to regain the UDF acronym, the alliance writes in a communication signed by 19 out of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from the MoDem, as well as the senator, Jean Arthuis, from the centre Alliance.
You also thought it acceptable to include in your campaign literature and on your website's homepage the movement's name, the New Centre, and to follow it with the slogan: today's UDF, remark those who signed the document.
As you are well aware, you have no right to the use of the acronym, explains the UDF's office, requiring that the NC remove "immediately any mention of the UDF name from all material, and from (their) internet site".
He also requests that Hervé de Charette "transfer ownership of the trademark to its rightful owners".
If you failed to do this, the matter would be referred to the courts to ensure that the Law and the legitimate rights of UDF members were respected, warn the document's signatories.
In their communication, they specify that the UDF "is a political movement in its own right since 1978" and points out that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made their choice" to leave him in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to establish the UMP".
The New Centre, according to them, has therefore no right to the use of the UDF acronym (Union for French Democracy).
They also remind that the UDF's last assembly voted in 2007 for its union with the MoDem for three years, and for the creation of an office charged with defending "the material and moral interests" of the body founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the trademark", he had "not been a UDF member for three years", but, in fact, with the UMP.
He is profiting in a scandalous and fraudulent manner from the absence of a registered trademark for the UDF acronym by taking it to benefit his own account.
This incident is turning into a major offence, they state, before adding ironically about the NC's strategy that: "in our opinion, in politics as in real life, it is more dignified to make one's own name rather than try to become somebody by fraudulently acquiring a name we have no right to".
Liliane Bettencourt Case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for "abuse of weakness"
The Nanterre tribunal decided on Friday to bring François-Marie Banier to trial to ascertain whether, as the daughter of billionairess Liliane Bettencourt is accusing him, he profited from the eighty-year-old's weakened mental state to despoil her of some of her fortune.
The photographer, 62, known for his photographs of the stars, will be tried on the 15th and 16th of April 2010 for "abuse of weakness", an offence that carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a 375 000 euro fine.
The decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in this case, which is turning into a worthy family saga involving one of the richest families in France, where mother and daughter are torn apart, while at the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
However, the 15th Magistrate's Court has also ordered a combined expert medical opinion of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87, to be led by three doctors.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such an exam, at least not with the conditions proposed by the Nanterre court at the time of the investigation.
The doctors nominated on Friday will have to submit a report by the 10th of March, 2010, stating, in particular, whether Liliane Bettencourt could have found herself in a weakened state and at which times.
I think she will submit to it.
I will talk with her about it, declared Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, at the exit of the hearing.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, congratulated himself on the court's decision.
It is excellent news (…) The expert opinion will prove that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady, whom we should be protecting, he affirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's daughter and only child has engaged in taking to court the case against François-Marie Banier, the photographer and all-round artist, whom she accuses of profiting for years from her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts, or works of art.
As far as she is concerned, Liliane Bettencourt has always refuted having been manipulated by the photographer, who she considers a long-standing friend.
As the court on Friday was due to examine the admissibility of the case brought by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the pleas from the lawyers at times turned proceedings into an unveiling of intimate family matters.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer cited three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003, and 2005) to her solicitor, in which she expressed having suspicions about Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter dated from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Mr. Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years."
I have been unable to speak to Françoise since her marriage".
For its part, the Court in Nanterre has again ruled that the plaintiff's claim was not admissible for action, all the more so after a judge supervising guardianship refused her request in the past few days to initiate a procedure allowing legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully capable of participating in legal proceedings, she is not under protection and does not have a guardian.
Nobody needs to act on her behalf", affirms the Public Prosecution's representative, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The Court determined that it would make a ruling once the case concerning the admissibility of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers's claim had taken place.
A management revolution or the end of competitive intelligence?
If nothing changes in the way France's biggest enterprises are run, our fight for the development of competitive intelligence will have been in vain…
For over ten years, the Management's attitude in large enterprises towards their employees reflects the position of enterprises and their consumers before the marketing revolution: employees should be made to adhere to "values" dictated from above just as it was in the past, when products dreamed up by the factory's engineers were dropped on the consumer.
By placing the consumer at the heart of the organisation, the marketing revolution put the strategies for conquering markets the right way up again... even if authoritarian temptation to impose products, which are disconnected from the preferences of the consumer tend to resurface regularly!
A demobilisation of employees can lead to terminal demoralisation.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the visible part of a far more widespread problem that affects management employees in particular.
Demobilisation gravely compromises the development of an organisation's strategic functions, notably in R&D, but even more so in competitive intelligence.
Indeed, CI "demands from all sides concerned (...) a proactive approach and a long-term vision"; it requires from employees a commitment that is entirely contradicted by authoritarian management methods.
For this reason, we are calling for a management revolution, which would consist in placing employees at the centre of an enterprise's concerns alongside consumers.
The very relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys - such as those given by Orange to its employees - stimulate this revolution in managerial methods?
Unfortunately, I fear it will not.
- Firstly, because I have witnessed that, when faced with a new situation, any organisation will arrive, after many detours, at doing chiefly... what it always does!
- Next, because authoritarianism - a disease of power - grows proportionally with the magnitude of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
Coming from the top technical educational establishments, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the old behaviourist theory, which has recently been re-awakened by the "neuro-sciences" of the United States that have been widely and silently diffused by business institutes and the Media.
In this way, by suggesting that "levers" [sic] can be pulled for the commitment of management staff, a recent Ipsos survey published on Figaro.fr cradles leaders into a position of mechanistic governance, which is unsuited to the world of today.
Identify and quantify mobilisation factors
In contrast, the management revolution needed for the correct functioning of modern enterprises supposes the adoption of a finalistic vision of human behaviour.
It consists in the integration, within all management strategies and practices, of a fundamental admission: for employees, commitment to the enterprise is only possible if it is clearly perceived as a means to realising a part of their dreams, their ambitions, and their plans.
Currently, only studies produced through motivation factor analysis adopt the concept of employee motivation.
These studies have demonstrated that they form a view of their organisation based on a pre-determined consensus of opinion, which allows them, by means of this perceived view, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life plans.
By identifying and gauging these mobilisation factors, enterprise leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and turn their management of resources "the right way round".
They thereby create a favourable terrain for the concerted development of robust and effective competitive intelligence.
Oslo speech: the "just war" earns Obama praise from the Right
The American Right paid tribute to the speech given the previous evening in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 had defended the concept of a "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives, who had mocked the awarding of the Prize to Obama on October 9th, were this time giving the presidential speech their applause, lead by Sarah Palin, former vice-president candidate during the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, declared Mrs. Palin, right-wing champion of the Republican party, to the daily newspaper USA Today, adding that she had herself touched on the topic of war that is "sometimes necessary" in her memoirs, which have just been published.
War is, of course, one of the last things, which Americans want to get involved in, but it is necessary.
We must stop these terrorists over there, she affirmed.
Mr. Obama, who has inherited the two wars from his predecessor, George W. Bush, in Iraq and Afghanistan, applied himself on Thursday in Oslo to justifying resorting to force, a way to explain his decision to send 30 000 additional troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another one of Mr. Obama's opponents, Newt Gingrich, concluded that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found his speech to be really very good, approved the former Speaker in the House of Representatives, who had particularly valued the mention that "Evil does exist in the world" in the presidential discourse.
From certain viewpoints, I found this speech to be of historic significance, declared Mr. Gingrich, during an interview for the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former representative, considered by some a possible candidate for the Republican inauguration of the 2012 presidential elections, was delighted to see "a president from the Left" remind the Noble Committee members "that they would not be free and in a position to award a peace prize if resorting to force had not been an option".
For Michael Gerson, a former writer for George W. Bush and re-converted columnist for the Washington Post, Mr. Obama has given "a very American speech".
As well as presenting himself as a "world citizen", as "he always does", "he spoke like an American President", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble, which they did not create and they are doing little to preserve", declared Mr. Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced right-wingers, a hawkish character from the Bush era, the former UN ambassador, John Bolton, described the speech as "drab, turgid, and uninspired" on the National Review Online's website.
To the president's left, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify resorting to force.
When we wrap war inside the notion of justice, the massacre of innocent people can easily be justified, he warned.
Centre-left Press nevertheless remained full of praise for the president.
The Los Angeles Times, still of the opinion that the Nobel Prize had been prematurely awarded to Mr. Obama, described his address as "a blockbuster", even for a speaker that is known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a roadmap for guiding international decisions made on conflicts, poverty and oppression", enthused the Californian newspaper.
Mr. Obama "made the speech that was needed", reports the New York Times, judging it "both sombre and edifying".
Road freight: three marathons for one agreement to save Christmas deliveries
Following three marathon sessions of negotiations, transport unions and the TLF, the only employer's organisation to have remained to the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that will end the strike order and the threat on Christmas deliveries.
During the signing on Friday evening, Transport Secretary Dominique Bussereau was "delighted" with the agreement after several rounds of negotiations on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, negotiating sides left in the small hours with the hope of a swift signing of the agreement's text later in the morning.
And this, despite three employers' organisations (FNTR, UNOSTRA, OTRE) having slammed the door.
However, it took a further six hours from a meeting that started at 11am for everyone to be in agreement, and for the text to be signed at 6pm.
The disagreement "would have been very damaging for the companies" and "it looked like it might threaten the end of year festivities", Mr. Bussereau stated.
The document allows for a 4% increase in salaries for the lowest ones (in local and regional road transport), and a 2.9% increase for higher ones (international transport).
Hourly rates, for those on lower pay, "go from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It is not much, but we have come a long way, explains Patrice Clos (Worker's Union).
This evening we will give the order to our campaigners not to form blockades or picket at delivery depots.
There may, however, always be a few difficult ones, who remain uncooperative, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, paid tribute to "a good agreement", even if it was "difficult to concede the increases on the higher salaries given international competition".
According to him, the increases will be of the order of 170 euros per month for the lower salaries and from 100 to 120 euros for the higher ones.
It is a common sense agreement, respecting the workers, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) praised it as "a historic agreement".
As for Richard Jaubert (CGT), he described it as "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also allows for a rise in travel expenses of 3% and maintaining current general road transport conditions for the first half of 2010, which will give room for dealing with the questions of a 13th month's pay and the modernisation of the collective labour agreement.
Mr. Bussereau reminded everyone that "a 100 million euro cut in employers' charges" had been the subject of a Government amendment in corrective financial legislation for 2009, voted on in the night from Thursday to Friday at the National Assembly.
The Government will ask that the Senate vote on it "in the same timeframe".
The signature from the TLF allows the agreement to be applied in the first instance to all the companies that are members of the organisation, and secondly, to the whole profession, subject to it being extended by the Minister for Labour.
It will be done "in a very short time", assures Mr. Bussereau.
The opposing employers' organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR called it a "sham", because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector in compensation for part of the carbon tax".
The Transport Secretary urgently forced us to the negotiating table, not with the aim of a two-sided review, but to avoid upsetting the turkey-eaters this Christmas, deplores the UNOSTRA.
For the OTRE, the agreement risks "digging the graves of a large number of the sector's SMEs over the next 12 months".
RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions unhappy with RATP proposals
Disruptions on the RER A, the largest urban public transport link in France, are set to continue over the weekend, as a meeting on Friday, the second day of strikes, between the unions and the RATP management have left their pay demands unmet.
Saturday and Sunday, on this critical weekend of shopping before Christmas, trains will only run between the hours of 10am and 8pm, with just one out of two trains running on the central stretch (between La Défense and Nation), and one out of four outside the central section.
The operation of the interchange with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Préfecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, who welcome 200 000 customers every day, were delighted by the fact that "the RATP is making efforts to assist the department stores".
The RER A runs through the Parisian conurbation from West to East.
The RATP segment runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, approximately one out of two trains ran at peak times, with almost no trains at all during off-peak periods, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no trouble with crowds on the platforms, as Parisians had gotten themselves organised.
Thus, in the early hours, the station at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less busy than usual, notably because of the absence of school and college students.
At Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had gotten up "an hour and a half earlier, to be sure of arriving on time".
The Saint-Lazare station did not see any overcrowding, the SNCF stated, having planned for additional support staff and police officers.
The RER A trains operated by the SNCF to or from Cergy-Le-Haut were departing or arriving from Saint-Lazare station, where they link with the metro.
New general meetings for strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will review the results, seen as "poor" by the unions, of a meeting with Management held on Friday afternoon.
The RER's director proposes to negotiate a specific agreement for the RER A on all aspects, working hours, career paths, etc…
It is not what the drivers, who are demanding the bonus they are owed, want, according to Thierry Garon (SUD).
The RATP has even put its offer of bonuses on hold, the CGT complained, pointing out that the management "could not be bothered to resolve the problem, whereas road transport and the SNCF both have it done and dusted".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a wider review of the conditions of practice for the profession", the RATP elaborated.
Prompting the unions to remark further that the company "did not care about its weekend passengers".
During the morning, some 150 drivers invaded a works council meeting at the company's seat in Paris.
That is when Management, which had until then refused to enter into any discussions during the strike, had suggested the meeting "in a motion to calm the situation".
The dispute is threatening to extend to RER B on Tuesday, following the submission of an advance notice by the UNSA and the Indépendants groups.
The unions are demanding a bonus of 120 euros (UNSA) to 150 euros, with a 30-euro variable band (CGT, FO, CFDT, SUD, Indépendants) and are complaining of the deterioration in work conditions on this line serving a million passengers every day.
The RER drivers, all in the later stages of their careers, are paid a gross salary of 2200 to 2700 euros as well as 600 to 650 euros of bonus pay for split shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice bans the pro-Kurd party, a decision laden with consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court returned a verdict on Friday for the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurd party, a decision which was immediately followed by angry protests within the Kurdish community in the Southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
The decision is likely to greatly complicate the Government's work, as it has just recently made positive gestures towards the Kurdish community in an attempt to resolve a 25-year old conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was disbanded because it had become "a hotbed of damaging activities against the State's independence and its unfailing unity", the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, declared to the press at the end of four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a majority of seven was sufficient to force the disbanding, Mr. Kiliç indicated, adding that 37 of the party's representatives, including its president, Ahmet Türk, and the deputy, Aysel Tugluk, have been banished from political life for the next five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity, from which both Mr. Türk and Mrs. Tugluk benefited, and the confiscation of party assets by the Treasury.
The DTP occupies 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned prior to the verdict that the representatives would leave Parliament rather than take their seats as representatives with no affiliation.
The decision was taken following proceedings launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Appeal Court, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying "directives" from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered to be a terrorist organisation by Ankara and in many countries.
Many observers believe the DTP serves as a legal political shop window for the PKK rebels.
The party maintains, however, that it has "no organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to recognise it as a terrorist organisation and is calling for the Government to open negotiations with it.
The court's verdict comes at a time when the Government has extended its hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures, reinforcing its rights in an attempt to quash Kurdish support for the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
DTP leaders had stated that a dissolution of the party could lead to renewed tensions in the Anatolian Southeast, where a great number of protests against the terms for the detention of the PKK's head, Abdullah Öcalan, have degenerated into clashes with police in the last few weeks.
As soon as the Law made its announcement, a thousand protesters gathered before the DTP's buildings in Diyarbakir, the Southeast's main city, populated mainly by Kurds.
Police forces fired tear-gas grenades and used water cannons, as demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails and stones with slings.
Around a hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
Following the verdict, Mr. Türk declared that the Law's decision would "deepen the despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this [Kurdish] issue by banning a party, he told the Press.
The Government, a party rooted in Islamic influences, also condemned the decision.
We are opposed on principle to the closing down of parties.
It does not solve anything, declared the Energy Minister, Taner Yildiz.
This decision puts a blowtorch to the Government's democratic olive branch, comments political analyst Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers in the North of Turkey three days earlier, one of the bloodiest in the last few months.
The snow can come
A really hard, frosty winter, that is what Wolfgang Brauburger is wishing for.
Not because he wants to make a laughing stock of people, says the the head of the FES winter road maintenance service.
But so that his employees can try out and learn every facit of their vehicle's technology.
This may be the case for the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of the snow and ice.
Here, the FES is proceeding according to a precise plan.
As soon as Frankfurt is blanketed in snow and the temperatures drop below zero, 20 so-called "A Routes" are serviced by large-scale distribution vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include, for instance, main traffic roads and through roads, such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstrasse.
But also fire roads, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and roads with slopes, such as Atzelbergstrasse.
The service of the FES starts at three in the morning
The approx. 1,040 km would, if necessary, have to be gritted with wet salt, which has better adhesive properties, within no more than three hours.
That is why the FES start at three in the morning, "so the routes are free by the time commuter traffic starts".
It becomes difficult when it only begins snowing at 7.30 am.
Then we are faced with a problem, says the head of the winter road service, "because nobody is prepared to make way for the gritting vehicles".
Only then, unless it continues to snow, is it the turn of approach and connecting roads, which also include Rat-Beil-Strasse.
The last priority are quiet side and minor roads.
That is where complaints are made, knows Brauburger.
At five in the morning, the footmen of the FES set to work, and dangerous areas and passages are cleared.
The FES can usually not attend to all bike routes.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps an eye on the bridges, in particular from 10 pm until 4.30 am, says Brauburger.
As slippery ice quickly forms on them, the gritter sets off as soon as temperatures drop below two degrees centigrade.
Where required, it is also called out by the police.
The cradle of the dinosaurs
Tawa Hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal, standing two metres tall and with a length of 1.50 metres on two strong hind legs, had a longish skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, it would not be anything special.
But Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with such physical features, reports Sterling Nesbitt and his colleagues at the University of Texas in Austin in Science magazine of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years in what is today New Mexico, which was back then in a dry zone of the super continent Pangaea at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It reveals a great deal about the relationships, the spread, and the features of early dinosaurs.
In 2006 Nesbitt and the other palaeontologists started an excavation on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
"On some days we found dozen dinosaur bones, that is exemplary for sediments from the Triassic period," reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
The scientists identified some bones quickly.
During the excavations, they collected the remains of a total of five creatures.
Find confirms theories on early dinosaur history
The name Tawa comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an exceptional find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic period are extremely rare. Mostly, only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur researchers do not quite share this enthusiasm.
"This find is not particularly spectacular, but it does confirm some theories on the early history of dinosaurs." says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, for instance.
According to current doctrine, the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, for which reason the classification of these primal dinosaurs is highly contentious.
As such, the experts debated, for instance, when the saurians split into the three most important lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and birds, the four-legged sauropods known as the "long necks" and their relatives, and the plant-eating Ornithischiae (bird-hipped saurians), which included, for instance, the Triceratops and Stegosaurus species.
According the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is a primal theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa Hallae, for instance, the scientists found indications of air bags, as the descendants of the theropods, birds, have.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
Tawa Hallae's bones of the spine were obviously also partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
As the related line of the huge sauropods later also had air bags and lightweight bones, the joint ancestor of these two groups will probably have come up with this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
As the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the scientists come to the conclusion that the saurians appeared there first.
Accordingly, the three lines of development separated early on and spread from South America across all parts of the planet, which still formed a single land mass as the super continent Pangaea.
This theory is backed up by the fact that the team found two more theropods which are not particularly closely related along with the remains of Tawa Hallae.
The three cannot possibly descend from a common ancestor. So they must have migrated there, is the scientists argument.
We believe that there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the Science study.
But there are of course contradictions.
An older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of the dinosaurs, lived in what is today Poland, says the Bonn-based palaeontologist Martin Sander.
He believes that a distorted picture may emerge simply because a high number of primitive dinosaur fossils have survived over the years, while there is hardly anything to be found on other continents.
How dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sidearm of the reptile tree to become the ruling tetrapod vertebrate of the Mesozoic, is still anybody's guess.
During the Triassic period, the dinosaurs still shared their habitat with a large amount of other reptiles, for instance with the ancestors of today's crocodile and pterosaurs and with numerous other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic period, the dinosaurs spread across the globe and developed many new species, while their relatives died out on the threshold from the Triassic to the Jurassic periods.
Success story did not last for ever
There are two theories to explain this switch, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a case of mass dying, which the dinosaurs randomly survived but not the other reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs were better adjusted, meaning that they were able to beat off the competition.
In any event, the success story did not last for ever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped a group of animals, which had also developed back in the Triassic period and since lived in the shadows to blossom: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories international.
Professors of Toronto University are on it, as are those from the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna and Berkeley in California.
Lecturers from Naples are included, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The vacation by the police of the Casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University is having repercussions throughout the world.
278 professors and teaching assistants of the Goethe University, but also of colleges from all over Germany, Europe and North and South America are showing their solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in both German and English, they "condemn" the police action initiated by the executive committee.
University president Werner Müller-Estler had the building seized by students and assistant professors on strike last week, because walls and objects of art had been besmirched.
Five students were hurt in the action.
The material damage, the signatories argue, does not justify "the forceful dissolution of self-organised courses of students and lecturers by a police commando unit".
The vacation represents "an inacceptable infringement" on the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "to deligitimise and criminalise the protest" and distracts from the matter.
The executive committee has refused to enter into the necessary discourse.
The teaching staff demand the immediate termination of the criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the damage to property, read the statement.
Protest legitimised
The youth ranks of the Verdi Union and the German Association of Unions are also showing their solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for their own future, says Verdi State Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hesse's Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), however, supported the approach of the university president and police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are absolutely inacceptable means, the said in a topical session on Thursday in the Wiesbaden parliament.
We have sympathy for the protest, but cannot accept vandalism, said the CDU parliament member Peter Beuth.
A different stance was taken by the opposition parties - the SPD, Greens and Left Party.
The CDU is taking besmirched walls as the pretext to criminalise the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left Party).
Instead of taking the students' arguments and students seriously, they organised this vacation.
The Left Party has filed an application calling on the Minister of Internal Affairs to report on the police action.
A new Silicon Valley
For many years, it was a secret city, inaccessible to Westerners.
Zelenograd, one of ten districts in the capital Moscow, was a highly guarded location for secret arms research during the Soviet Union.
Nowadays, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from Moscow centre is regarded as Russia's Silicon Valley.
Important research and production facilities for micro and nano technology are located here.
In September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd made contacts with the Frankfurt science centre in Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several visits, and on Wednesday Zelenograd and Riedberg finally signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt on Wednesday.
The Moscow Deputy Mayor, Yuri Roslyak, and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Zelenograd led the Russian delegation and Economic Affairs Head Edwin Schwarz signed on behalf of Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and small- and medium-sized companies focusing on research in natural science will travel to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
The idea is to establish continuous scientific exchange.
But business relations are also being eyed.
Companies of the FIZ will have the option to get a foothold in the growing Russian market.
In turn, Russian businesses want to win orders in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters to the most important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for instance, the Moscow Institute of Electrophysics, and major companies such as Sitronics and Rossiyskaya Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (verbatim "green city") got its name from the wooded hills where the research facilities are located.
A Stuttgart brake block
The impact and dimensions of Stuttgart 21 cannot be overestimated.
For its supporters, the project deals no less than with the "new heart of Europe".
Quite rightly so. S21 is far more than lowering a railway station, more than a gigantic construction project, which will plunge the city of the Baden-Württemberg state capital into a terrible chaos of building sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 warn born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminus stations with rails ending in the middle of towns were regarded as fossils of the 19th century in terms of traffic technology, which acted like brake blocks to contemporary rail traffic, as it used to take an awful lot of time to shift engines from back to front.
Pull in, stop briefly, pull out - that's the plan.
And therefore, terminus stations were supposed to disappear: as in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a non-terminus station, which is approximately half way along the trans-European rail line between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is actually being built now, although the vision of the 1980s has no longer been compatible with the reality for years.
Even very ambitious planners have recognised that it is virtually unpayable to lower the stations in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria.
Terminus stations also no longer have pulling in and out problems since the development of push-pull trains with railway traction units and control cabs at either end.
And still: Stuttgart 21 along with the new ICE route to Ulm is now being started.
State and municipal politicians have enforced it.
German Rail is participating, also because the risks of the Republic's biggest single infrastructure project will be borne by the taxpayer and not the state company.
As regards urban development, the development can be more or less justified.
An urban area is being created which, if the planners' computer-generated graphics are to be believed, will feature a lot of green.
For the rail traffic system, S21 is damaging.
The non-terminus railway station and the line extension are designed for passenger transportation, which - typical for the 1980s - is estimated to see huge growth.
At the time, there was no competition from no-frills airlines.
Contemporary traffic policy, however, should be prioritising the handling of freight transportation, as transport by rail far more environmentally friendly than by lorry on the road.
But the line to be built is not suitable for freight trains due to steep slopes.
More seriously, S21 also affects many other rail projects.
A good six billion euros are to be buried in the Swabian land.
That is the official figure.
Experts expect ten to fifteen billion to be more realistic.
One thing is for sure, the money will be missing at other nodes and bottlenecks in the network over the next decade.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the transport ministry.
One of the most important ones is to expand the some 180 km of the line through the Rhine valley.
Work has been continuing on the line in slow motion since 1987.
It is urgent to really put the foot down here.
But S21 will act as a brake block.
The Rhine valley line will become a bottleneck for international freight transportation: right in the heart of Europe.
Government reviewing verdict on airport
The state government did not decide in parliament whether it would appeal against the verdict of Hesse's Administrative Court (VGH) to ban night flights.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to review the 400+-page VGH verdict, said economics minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel recently confirmed in writing that the state would have to reorganise the ban on night flights in the event of building the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport.
According to the verdict, the granting of 17 flights between 11 pm and 5 am, as planned by the state government, is not compatible with the protection of the population from flight noise as specified by law.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it will appeal the verdict.
The opposition criticised this delay and called upon the government representatives to do without an appeal before the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD party leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel demanded the CDU and FDP to return to their promises to ban night flights, which they made before the election. Otherwise, this would have to be rated as the "breaking of a promise".
It is bloody difficult when you are allowed to keep one's word, said Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir, alluding to the FDP election slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation from Schäfer-Gümbel that the state government was trying to achieve their night flights by "skewing justice and playing tricks".
A detailed legal examination would take time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of "a brief first impression".
We need a legally compliant decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As presented by the opposition, his party never made any statements regarding the ban on night flights.
US banks repay state support
The crisis-hit US major banks are breaking free from their state shackles.
On Wednesday Bank of America repaid the support from the bank protection fund TARP in the amount USD 45 billion (nearly EUR 30 billion) in one go.
And, according to reports from US broadcaster CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to repay the state support.
The institutions thereby want to wiggle themselves free from the restrictions going hand-in-hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the limits on manager bonuses and the paying of high charges.
Bank of America had raised some USD 19 billion from investors through convertible loans.
The rest of the amount was taken from its own kitty, which was well filled through the sale of business units.
Bank head Kenneth Lewis extended his express thanks to the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The cash injection helped over a very difficult time.
The bank overstretched at the height of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also plans to raise cash on the capital market to free itself from its liabilities with the state.
Already on Thursday, the US bank was able to announce a capital increase of some USD 20 billion, reported CNBC with reference to circles.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.
Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their support in June.
A quick choice
It all happened a lot faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the ZDF board of directors had pushed the acting editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster is able to present his successor.
Yesterday evening, the committee wanted to vote on the appointment.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of ZDF's main studio in Berlin.
But ZDF did not confirm this - officially, not to anticipate the process.
However, the plan not to further damage ZDF director Markus Schächter, if this suggestion were also not successful with the board of directors, will also have played its part.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 committee members.
The result of the vote was not known when going to press.
Two weeks ago Schächter had been unsuccessful at the board of directors with his suggestion to extend the agreement with Nikolaus Brender by another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven were against him. Brender's voting out was a severe blow to Schächter, albeit one to be expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the administrative board had signaled already weeks before the vote that they would not confirm Brender in office.
Roland Koch, the prime minister of Hesse, had organised the opposition to the editor-in-chief.
With the argument that ZDF's news broadcasts had lost viewers under Brender, he rejected a further term in office of the highly regarded editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the exercising of political influence on the ZDF was castigated.
Most recently, 35 civil rights campaigners had even joined the debate and rated the actions of Koch to be in breach of the Constitution.
To no avail.
Personal details
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political and educational sciences and Romance studies.
He later worked for the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to the ZDF, initially to the heute-journal.
Subsequent activities: From 1988 to 1990 personal officer of the editor-in-chief; in 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and presenter of the Morgenmagazin; until 2001 head of ZDF foreign affairs; then head of the ZDF head studio.
The Greens announced after the voting out of Brender, who was voted journalist of the year by the sector paper Medium Magazin only on Wednesday, to press constitutional charges.
Koch's opponent on the board of directors, the Rhineland-Palatine prime minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the states should amend the ZDF treaty to the extend that staff suggestions of the director cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck too ruled out any removal of party politicians from the boards of directors of the ZDF.
Brender's expected successor, Peter Frey, had recommended himself to the board of directors with a clever move - by harshly criticising the committee immediately after it voted out Brender.
Thanks to this proof of editorial independence, both Schächter without losing face and the board of directors were able to vote for his appointment as editor-in-chief, without being suspected of promoting a partisan to this post.
In party calculations, Frey is reckoned to be a left-leaning liberal anyway.
University courses to be cleared out
Partial success for students: After a year of educational strikes, the culture ministers of the states finally came around on Thursday: At a meeting of the Culture Minister and University Principals Conference, both parties agreed to improve the conditions of studying for bachelor and masters courses.
The students should, in the future, be in a position to master their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the number of exams: Every module shall, as a rule, be completed with one single exam.
In addition, the students' workload shall be reviewed and "a realistic and acceptable extent" ensured.
Politicians and colleges also want to simplify the recognition of exams taken between the colleges inside and outside Germany.
The states undertake to organise more flexibly joint structural requirements for bachelor and masters courses.
State regulations deviating from this, shall not be imposed.
Less exams
Since the start of the student protests in June, culture ministers and university principals have been referring to the dictum of better studiability.
Now it is being filled with specific contents for the first time.
The so-called accreditation council has decided to, in part, dramatically reduce the number of exams: "Every module ends, as a rule, with an exam," states the 30-page paper, which is to newly govern the admission of courses in part.
With the "clear reduction of the examination load", explains accreditation council chairman Reinhold Grimm, "an undesirable development is to be stopped, which had a grave impact on studiability".
In addition, "studiability" is to be the core criterion for the organisation in the future.
Modules and contents "shall be strictly reviewed" as to whether "unnecessary constrictions on the students in their choice of
events" would be avoided.
The students are "entitled to be granted leeway allowing and promoting initiative".
The rules are to apply for the admission of new but also for the review of existing courses.
They need to be "reaccredited" every five years, which, however, means that it may take until 2015 until all courses have been reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany oversee this, which report to the Accreditation Council set up by the states.
The culture ministers had "expressly" urged the states in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the number of subjects is not too large and the exams regime not too strict.
In some federal states, universities and colleges have already agreed on corresponding measures with the state ministries.
Rhineland-Palatine has promised additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process;so far, it is the only state to do so.
With this money, the colleges are, in particular, to set up tutor programmes and course consultations as well as strengthen exams and foreign offices.
The state and colleges plan to earmark 10 million euros for this.
In early 2010 the government wants to bring an amendment to the Universities Act before parliament.
According to it, only one exam should be necessary to complete a course model.
The course design is to become more flexible, while the recognition of past academic records at other universities is to become easier along with access to masters courses.
By the end of the coming year, all courses of the state are to be examined for their studiability.
The government and opposition had again argued over the study requirements in the state on Thursday.
On top of praise, there was also criticism for the decisions.
The federal board of the Young Socialist University Groups demanded the design of education policy should no longer take place "behind the closed doors" of ministers and university principals.
After the educational strike, at the latest, students should now also "have their say" as those affected.
The future academics received support from the president of the Conference of University Principals (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experiences of the students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the culture ministers, with whom the HRK was debating a joint reform paper.
The Education and Science Union (GEW) deemed the Bonn decisions to be not radical enough: It is demanding a legal claim, which would allow every graduate with a bachelor degree admission on a further masters course.
On the other hand, the states must ensure that for the current generation of bachelor students there are sufficient places on master courses with best-possible studying conditions, says GEW executive board member Andreas Keller.
The states must employ significantly more lecturers.
The culture ministers did, however, not issue a statement regarding free admission to masters courses.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Going in and out of Germany is nice, virtually no checks..." is the first line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he describes in disturbing fragments a dissident's experience of arrival, who had gained freedom but simultaneously lost his language area.
Werner Söllner, born in Romania's Banat in 1951, initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as an editor in a children's publishing house, before he moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has won several literature awards, in 1993 he was awarded the legendary Frankfurt Poetry Readings at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hesse Literature Forum in the Mouson Tower in Frankfurt.
He caused a major extra-literary stir last Tuesday during a conference in Munich, debating "German literature in Romania in the reflection and distortion of its Securitate files".
Clearly unsettled and embarrassed, Söllner read out a statement, in which he admitted before Romano-German writer colleagues, i.e. Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his participation as an IM for the Romanian secret service, Securitate.
Jointly with some of those present, Söllner 1989 had received the German language award in 1989.
The recruitment attempts started gradually, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner concluded, "therefore someone, who did not put up enough resistance to the intimidation attempts of the Securitate."
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Virtually at the same time as the awarding of the Nobel prize for Herta Müller and her unmatched literary discussion of the mechanisms of dictatorships, the literary scene and, in particular, the community of German authors with Romanian roots is being shocked by a case which reveals the dark spots and perfidy of a political system based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is, inasmuch as can be said on the basis of the current knowledge, not only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
In his Securitate file, IM Walter played a part, said after Söllner's confession the literary scholar Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence IM Walter had for him.
He "boxed him out" in all points which were dangerous for him at the time, said Markel.
He has a moral need to make this statement.
Söllner's statement was in this form unexpected before this audience, although the confession of a former dissident and his collaboration with the Romanian secret service is not entirely surprising.
Germany was a cosy habitat for the Security spies, as Herta Müller had already written in July in the Zeit newspaper after reading her own file, 914 pages.
Those affected, one can assume, will have guessed and in some cases even known whose real name was behind the code names of Sorin, Voicu and, of course, Walter.
Contrary to the now very secure process of viewing Stasi files in Germany, the approach to the legacy of Securitate control is still very diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been undermined and hindered in recent years.
A National Council to Process Securitate Files (SNSAS), which is comparable to the Birthler Authority, was only set up in 1999, but the release of the files has been very slow.
A law regulating the administration of the files has only existed since 2005.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members is still very big in Romania was proven after the announcement of the Nobel prize for Herta Müller by an interview, in which a former Securitate head from Timisoara spoke in derogatory terms of the prize winner.
They is psychotic, she was, after all, questioned more than once.
The infamy of power believed it could openly speak in the guise of freedom of speech.
The Söllner case does, as so often in connection with silent guilt, raise questions.
Why only now? Who fell victim? The level-headed reaction of the audience to Söllner's statement gives rise to the hope that a continuation of this chapter will be determined by the need for information than finger-pointing and shame.
Regarding the genesis of Herta Müller's oeuvre, who yesterday received the Nobel prize, it is more than a footnote.
The Champions League - a side dish
It seemed as if a well-dressed field sales representative was just coming from a very nice Christmas party, where a sports items manufacturer had handed out goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross in the company of an orange plastic bag from the supplier got in a called out Mercedes C class at a quarter past midnight. ¨
The man with the striking bald head was still needing a chauffeur, as the town was still unknown to him.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - after all, no alcohol was involved and the 55-year-old was not drunk.
A nice evening, but tomorrow the work would continue.
Or only just get going.
In the words of the Swiss national, who had only just been employed three days before: "We may have reached the last sixteen," i.e. in the Champions League thanks to a 3:1 win over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we mustn't be blinded by the success: We are in for a brutal fight against relegation."
The "far more important task" is scheduled for Sunday.
The Champions League performance will have to be repeated in the day-to-day job of the league.
And the again revealed weaknesses after the three quick goals by Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.) will have to be stopped.
Draw
The last sixteen of the Champions League (first leg 16/17 + 23/24 February/second leg 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy over the excellent start of the Babbel successor therefore remained mute.
Not only with the apparent saviour, who had given the unsettled Stuttgart professionals self-confidence, commitment and joy in playing in a short period of time.
"I addressed the players and told them that they must consider their strengths, and urged them to be more courageous," explained shrink Gross his so simple-sounding recipe for success, which no longer had any effect under therapist Babbel.
He set a certain magic alight, admitted Babbel fan Lehmann, "When now impulses are given in football, things happen which are considered to be impossible".
And Sami Khedira, who became the man of the match thanks to his dynamic approach having been injured for weeks, tried to describe the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "breath of fresh air" and the work approach of the new boss: "He is a man who takes drastic measures and demands discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation."
Under Babel this was clearly lacking.
VfB Stuttgart is still not out of the woods, warns sports director Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs, more than anything, consistency.
Like Gross, players and managers were eager not to overestimate the win over the depleted and hopelessly overburdened defence of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before the horribly awakening three days later in Leverkusen in the 0:4, warned Khedira.
And sports director Horst Heldt pointed out that one aim of the season had been achieved, but that the other one was still a long way off.
We are not out of the woods yet.
The fact that Heldt was not in any mood to celebrate on his 40th birthday and even on the first home win for three months, had to do with the events of the weekend, which were revived in the form of a TV interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, which was screened immediately before the match.
There are decisions which other people take and not Jens, was Heldt's response to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had accused the directors of a lack of leadership, who had decided to replace the manager under pressure from pubescent fans.
The fact that his day off after matches had been cancelled, was also rated by Lehmann as a sign of a lack of authority and resentment.
Lehmann's statements were "guided by pure egoism", replied Heldt and announced consequences for the keeper.
It is unlikely they will become friends for life.
But, after all, they agreed with everybody else that without the work done by the replaced team of coaches, the strong performance, both in terms of play and spirit, would not have been possible.
Babel and seine assistants had "a great share in the success", said Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
Worldcup heavyweight box match
Heated duel in Berne: Challenger Kevin Johnson kept provoking world champion Vitali Klitchko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the WBC.
The verdict of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitchko remains heavyweight boxing world champion.
On Saturday night in Berne the 38-year-old champion (the WBC association version,) beat the American Kevin Johnson unanimously by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitchko this was his third successful defence of his title since his comeback in October 2008.
Before, the Ukrainian had already twice been world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knock-out, which everybody had expected, did not materialise.
Klitchko extended his record to 39 wins in 41 professional matches, twice he had to give in due to injury.
Challenger Johnson saw his first defeat in 24 fights.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Berne Arena, the 2.02-metre tall Klitchko aimed to dictate the match predominantly with his left hitting hand.
But the eleven centimetres shorter Johnson, how had announced the end of the Klitchko era before the fight, kept evading the hits from the world champion, meaning that Klitchko was not able to apply a decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
Overall, the passive Johnson did not do enough for a challenger and simply tried to survive the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitchko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely hit the world champion.
Nevertheless, he is only the second boxed since Timo Hoffmann in 2000 who fight the full twelve rounds against Klitchko.
The challenger had caused quite a stir in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitchko as "an ugly zombie", who "cannot do anything at all".
During weighing, the champion then allowed himself to be provoked to knock Johnson's sunglasses of his nose "to be able to see into his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitchko's return
Klitchko came out on top in his fourth fight since his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After a sabbatical nearly four years, he beat the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and regained "his" WBC belt, which he had been forced to hand over before without a fight.
This year he then beat in the defence of his title the Cuban Juan Carlos Gomez from and Chris Arreola from the US in September.
I only took one blow in this fight, and am physically in very good shape, Klitchko said after the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the unification of all important titles in his family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
But the WBA belt is worn by Britan David Haye after he dethroned the 2.13-metre tall Nikolay Valuev in November.
Haye had previously cancelled in the summer a fight planned to take place in September against Vitali Klitchko.
Apparently, his promotion company is now already planning a fight against Klitchko at London's Wembley stadium.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green party head Jürgen Trittin calls defence minister Guttenberg a liar for providing false information on the Kunduz affair.
SPD and Left Party demanding a clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - After the recent revelations regarding the air raid of Kunduz, the opposition has accused defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberate deception.
The minister apparently made "knowingly false statements" regarding the fatal bombing of two tank trailers in September, said Green party head Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news programme Tagesschau.
This is generally referred to as lying.
The order to kill was given in defiance of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) for Afghanistan.
That is the substance of the report, which NATO had, which Mr. Guttenberg has read, said Trittin.
On Friday it was revealed that the attack was not only about destroying the abducted tankers, but also to specifically kill two Taleban leaders.
The US air strike ordered by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, up to 142 people were killed of injured, according to the NATO inquiry report.
The Greens, SPD and Left Party Linke called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to address parliament immediately and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy, and whether the Chancellor's Office, German army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his Greens colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism resolutely.
The Chancellor's Office did not take any influence on specific missions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts over the presentation by the ministry of the background of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert emerged.
According to information available to SPIEGEL, the two provided Guttenberg with correct and complete information on the background of the tanker trailer attack.
Officially, it was said that they had lied about the existence of the NATO reports and kept sensitive details from the minister.
From the entourage of the top official, however, it was said that the defence ministry had even been directed to several reports, including a two-page documents of the commanding colonel Klein and a report from the military police.
In the meantime, Wichert is supposed to have asked for clarification in a letter, reports the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
He has not received a response, it is claimed.
The ministry did not comment on the accusations on Saturday and referred to the fact that this would be clarified by the inquiry committee of parliament, which would be set up next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images and hear voices when they are awake which others do not hear or see.
Not only in the mentally sick and during intoxication with drugs do the borders between imagination and reality become blurred.
As long as this happens in sleep, things are fine.
When we are in dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can surrender to the wildest imaginations and fantasies without restraint.
But anybody experiencing dream-like conditions or seeing and hearing things other people do not when they are awake, is regarded in contemporary Western society as a madman or drug addict, or strange at the very least.
But such images and voices are formed not only in the mentally sick or during drug intoxication.
This is down to our imagination: The same neural processes which allow us to design houses, draw paintings or write novels can make the borders between dream, madness and reality become blurred.
Conscious conditions which are warped like dreams can occur in the most different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Even if their triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shaman detachment from reality conditions, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucination or delusions occur when the balance of the neural transmitters of the brain - predominantly dopamine noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - derails and the interaction of different brain segments is dysfunctional.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts often occur during schizophrenic psychoses.
Gravity no longer has any power over him
The connection between madness and dream has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations to be a form of dream while awake, Wilhelm Griesinger, a founder of modern psychiatry, detected in 1861 a "huge similarity of madness and dreamlike conditions", for Sigmund Freud dreams were even "a psychosis, with all puzzles, delusions and misperceptions of such".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and excessively gaudy.
Gravity no longer has any power over him, he floats at the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him are winged devilish figures with red, distorted faces, snarling.
They hunt him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices emerge from the walls and radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that abuse and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo system, ties them to a knot and attaches it to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a speaker and puts the noose around his neck.
He jumps.
The noose becomes loose.
Let that be a lesson to you, the voices scream in an eardrum-tearing choir, "go to the clinic and get treated!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has had six acute psychoses, the last one is two years back, the first nearly 20 years ago.
It was caused by LSD.
His diagnosis is a schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, he is also a manic-depressive, he takes drugs against depression, the mania and schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis I experienced the worst fear and deepest desperation, he says.
The illusions are a brutal reality
About 1 per cent of the population suffers at least once in their lifetime from schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics, it is treated with a frequency only second to depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, people affected can no longer distinguish between internal and external world, they reach an overexcited condition which can result in hallucinations, megalomania, paranoia or persecution mania.
Particularly common is the hearing of voices - voices which command, comment or involve in dialogue.
Visual hallucinations are also not rare.
The affected person can no longer distinguish important things from unimportant things, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the conscious is flooded by impressions.
Like dreams, a psychosis also opens the floodgates on a flood of ideas and phantasies, which stem from the deeper levels of the conscious.
The perception of reality in a psychosis is subject-centred, says professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Clinic for General Psychiatry at the University Clinic of Heidelberg.
Schizophrenic patients are at the heart of the events, the meaning of everything is directed to him.
At the same time, he finds himself in a passive role, he is, like in a dream, overwhelmed by the events can cannot affect them actively.
Schizophrenic patients therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality comparison is often not available to them, the illusions are a brutal reality, waking up is not possible.
To experience a hallucination once in your life
Contrary to dreams, says Fuchs, "the sensual and spatial structure of reality, as perceived during a psychosis, remains intact as a rule".
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based in reality, the distortion of the events takes place within a framework of reality.
Precisely why our brain plays such tricks on us, is still puzzling to scientists.
Extraordinary conditions can cause any person to lose his sense of reality for a short period of time, says Fuchs.
But not everybody will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic tendency to schizophrenia, but studies of twins have shown that genes are not the sole factor.
Scientists assume that patients have minimal brain damage.
We think that the neuronal maturing of the brain is disturbed in an early stage of development, through a virus infection in the mother during pregnancy, for instance, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery how disturbances to the neuronal system comes about which also do not become manifest for many years initially.
Environmental impacts also play a part - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger psychoses if the disposition is given.
Hallucinogen drugs can trigger psychoses, as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brain runs hot
The mad thing is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive medication to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get the same, says Lübeck-based psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether these illusions are perceived to be pleasant or unpleasant is often only a matter of perspective.
Kasten has been collecting reports for ten years on hallucinations and delusions; last year he assessed his results in a book titled The unreal World in our Head.
Hallucinations are a typical by-product of psychoses, but also of a remarkably large amount of other diseases.
These include, on top of mental illnesses such as borderline or depression, also often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injuries.
Surprisingly, even the brain of healthy people hallucinates under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, says Kasten, consist of memory fragments, which are often held back.
They occur when areas of the brain, where sensory perceptions are processed, are overactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brain runs hot and also when there is a lack of stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as much as brain damage or a psychosis.
But sensory deprivation, stress, lovesickness or other mental exceptional conditions too.
In more recent studies, up to one third of respondents claimed to have experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she is living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and goes to the local secondary school.
Indeed, a perfectly normal girl.
It it were not for the images and voices.
During breaks, it can happen that a lanky boy with long dark hair approaches her.
When she answers him, her schoolmates look at her in surprise - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They think the girls is a nutty daydreamer, but Sarah K. is not dreaming, she knows that much.
She is awake, she sees and hears this boy, just like she sees and hears the girl at the desk next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for some moments.
A pleasant feeling it is, she likes the boy.
Am I mad? she sometimes asks.
But she knows that this boy and the other illusions are not real and disappear again.
At night the appearances are usually frightening
The illusions are often a strain.
When she is sitting in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow because the teacher is to her eyes and ears just introducing a new schoolmate, while she is explaining mathematical equations on the blackboard for everyone else.
At night the appearances are usually frightening.
When she is waiting for sleep in her dark room, which comes far too rarely and late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grimaces or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs is standing in front of her open or closed eyes.
Let me be, she screams at the figures.
She does not tell her parents or friends anything about this, they would think she was mad.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old now.
She passed her A levels last year and is now living with her boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted psychologist Kasten via the internet, she knows exactly that she is not mad.
Madness is also work of art born out of desperation
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from sensory deprivation, he will very probably suffer from hallucinations after some time, says Kasten.
I assume that the brain is not busy enough and creates its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children when she was small; she often played alone.
Her hallucinations started when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she called dad since she could think was not her natural father.
As during visual and acoustic hallucinations those areas of the brain become active which also process real impressions and sounds, it is often difficult for patients like Sarah K. to distinguish between illusions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is reproduced there.
Hallucinations are also images, which the brain creates, this is why they seem so real."
Illusions at night are also classified by Kasten as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of the healthy are not fundamentally different from those during an acute psychosis.
Contrary to schizophrene patients, mentally healthy people are able to identify illusions as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate hallucinations as a special ability.
Border between dream and hallucination
In our far too conscious-centred world, imaginary experiencing is often unfortunately pathologised, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and senior physician of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, painful illness, but it also brings positive aspects, creativity - madness is also a work of art born out of desperation.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroid experience, a particular form of conscious conditions which are warped like dreams.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams, which the person experiencing them believes are real and which he later cannot distinguish from being awake.
The oneiroid condition occurs in trauma- or sickness-related extreme situations, for instance in polyradiculitis patients, who experience a motor paralysis in full consciousness.
If a person is threatened by self- or world loss, for instance due to persistent, complete loss of mobility, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with an own, imaginary world, which is uncoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of border between dream and hallucination
As the mastering of a situation is not possible in reality, a change of world takes place, but the real situation is not updated in the imagination.
An intense form of creating and applying meaning in an unbearable situation, which allows us people our own ability to design and not go under in the emptiness of a loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
The Zurich-based art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book A Change of Heart as the sole's attempt to safe itself.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness takes off on journeys for days after heart valve surgery with subsequent heart transplantation while his body is damned to immobility in the intensive care unit.
Claussen delves into a world of his creation, visits foreign places and times: He experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watching over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages amongst noblemen who make intoxicants from blood.
He is abducted by a Greek man on his motorbike to his homeland, surfs with his hospital bed in the spring snow of the Alps and meets a Korean member of the mafia.
He is fully taken up with the imaginary events; everything is real, even later in his memory.
These inner trips, Claussen believes, are fundamentally different from every dream.
Dream is a different condition, he describes his experience.
Contrary to that, the memories from mental trips are overtly clear to me even after years and in minute detail.
Even clearer and more intense that real events.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our day-to-day experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug intoxication show how fragile our images of the external reality are, even when awake.
Every change to the conscious, summarises psychologist Kasten, "can result in a warping of what we call reality".
An experience which can indeed be enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
Children set to take over the publishing house at the age of 27
Kallen, the new head of the publishing house, is an interim solution: In the long term, Hubert Burda wants his company to be taken over by his two children, he has told the SPIEGEL magazine.
The holding is to remain to 100% in the family.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees the long-term future of his company in his children's hands.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and are strongly intent on joining the company, the 69-year-old has told the SPIEGEL magazine.
The details have already been organised as a precaution.
The question whether they will be active in the company will only arise later.
Also the question whether they are able to do so.
One cannot put one's children in charge of 7,500 employees if they are not capable of this.
That will kill the children, and the company with them.
On Thursday, Burda announced that he would be resigning from his post as chairman as of January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the board at Burda since 1999.
He was initially responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury department, he assumed responsibility for the company assets, and after Jürgen Todenhöfer's departure, also for direct marketing, foreign operations, print and finances.
For the first time, a person who is not a family member is thus at the helm of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17; his son Felix, who would be 42 today, died a couple of years ago.
The appointment of Kallen is designed to "bridge 10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding is to remain to 100 per cent in family ownership, said Burda.
In light of the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda stated that family-owned companies are not safe from going under either: "That always affected families who were infected with a capital addiction, who speculated wrongly and through they could advance to become a really big player.
That never was my strategy.
He never had "dreams of world power", says Burda.
I do not see myself as a political preceptor of the country, as Springer was, and I do not want to participate in the world league with Time magazine, these companies have become too big.
Comprehensive Beauty
Everything you could want in terms of beauty and comfort -at your fingertips.
This is what El Corte Inglés, which has just opened a multidisciplinary space of more than 1,000m2 dedicated to bodycare and pampering in the Callao (Madrid) shopping center, seems to be aiming for.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious firms like Hedonai, offering laser hair removal ; Spaxión, with relaxation and rooms for beauty treatment;hairdressers Luis & Tachi; Marina d'Or, which has a gym; and L'Occitane and their natural cosemtics, among others.
There is also a food section, which features a teashop with more than 130 different kinds of tea.
Enjoying a relaxing masage with your partner while you look out over the unbeatable views of the capital, or renting out the relax area for 2 hours to throw your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relaxing with a jacuzzi session, massages, and drinking a glass of champagne are just some of the possibilities Spaxión offers.
A total of 250 m2 are distributed amongst 12 rooms to carry out the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Such as, for example, cavitation to combat cellulite, or vibration platforms.
The gym has these machines, in addition to virtual trainers which guide the steps of the clients, offering them a totally personalized treatment.
Everything starts by entering your personal key on the touch screen situated in front of the machine.
Then, various videos show us how to properly perform our workout plan.
Its director guarantees that 15 minutes (including warm up and stretching) are enough to exercise all of the muscles in the body.
And, if after our workout we want to drop by the hairdresser's,Luis & Tachi provides a salon where they offer personal hair services to restore its brilliance and nutrition.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the premise of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 in the morning to 10:00 at night.
Varied necklines
Christmas is approaching, and it never hurts to revisit the looks of the stars to suit our holiday wardrobe.
The neckline, very important for enhancing the silhoutte, is one of the facts we should take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neck line.This is not recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona with the electric car
The electric company Endesa, together with Barcelona City Council, has created 'Office LIVE.'
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
Office LIVE' (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city, and will define the conditions for mobility, management, coordination, present subsidies, etc.
Moreover, MOVELE will develop the project, promote the electric car, review public opinion and work from the sectors involved.
In short, it hopes to promote what will be the transportation of the future.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that is going to be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
They are the three cities chosen by the Government to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle within the MOVELE plan.
The electric company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
With that, it hopes to promote the activities of the Research and Technological Development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include activities linked to energy and, in particular, energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative Endesa is involved in regarding the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at the European level and has a series of active complementary projects, such as G4V, ELVIRE and CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of peace' for the automotive sector.
The Prime Minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, catches a glimpse of 'a horizon of peace' for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he pointed out, is the principal export sector in the country.
In the Prime Minister's presentation of the Economic Report for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures the government had launched throughout the fiscal year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a panorama of neglect and the closure of some of our major production plants," the Prime Minister explained.
"Through this plan and the arrangement of the brands to continue in this highly competitive sector in Spain, we can have a horizon of peace for the future of this industry, which is our principal export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that theCompetitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Plan of the Automobile Industry (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The head of the Executive Branch explained that this investment was committed as much to the development of new models as it was to upgrading already existing products and processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government's measures to support the demand, alluding to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the Autonomous Communities and automotive brand.
According to the Prime Minister, this plan has reduced emissions by 6% in new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and has brought about a "sharp increase" in enrollment, which rose by "40 percent" in November..
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles.
The first year of the International Classic Car Showroom will be celebrated in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and amateurs of the motor world.
This initiative will take place from the 5th to the 7th of February, 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
This is a 20,000 square meter exhibition area, and more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be there.
Not only will you find classic motorcycles and cars at ClassicAuto Madrid, there will also be all kinds of products related to the motor world.
So you will find the exhibitors at the pavilion displaying accessories, parts, components, textile accessories, complements, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of classic motors will delight collectors and the curious.
Participating companies will include Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, automobile sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, automobile sales and restoration, and Cocher Clásicos, Mercedes Benz specialists.
Outdoor tests of skill.
The business of this Showroom will also feature parallel activities: rallies, sports exhibitions, tests of skill, presentations and competitions.
Tests of skill in classic cars and motorcycles will also take place on an authorized track outside the exhibition site.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Sustainable sportsmanship
Mazda wants to show that sportsmanship is not incompatible with the environment.
Therefore, Mazda3 has just added an engine stopping and starting system - dubbed as the i-Stop -, a mechanism which is, for the moment at least, only available with the 150-horse power 2.0 petrol engine.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for its overall high ratings.
The finishes, features, comfort, performance, mechanics, the i-Stop system…
All of these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driver's seat, we see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and support.
The feel of the steering wheel is also exquisite.
Moving on to thecombination of the dashboard and console, we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design with a great deal of buttons, knobs and striking red and blue colors.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
So, we can say that the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of the German products, more specifically, the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the interior, this Japanese compact is easily roomy enough for four adults to travel in great comfort.
All of this comes with a spacious trunk and standard dimensions.
The engine's automatic stopping and starting system, at least for now, is only available with the two-liter, 150-horse-power, manual, six-gear, petrol engine.
This engine is a real delight.What makes it outstanding are its subtlety, reduced noise levels, features and fuel consumption.
And even though the diesel versions of the Madzda3 will be in higher demand, those who don't do too much mileage a year should not dismiss this i-Stop petrol engine system, both for its elevated driving comfort and its fuel consumption.
As regards the level of the equipment, the version chosen for the test is called the Sportive, meaningit incorporates a high number of standard elements.
The standard equipment is excellent, especially the lane changing assistant (RVM) which eliminates the blind spot, the traction and stability controls, the speed control, the interior photosensitive mirror, the large-screen onboard computer, the parking sensors, independent climate control, rain and lights sensor, Bluetooth and Bluetooth audio, and 17" alloy wheels.
Additionally, with less equipment, this version comes with the Premium Pack, which, for 1,500 euros, also features: bi-xenon adaptive headlights and a BOSE sound system with CD changer, among other things.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in its category.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the quality of the materials used, its performance, and the high standard of its equipment.
Additionally, those who do less yearly mileage can opt for this version of the i-Stop, associated only with the 150-horse-power 2.0 engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which ranges from 21,770 euros for the Luxury pack to 23,270 euros for the Sportive version, tested here.
In exchange for the high price, the Mazda3 will offer a large daily dose of satisfaction.
Deluxe 'Premiere'
L. A. covers the red carpet of sensuality by the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars were more dazzling than ever, wrapped in designer dresses, as elegant as they were sexy, at the premiere of 'Nine'.(Photos: Gtresonline)
Our own 'Pe', as sophisticated as ever, decided on a dark 'lady.'
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that's only used for checking email, without no feature for viewing certain kinds of attachments or surfing the web.
It enjoyed its 5 minutes of fame in the U.S. when Times Magazine named it one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is more difficult, to be honest, but the idea can be interesting, especially for children.
Unlike smartphones, the Peek is very cheap and has a very low monthly fee, less than half, for example, of the iPhone's data plan.
Given its success, the company has released two new devices: one exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free data service for life in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented at the La Web event yesterday, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is just as limited as its U.S. counterpart, but comes with a surprise.
The monthly service price, around 12 euros a month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it's like to have to give up data when they cross the border or desperately search for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection)to check their mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and long awaited.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The repeated twisting of the European Commission's arm to get affordable roaming rates across Europe has had almost no noticeable effect.
There's a fear of using data outside one's home country, and rightly so.
For a gadget like the FonPeek (it no longer seems strange that it is called Fon since it lacks WiFi) to get this kind of fee, it means that the operators are starting the think differently and study different means of recouping the cost of their data networks.
The Kindle is another good example, including a book downloading feature and other internet queries.
No contracts, no bother.
It's a connected device and is paid for when it's purchased, not month by month.
And that is what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a call option with life-time access, which the Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I check my mail on my phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it's an unfair model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's color fetish
Yellow is, without a doubt, the U.S. First Lady's favorite color.
She already attended Barak Obama's inauguration as U.S. president in a yellow dress and coat; she chose the same to accompany him to what was undoubtedly the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar dress on both occasions:apart from being a similar yellow-green color with bright highlights-, both times the outfit consisted of three pieces, a dress, jacket and coat of the same material, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so that, at first glance, it seemed the first lady of the U.S. has been following the Princess of Asturias' lead and has opted to repeat her wardrobe.
But the material the two suits are made of make them very different.
If the inauguration was about thick lace, in Oslo it was patterned velvet.
The accessories have also varied: green medium-heeled shoes the other time, and now a similar design, but in gold.
And equally different is the hair style: on this occasion, hair tied back; previously she wore her hair down.
75% of working mothers have had work problems during maternity.
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This has been revealed by a study entitled 'Fertility and work history of women in Spain', developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women from 15 to 75 years old leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working mothers have seen their opportunities in the workplace limited due to maternity.
The study notes that there are many differences in when couples start cohabiting, in the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they do.
Those that don't have an activity outside of the home, work part time, or don't have a stable job start living with their partner sooner, expect their first child, and have more children.
By contrast, women with a stable job, especially in the public sector, put off cohabitation and motherhood and have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years old with steady work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting to live together,a figure which increases to 4.1; women with steady jobs need more time to achieve their lifelong goals, which has led them to postpone getting married and having children.
Additionally, the type of job held has a great influence over maternity, but less over the mating schedule," explains CSIC researcher, Margarita Delgado.
Level of education is another factor whichdifferentiates the age of women marrying and having their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the older the age at which they get married and have their first child.
There was also a difference among women from the same generation.
For example, in a group of 35- to 49-year-olds, those who had elementary and those who and higher education had become mothers for the first time, on average, at 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
Their level of education provides yet another division among women.
While those who have an elementary education marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have secondary or higher levels of education reverse the sequence and give priority to securing a stable job as a precondition to marriage and having a child," Delgado specifies.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its enviable list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will become the image of the brand's different products, singing the universal slogan 'Because I'm worth it.'
The star of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the finest actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities signed to L'Oreal Paris, like Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spaniard Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last ones to enter such an elite club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire').
For the men's line, the cosmetic brand also includes deluxe ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's co-star on 'Lost').
The British Fashion Awards

Top representatives - designers and models, past and present -gathered at the annual awards presentation, which took place in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
Nobody missed the date.
The former model Jerry Hall'sdaughter, Georgia May Jagger, was chosen as Model of the Year.
Poker by Manuel Vicent
In 'Four Aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) Manuel Vicent gives us thirty profiles of writers who have passed through their literary life (and, in some cases, the other one too).
He does not do it in predictable or terrible ways (biographical sketch, life and work),rather by looking for something that sparked the creation of the character.
The trip has its excitements, and Vincent us spares no scares or illuminations.
In addition to being an exquisite pleasure, the book is a touching invitation to be read and reread.
Here are some snippets.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean wasn't a sea, rather a spiritual instinct, almost physical, the same one I felt without giving it a name: the pleasure against the ill-fated, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilistic, allegorical Christian, he wrote what was in his blood, not in his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in which flesh combined the excitement of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege which consisted of reaching heaven through the road of perdition."
On James Joyce: "'Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach.This is one of the eight-thousand-meter peaks of world literature which must be scaled by the north face, which the best mountain climbers hurl themselves off time and time again."
On William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy."
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner in the county, and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
"They were both dreams of grandeur."
On Louis-Ferdinand Celine: "This writer took the deranged scream cried from a bridge by that character from Munich in order to carry his eco, under his literary form, into the depths of the night of the 20th century, and made it a journey, hiding from himself and calling on the past with a violent discourse to the worms."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day, she kneeled and prayed: ' Dear God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman'."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were engraved these verses from Spencer: 'Sleep after toil,/port after stormy seas,/ease after war,/ death after life does greatly please.'"
On Virginia Wolf: "She also carried her depressions in her luggage.
The husband accepted it as normal when she told him that Edward VII spied on her from the azaleas and that the birds sang in Greek.
There has never been a man so patient and in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent came before her madness."
On Pio Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to pass Baroja through the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do but abduct the glory of that man so that it would serve his own pedestal?
Cowardly Aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the town of Fuenlabrada when a group of kids between 15 and 18 years old passed alongside her and our dog, a mixed-breed, rescued from the pound and weighing no more than six kilos, and, without saying a word, kicked the dog twice, leaving the dog badly injured.
Our indignation knew no bounds because we don't see the fun in gratuitous aggression towards a small and defenseless animal, which by the way, was on a leash.
It must be added that it distressed the woman who was calmly taking a walk and who, when she reprimanded those individuals, came to fear for her safety, because a lunatic who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same to a woman, a child, an elderly person, and, certainly, to anyone weaker than himself.
The incident took place on aTuesday at five o'clock in the afternoon in what is usually a quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we filed a complaint at a nearby police station which we doubt means much, notto stir up trouble, just to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what is happening when young people consider it fun to gratuitously mistreat a defenseless animal which gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We don't know if there is any politeness and respect for animals and people left.
Michelin and Fesvial united on the use of helmets
The tire manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially among younger motorists, both organizations reported today.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, because it is the only means of protection capable of preventing head injuries and even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of their commitment to road safety which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day," and added that it also contributes towards this goal by means of other educational and informative measures.
This new campaign promoting helmet use in motorcycles, under the motto 'To be or not to be,' will initially distribute posters to more than 500 motorcycle shops to spread the message as widely as possible.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, as being a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main goals is to develop ever safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles on the increase
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent a rise of 12.6% from 2008, and, more importantly, indicates the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the manufacturers association(ANFAC) and the vendors association (GANVAM).
However, it's not time to start celebrating since the reference the comparison was made to -November 2008- was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease from the previous year.
The outcome is that, regardless of last month's upturn, the total number of registrations during those 11 months is 40% below last year's.
Since January, 95,853 units of all the vehicle classes which make up the hotchpotch of light commercial vehicles were sold: derived vans, pick ups, vans, light vans and light-chassis trucks.
At the same time, the storm clouds affecting demand have not completely cleared, so even though they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, almost all of which pay through external funding.
As a result of the restrictions caused by closed tap bank loans, it is necessary to add other factors like increasing unemployment and the persistent economic decline.
In light of this, unlike cars, the aid of the 2000Epurchase has done little.
Aside from individuals, provisions are made for the self-employed and SMEs that are going to purchase a light commercial vehicle of up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of transactions has been insignificant.
Just yesterday, the need for the Administration to devote special attention to these vehicles, and also to commercial verhicles (trucks and buses), was brought to mind by GANVAM.
The sellers' association predicts that 2010 will be similar to the year coming to a close, which estimates a 19% drop in sales (passenger cars and 4x4s).
Support for emergency braking is already obligatory
Support systems to emergency brakes will have to be a mandatory feature in European cars, just as it happened with anti-lock breaks (ABS) and will happen with stability control (ESP)
In fact, they are already in all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while the rest have a grace period until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase pedestrian safety; however, how they work can also help prevent many rear-end collisions.
What the emergency brake assistant does is increase the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, which the system detects through the driver's pressure on the pedal.
But this doesn't always maintain that pressure through to the end.
According to a study conducted by the car components manufacturer, Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident had not stepped on the brake before a collision and half of them didn't apply the full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, however, calls for the full braking system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this feature, 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided a year.
The reduction will be even bigger -it estimates that one in four accidents injuring people would be avoided - when the so-called smart emergency braking systems become popular.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which (via radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to lightly applying the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps it by increasing the pressure on the pedal if it is necessary.
If he does not react, and even though the collision is unavoidable, the device exerts the maximum force to the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays Opel plan until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April -probably the 8th- as reported by Javier Ortega, the U.S. manufacturer is cautioning that more time is needed to conclude the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants each of the points of the new plan to have the prior approval of the affected party.
And this may make the final document, which will be submitted first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is making sure that a decision regarding the sale of Saab should be made in the next few days.
