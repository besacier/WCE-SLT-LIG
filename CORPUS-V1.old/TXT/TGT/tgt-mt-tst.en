Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, said Mr Camus.
I have heard about a possible legal action to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus has estimated that Johnny Hallyday party was "far too fast for Los Angeles, with permission from the surgeon Parisian".
I had this doctor in person in line, which has assured me that there was no problem for this trip and I was amazed, given that I myself had two hernies discales, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, it had indicated that the singer was apparently "party without combat with nothing," after his operation in Paris.
Dr Stéphane delajoux is very experienced in the midst of art.
He had made the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death in a clinic to Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was at the time.
In 2007, he had also made the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reduce a hématome following a brain haemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor to the reputation sulfureuse, repeatedly condemned by the justice in medical liability, and for tax fraud and deception.
I Metzner tree, the lawyer of the order of doctors, has accused of being "a man without scruples" continued "regularly" before the Council of the order, and who is "not appropriate".
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David koubbi.
It has indicated that the intervention was "quite well" and that the tests post-opératoires were "normal".
The operation "was not hémorragique and is therefore not have a combat," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health worries are mounting for this summer, appears in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the Tour on 8 January (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr Camus.
The association UDF increase the tone and after the new centre to stop using its acronym
The association UDF, controlled by the modem to François Bayrou, responded Friday to the attempted takeover of the president of the new centre, Hervé Morin, the symbol of the ex-parti giscardien, in the setting is not to use it on any carrier, under pain of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, ruling that François Bayrou was not worthy to defend his legacy after reaching out to the left.
The defence minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support its approach, it has received the support of Hervé de Charette (ex-ump past the NC) which claims ownership of the UDF for being the first to the table in 2004 to the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the Bureau of the Association UDF, controlled by the Friends of François Bayrou who do not want to lose, is out of his silence to launch a formal notice to the minister and member, the request not to use the letters and transfer the ownership of the brand, for fear of prosecution.
You have multiplied in recent days the statements indicating that you were going to propose to your political movement of + resume + the acronym UDF, writing the association in a letter signed by 19 of 24 members of the bureau, whose François Bayrou and de Sarnez the modem, as well as Senator John Arthuis centrist alliance.
You have also seen fit to follow on your material militant and on the page in your site, the name of this movement, the new centre + + +, the slogan the UDF today +, also see the signatories of the mail.
As you know, you have no right to this symbol, explains the office of the UDF that is the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF to support and (his) website."
It also calls for Hervé de Charette "to pass on the property of (the) marks its legitimate copyright holders".
If you are not the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF warn the signatories.
In their letter they specify that the UDF 'is a political movement in full since 1978, "and argued that Mr Morin and his friends had" made the choice "to leave in 2007" to create a competitor, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP. "
The new centre did so, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (union for French democracy).
They also recall that the last Congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its accession to the modem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material interests and moral 'training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, is pursuing the bureau, "when he established the brand," he was "more unites the UDF for three years', but the UMP.
It is outrageous and sentenced to the abscence submission to the UDF to carry out to his account.
This brutality is turning into crime, dénoncent-ils before mock, on the strategy of the NC: "It seems that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for themselves than to try to get out of anonymity by taking fraudulently a name that was not right '.
Liliane Bettencourt affair: françois-marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness
The court in Nanterre decided Friday to assess the artist françois-marie Banier to determine if, as in accuses the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, it has benefited from a state of the weakness of the octogénaire to rob a part of his fortune.
The photographer of 62 years, known for its pictures of stars, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a criminal offence to a maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment and 375.000 euros fine.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the families of France, where mother and daughter have been taking the reins of the empire of the Oréal cosmetic.
But the 15th House criminal has also ordered that a medical expertise to Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87 years, should be conducted as a college by three doctors.
Heir and main shareholder of the Oréal has always refused to bow to such scrutiny, not in any case under the terms proposed by the public prosecutor of Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors named Friday to submit a report before 10 March 2010 by saying, especially if Liliane Bettencourt could find themselves in the state of weakness and what periods.
I think it will.
I am going to talk about it, said at the exit of the hearing Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman.
The lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...) expertise will show that he (Mr Banier) has manipulated this elderly lady that there must be protected, he said.
For two years ago, the daughter of Liliane Bettencourt engaged in criminal proceedings against françois-marie Banier, photographer and touche-à-tout artist, which it accuses of having benefited for years to the weakness of his mother for a billion of donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or pictures of Masters.
His hand, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, that it considers a friend.
While the court should examine the admissibility of the action by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers pleading, the lawyers have sometimes turned to the great déballage family on Friday.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt indicated three letters sent by its user (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his solicitor, in which it said was wary of her husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: 'Please explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years ago.
Françoise, I have never been able to speak to him since his marriage. "
The prosecutor of Nanterre has estimated that the testimony was not acceptable to act as a judge tutelles declined in recent days to grant her request to open a legal protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has the ability to act, it is not under the protection and has no guardian.
Nobody else has to act in its place, "said the representative of the public prosecutor, marie-chrsitine daubigney.
The court has decided that he consulted once the trial will take place on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers.
Revolution managerial or end of the intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the big French companies, our struggle for the development of the economic intelligence has been in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies to its employees, recalls the position of companies from consumers before the revolution marketing: it is to join the staff to "values" determined to as high as it was used to impose the consumer products invented by the technicians from the factory.
By the customer at the heart of the company, the revolution marketing has called the strategies of the conquest of markets in the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products unrelated factors of preferences of customers returning regularly.
A lack of employees can lead to a deadly demoralised.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of something much more general particularly managers.
This demobilisation threatens the development of all the company ’ s intellectual, including R & D, and even more, the intelligence.
Indeed, 'i movement "requires all the stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it needs by employees a commitment that revenue management authoritarian experienced completely.
This is why we call for a revolution managerial skills to set the staff at the centre of the company as the customer.
The value relative to the views of internal investigations.
The investigation of domestic opinion – as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its salariés- will encourage this revolution in the managerial?
Unfortunately, I suspect not.
Firstly because I saw that, in a new situation, any structure is finally, after beating, primarily … what it has always done.!
- then, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of the pouvoir- grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
Finally, because most of the leaders have a simple view of human behaviour.
From the great schools engineers, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They are, for comfort, intellectual, the old theory behavioriste, cranked up recently by the "Neuroscience" American and widely distributed, unbeknownst to them by institutes of studies and the media.
As well, suggesting that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) of the commitment of executives, a recent survey by Ipsos survey in the figaro.fr it reinforces the leaders in a position of governance, mechanistic unsuited to the world today.
Identify the causes of action.
Instead, the revolution managerial skills necessary to the functioning of the modern, requires companies to adopt a final vision of human behaviour.
It is to include, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, the commitment for the company is possible if it is clear as a means of achieving some of their dreams, their ambitions of their projects.
Currently, only the studies from the analysis motifonctionnelle adopt this view of the motives of employees.
These studies have shown that they think their company based on a predetermined doxa which allows them through their image from the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their projects.
Thanks to the identification and the extent of these factors of mobilisation, business managers can control, and anticipate their 'performance' and put their management of human resources "to the place".
They create a breeding ground to a concerted economic intelligence robust and effective.
Oslo speech: "just war" is due to the right to Obama
The American right welcomed Friday's speech on the eve in Oslo by Barack Obama, pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of America.
The Conservatives, who had brocardé awarding the prize to Mr Obama on October 9, applauded the presidential speeches, like Sarah Palin, former candidate for the vice-presidency during the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Mrs Palin, égérie the right-hand side of the Republican Party, the newspaper USA Today ', adding itself addressed the subject of war' sometimes necessary "in his memoirs that have just been published.
The war is obviously the last thing in my opinion that Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We must stop these terrorists everything out there, she felt.
Mr Obama, who has inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, has tried Thursday to Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan, nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr Obama, Newt Gingrich has estimated that the president had done in Oslo "very good job".
I found the speech was very well, welcomed the former president of the House of Representatives, who has particularly appreciated the mention of "The existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
By some side, I found this quite historic, said Mr Gingrich, asked at the radio programme 'The Takeaway. "
The former elected, regarded by some as a candidate at the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said that he is delighted to have seen "a president left" to remind members of the Nobel committee "that they would not be free and could not put a price of peace if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, a former boxer George W. Bush handed over in the Washington Post columnist, Mr Obama made "a very American."
In addition to present itself as "citizen of the world" as it always does', "he spoke as an American President", pointing out the European "that they live in a bubble of security that they have not created and they do little to preserve biodiversity," said Mr Gerson.
Among the few right not to be convinced, a hawk in the Bush era, the former UN Ambassador John Bolton, has described the speech "dull, spouted and inspiration" on the site National Review Online.
To the left of the president, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich has alarmed to see Barack Obama to justify the use of force.
When it is funding the war in the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the killing of innocent people, he warned.
The Press of centre-left remained, however, complimentary to the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr Obama, described his speech "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The speech of Oslo "should serve as a roadmap to guide the international decisions against the wars, poverty and oppression," has inflamed the Daily Californian.
Mr Obama "gave the speech he had", has estimated the New York Times, the judges' the dark and inspiring ".
Drivers: three marathons for an agreement that saves the supply of Christmas.
After three sessions of négociations-marathon, sector unions Road and TLF employers' organisation, only to be stayed until the end, arrived on Friday evening in a deal that puts an end to the strike and the threat to the supply of Christmas.
In the sitting signatures on Friday evening, secretary of state to transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "delighted" of this agreement, after several sessions of negotiations, launched on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of debate the negotiators were left in the morning on Friday, with the hope to sign soon after the morning the text of agreement.
Even if three employers' organisations (FNTR, unostra, otre) had been closed the door.
But it took even more than six hours of a meeting began at 11.00 so that everyone is agreed, and that at 6 p.m. the text is signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging for the companies' and 'it was feared that it will disrupt the Christmas holidays for years," said Mr Bussereau.
The text provides a salary increases of 4% for the lowest wages (in the road transport to local and regional), and 2.9% for the highest (international).
In the hourly rate for the bas-salaires, 'are 8,72 euros to 9,06.
It is not much, but it is very far, said Patrice closed (FO).
This is going to give the next to our activists that there was no obstacles, not to blockade the centres of supplies.
But there may still have some holdouts who are not happy, he added.
Philippe grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", even if it was "difficult to concede the increases on the senior salaries because of international competition."
According to him, the increases will be the order of 170 euros monthly for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and the respect of employees, said Maxim Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry douine (CFTC) has welcomed a "historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) has raised "a compromise acceptable".
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of travel costs of 3%, and the general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow us to address the issue of a 13th month and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau said that "a drop of 100 million euros in employers' contributions" was the subject of a government amendment to the bill to reform finance for 2009, voted in last Thursday night on Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in the same."
The signing of TLF means that the agreement is applicable in the first time companies adhérentes this organisation, and in a second time, to the entire profession, in case of extended by the Minister of Labour.
It will "soon", has assured Mr Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "fool" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised for the sector to offset some of the carbon tax."
The secretary of state to transport was forced to negotiate in the emergency, not in conclusion to a shared, but not to antagonise the chewing Turkey in the next party, has complained about the unostra.
For the otre the agreement is likely to deepen the grave of a large number of medium-sized businesses in the next 12 months ".
A: RER disruption this weekend, trade unions unhappy with proposals for the RATP
The disruption on the RER has the biggest line of public transport of France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting Friday in the second day of strike between unions and management of the RATP has left on their hunger as to their demand for premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend shopping before Christmas, there will be trains between 10.00 a.m.and 8 p.m., at a train on two on the central section (between defence and nation) and a train on four outside the central section.
The interconnection with SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre prefecture, which will require passengers to change.
The Galleries Lafayette, who expect 200,000 customers every day, were happy that "the RATP making efforts to serve the stores'.
The rer is crossing of the West is the city of Paris.
The stretch RATP short of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in boissy-saint-léger and Marne-la-Vallée.
On Friday, about a train on two circulated at peak times, and almost no rowed in empty hours, as planned.
As Thursday, there was no melee on the dock, the franciliens is being organised.
And in the morning, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, particularly because of lack of collégiens and pupils.
To boissy-saint-léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack nbakina, an engineer for 29 years ago, explained to be lifted "half an hour earlier, so be sure to arrive on time."
The station Saint-Lazare has not been saturated, said the SNCF, which had provided a framework of officials and security forces.
The rer is operated by the train from or to cergy-le-haut arrived or jaunt to the station Saint-Lazare to join the tube.
New general meetings of strikers will be held Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, found "disappointing" by the trade unions, a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The director of the RER is proposing to negotiate a special protocol for the RER has on all aspects, work, holding career etc.
This is not want drivers, who demand a premium because, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP is even its proposals for a premium, incidentally, was incensed the CGT, stressing that the leadership "was not kaput to solve a problem while in the road and the SNCF is done."
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for "a broader examination of the working conditions," said the RATP.
What was said to the unions that the company "is moquait users of the weekend".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a committee of establishment at the headquarters in Paris.
This is when the leadership, which refused until then any discussion during the strike, suggested "in order to appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to widen the RER B on Tuesday, after a warning by UNSA and independent.
The trade unions demand a premium of 120 euros (UNSA) to 150 euros which EUR 30 variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, independent) and complain of the deterioration of working conditions on that line the 1 million daily passengers.
The drivers of the RER, all in the second part of careers, have 2.200 to 2.700 euros and 600 to 650 euros in premiums, the Times odds, Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish courts dissolved the pro-Kurdish party decision with serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court said Friday the dissolution of the main pro-Kurdish party in the country, a decision that was immediately followed by expressions of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east and Istanbul.
This decision is likely to vastly complicate the task of the government, which has just reach out to the Kurdish community to try to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "hotbed of activities prejudicial to the independence of the state and its unity indivisible", told the press the president of the court Hasim kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was unanimous in the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven was required to make the dissolution, said Mr kiliç, adding that 37 senior party, its president, Ahmet türk and the Aysel Tugluk are banned from politics for five years ago.
The judge has also announced the closure of parliamentary immunity had enjoyed Mr and Mrs Tugluk türk and confiscated by the Treasury assets of the party.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that members would be moving out of parliament rather than to sit as members of parliament without a label.
The decision follows a process launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman yalçinkaya, which accuses the DTP to obey 'directives "of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the showcase legal policy of PKK rebels.
The party holds that it did "not organic ties" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and the government to negotiate with him.
The court's verdict comes as the government has just reach out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to stymie the support of Kurdish PKK and end the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had said that a collapse could lead to an escalation of tensions in the south-east anatolien, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
When the news of Justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the big city in the south-east populated by a majority of Kurds.
The police fired tear-gas grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators launched Molotov cocktails or stones, with slings.
One hundred people marched in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr türk said that the court ruling was "deepening despair."
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish ndlr) by banning a party, he said at the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, has also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, said the minister of energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a torpillage total of the Democratic opening launched by the government, has commented on the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers, three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the most lethal in recent months.
The first snows can
What would Wolfgang brauburger is a winter of rigorous.
But the head of service for too long and sablage roads (FES) makes it clear that this is not to annoy people.
This is simply for the agents can test the vehicle and learn to control them.
And after the métérologues, that could be for this week ending.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles is ready to tackle the snow and ice.
The FES follows a very elaborate plan.
Mr brauburger explains that when it starts to Neiger on the city of Frankfurt and temperatures are below zero, large vehicles to sablage travel 20 routes main (nicknamed routes).
This includes the streets on a large movement, the main arteries, as the Neue difficulties and the Hanauer landstraße.
Also included access to the firefighters, the routes of transport, the pedestrian areas and the streets in as the atzelbergstraße.
The agents of the FES starting their service for three hours of morning.
If necessary, no 1040 miles of roads must be salt with a dark road that adheres to 3 p.m. time limit.
This is why the service of Fes begins to 3H in the morning "so that the roads to be released when the trafficking of daily migrations."
Where it is becoming more difficult, it is when the snow to fall à7h30 in the morning.
This is causing problems, says the head of service for too long and sablage roads "because no driver is prepared to allow vehicles to salage."
Then, if it does nothing more, we are the roads of access and roads network - as the rat-beil-straße.
Secondary roads and streets latérales come last.
Mr brauburger knows that it is always a few complaints.
At 5 a.m., the team of Fes pedestrian is in motion for release in priority areas deemed dangerous and the passages.
On the bicycle paths, the services of Fes can rarely be dealt with.
Mr brauburger specifies that there is in Frankfurt, a service spécialqui deals to monitor the state bridges between 22heures and 4.30.
As the ice to form very quickly on this land, the vehicles of salage act as soon as the temperature falls below 2 degrees.
It also happens that the police appeals to the special service encas needed.
The birthplace of dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae looked the other carnivorous dinosaurs: this was bipède approximately 2 metres for 1,50m high, its members post were powerful, his skull lying was filled teeth acérées and recourbées, his short arms are terminaient through cracks in sickle and he had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, she would not have had nothing special.
But, as reports sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues in the magazine Science on Thursday, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these features morphologiques.
This animal was 215 million years in New Mexico who faisaità then part of land émergées of supercontinent, the pangée and was to Ecuador.
Sertling Nesbitt said that the discovery of Tawa sheds new light the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, it could comment on the relationship, the distribution and characteristics.
In 2006, sertling Nesbitt has undertaken searches in the company other paléontologues, on the site of gohst Crawford ranch in northern New Mexico
Randall irmis Museum of Natural History of Utah and member of the team searches have been told that they were sometimes find a dozen skeletal remains given in a day which is entirely unique for a layer sédimentaire dated Trias.
Scientists are very soon realised that a portion of the skeletal remains given belonged to a new species.
The excavation has revealed the remains of five specimens.
A discovery which confirms theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
Researchers have called on behalf of Tawa according to the word of the Indians Hopi for the Sun God.
For sterling Nesbitt, it is a quite exceptional discovery: the fossils of dinosaurs from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of bone incomplete.
All the experts in paléontologie do not share this enthusiasm.
For example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find that this discovery is particularly spectacular, but that it allows us to confirm some theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, the dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years.
Most of the fossils older, however, are fragmented and incomplete which makes it very difficult the classification of all first dinosaurs.
The experts are wondering about what time the sauriens are divided into three groups of evolution: the théropodes (carnivores) who understand the tyrannosaure and vélociraptor emerged later and take the birds, the sauropodes, quadrupedal animals in the long neck, and those who are related and the herbivores ornithischiens which are part of the species such as the Triceratops and stégosaure.
According to studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first théropodes.
This case presents an interesting features both primitive and developed, said S. Nesbitt.
Researchers have found evidence which suggests that the Tawa hallae possèdait small air bags in his bones in the skull, as the birds that are the descendants of théropodes.
These small pockets of air facilitate the breath of birds from the mammals.
It seems that among the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were partially met by air.
According to irmis Randall, the Tawa is one of the oldest théropodes with small air bags in his bones.
As the lines related to the immense sauropodes had also air bags and a backbone, you may think that their single common ancestor had already that innovation beneficial.
Three successive waves of migration to the North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs had lived in South America, researchers have concluded that the sauriens had occurred there.
So the three main lines of evolution are divided and have spread from South America to the rest of the world that is all the land émergées who formed the supercontinent pangée.
It seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paléontologues has also discovered the remains of two other théropodes which are not particularly brethren.
The three species can take a single common ancestor would have migrated, say researchers.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History of New York and co-author of the magazine science studies said that there would have had at least three waves of migration to the North America.
Of course there is a few inconsistencies.
Martin Sander, paléontologue in Bonn said that there is an even older, the silesaure, who lived in Poland and who belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him that could give a distorted view because there is in South America a large number of fossils of dinosaurs that have been preserved so that there is virtually no on other continents.
However, how the dinosaurs, they managed to become the dominant tétrapodes secondary to the era when ilsprovenaient collateral a relatively rare in the branch of the reptiles, is still a mystery.
At the time of Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as with the ancestors of present-day crocodiles and with many other sauriens.
Towards the end of Trias dinosaurs are spread across the globe promoting the development of many new species, while others were related, have disappeared between Trias and Jurassic.
Such a success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two assumptions.
There may have a mass extinction of dinosaurs survived randomly, while other reptiles have disappeared.
Then, the dinosaurs were better suited and so they could eliminate the competition on the ground.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a météorite favorisal' development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias, and since this time essentially in the shadows: it was mammals.
The solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories of the world.
There are those of teachers of the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, University of Vienna, or Berkeley in California.
There are those in charge of the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, of New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by the police of the casino J.W. Goethe University in Frankfurt made waves on the planet.
278 professors and teachers of the university J.W. Goethe but also other institutions of higher education in Germany, Europe and North and South America to express their solidarity with the student protestors of the Westend campuses.
In a statement drafted in German and English ilscondamnent intervention by the police requested by the steering committee of the university.
Last week, President of the university Werner müller-estler did evacuate buildings occupied by students and teachers in grèveaprès that walls and works of art have been daubed with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories to believe the damage did not justify "a speech by someone from the police raid against students and teachers who had held their own way".
The evacuation is an "unacceptable breach" of the freedom to research and education.
The focus exclusively on the acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitimize and declare the protest" and is trying to forget the mobilisation.
The steering committee of the university is removed the debates that would be but necessary.
Lecturers are demanding that the criminal prosecution should be suspended immediately.
The majority of occupants did not take part in damage.
Legitimate protests
The Young of the trade union Verdi services sector and the Confederation of German trade unions (DGB) to show solidarity among students.
The protests are only the expression of a growing concern for our own future, said Alexander Klein, regional secretary of young people from the trade union Verdi.
The minister of science of the land of Eva Hesse kühne-hörmann (CDU), she has sided with the action by the president of the university and the police.
We thank the president of the university.
Any occupation and degradation of places is totally unacceptable, she said the regional parliament Wiesbaden last Thursday at the television programme aktuelle stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, gave the CDU member of the regional parliament Peter beuth.
The groups of the opposition party, the Greens and the left (left) did not share this view.
The CSU is the excuse of a few walls peinturlurés to criminalise the protests, said Janine Wissler party of the left (left).
Instead, consider the arguments and claims of students, shrugs off.
The party to the left has tabled a motion which, after the interior minister to submit a report on conditions of the intervention of the police.

For a long time she had the reputation of city secret, banned the Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was under the Soviet regime, a place to search for the secret weapon, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216 000 people to 37 miles of the centre of Moscow, has the reputation of being the "Silicon Valley".
Major production sites and research into micro and nanoélectronique are implanted.
In September 2008 representatives of zelenograd created links with riedberg Mehr, place of science – with academic institutions and companies in the centre of innovations in Frankfurt (FIZ).
There was mutual and meetings with representatives of zelenograd last Wednesday and riedberg have ratified a "memorandum of close cooperation."
The signatories were the deputy mayor of Moscow Juri rosljak and the prefect Anatoly smimov of zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwartz head of section project for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, which the high point is scientific research, will leave to zelenograd for a seminar.
Trade scientific
It is an exchange of science.
But also economic relations.
It will enable companies of the FIZ to enter the Russian market is expanding rapidly.
Unlike the Russian scientists want to secure contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of institutions and companies for research Soviets famous.
There is the institute electrical engineering in Moscow, the big firms sitronics and rosssijskaja-elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as "socialist planned City" for research on arms.
Zelenograd (literal translation of "green city") takes its name of forested hills at the heart which research centres are located.
The project S21 a check for Stuttgart.
We cannot put enough the enormity of Stuttgart, 21.
For his supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe."
If you want. S21, that is far more than repositories of a railway station, more than a massive construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, chaos in a despairing of yards for a decade.
Stuttgart, 21, was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
The stations front line, with approaches that are terminaient in Full City, had a reputation at the time to be the relics of the technique of transport in the 19th century that were to Sabot brake rail traffic modern because it was once much time to get the engines of the back to before.
Arrival, stopping short, departure – this is what to do it.
This is why the stations front line must stop: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart, too: a station of passing trains, which is half-way around on the main rail trans-European between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava where the slogan "heart of Europe".
The project S21 will really start, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners have recognised that the cost to bury the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
Indeed, stations, the front line is more serious problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with autorails and voiture-pilote at both ends.
It is now the achievement of Stuttgart 21 alongside the new route of the inter-city line towards Ulm.
The policies of regional and municipal prevailed.
The company of the railways is in part because it is the taxpayer who paid the price of the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the public.
The point of view urban this project is relatively well.
You get an urban area who – according to graphics planners generated by computer – will be very verdoyant.
For the system of rail transport the S21 is harmful.
The station and the enlargement of the section are designed for a traffic from people that were - and this is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time it did not exist, the competition cheap flights.
The policy of the modern traffic should first focus on strengthening the transport of goods since the railways is much more environmentally friendly by lorry on the road.
But the new route, with its leanings, is not suited to freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the draft of the souabe.
It is the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion is more realistic.
One thing is safe, in the next decade the money involved in other nodes and congestion in the network.
The list of the transport ministry says at least 60 large projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section across the Rhine Valley of 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987, this line is built in slow motion.
It would really need to support here to the fungus.
But the project S21 made a Sabot braking.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck freight traffic International, and this in the heart of Europe.
The government is considering the judgment on the airport
The regional parliament in Wiesbaden, the national government has raised the possibility to appeal the judgment of the administrative court in Hesse with the ban on air flights at night.
The Minister of Economics Dieter Posch (FDP) has announced that the coalition CDU and FDP had entrusted experts to examine the legal point of view the ruling by the administrative court and which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Court of Kassel was justified in a written document that the land should adapt regulations regarding the ban on night flights in the case or the construction of the runway aterrissage north-west of the Frankfurt airport would be fulfilled.
The approval of attérir for 17 aircraft between 23h and 5.00 p.m. in the morning, as envisaged in the national government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against the night air pollution.
The coalition should be decided on 4 January if it wants to make an appeals process against the ruling.
The opposition criticism this time and trying to put pressure on the government representative for celui-cirenonce the appeal of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of group SPD Torsten schäfer-gümbel invites the CDU and FDP back to their promise before the elections and who was banned night flights. Otherwise, it will be condidéré as a total to a word.
It is sacrément difficult to be allowed to keep its word, said the leader of the greens Tariq al-Wazir alluding to the slogan éléctoral FDP "we keep our promises".
The minister Dieter Posch refute accusations of schäfer-gümbel which claims that the national government is trying to allow the night flights using "avocasserie and roublardises."
It takes time to carry out a legal review.
The coalition does not make decisions on the basis of a "rapid" first impression.
The decision is legally accountable, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition on the statements of his section on the night ban is completely érronée.
US banks repay the aid
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, have taken away from them their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had repaid in full at the Treasury $45 billion (more than 30 billion), equivalent to aid under the rescue plan relief.
The process of American television CNBC said in a report that Citigroup also envisaged to repay the aid received.
The banking institutions are trying to get rid of restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance of, such as limiting bonuses awarded to the leader and the regulation of higher charges.
The Bank of americaa launched a capital increase by the sale of securities from investors who told him 19 billion dollars of fresh money.
The rest of the money comes from the coffers of the Bank that have been met through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
On Wednesday evening last year, Kenneth Lewis, the director general of the Bank of America held to thank us taxpayers: the injection of capital has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution was suspected of its capacity by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of financial turmoil.
The Citigroup is also considering money on the financial markets to free themselves from the state.
The American bank could launch on Thursday a capital increase to $20 billion, reported quoting the process CNBC banking circles.
The spokesman for Citigroup did not comment on this information.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the money they received.
Election accelerated
Ultimately, it has nevertheless past faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current taking the post of chief redacteur Nikolaus Brender by the board of the German ZDF process, the successor is appointed.
The Commission wanted to vote last night for the nomination.
Peter Frey, who runs the Berlin ZDF was the odds-on favorite.
The process has not wanted to confirm, officially, the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there was also the desire not to further damage to the intendant ZDF Markus schächter if the proposal would not be accepted by the board.
Frey, who is the candidate of schächter, needs the votes of nine members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the conclusion of this edition.
Two weeks ago, schächter had proposed to the board to extend to five years, the contract of Nikolaus Brender but it was rejected.
Only 7 of the council members had signed for the renewal of Brender and 7 others had voted against the impeachment by vote of Brender represented a failure of that needed to schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority on the board had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not to renew Brender to his post.
It is Roland Koch, the premier of Hesse, who had organised a league against the editor.
He had rejected the contract on the esteemed redacteur chief will be extended, citing the fact that the rate of listening to the emissions of information the ZDF had fallen under Brender.
This is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, lashing out at the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
At the end there was even 35 law experts who had stepped into the debate and felt that the way Koch was unconstitutional.
But it will have achieved nothing.
Peter Frey: Who is it?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 to Bingen.
He has studied the sciences-politiques, education etles romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the südwestfunk (body Radio of Rhineland-Palatinate) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily national significance).
In 1983 it is editor in the ZDF first on the news magazine "heute-journal '(paper today).
Then her journey continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy rédacteur-en-chef at the time; and corresponding to Washington in 1991 and 1992, and until 1998 he was head and host of "morgenmagazins' (emission of information bimensuelle presented the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the service of foreign policy of the ZDF and then head of Berlin.
After the disgrace of Brender when it had just been elected journalist of the year in the short-run Magazin medium, the Greens have announced they laid down a complaint constitutional
The enemy of Koch on board, the prime minister of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the states should turn the intergovernmental treaty the ZDF so that the proposals of the intendant may not be blocked by a majority politically biased.
However, Beck has no plans to ask the withdrawal of politicians members of committees overseeing the ZDF.
Peter Frey, the likely successor to Brender was ably manœuvré with the board in criticising the Commission strongly in its decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to the evidence of journalistic independence, schächter was able to propose for the post of rédacteur-en-chef without losing face, the board was elected without the soupconne put a partisan politics.
In the mathematical representations of parties, Frey is classified as liberal, left-wing.
High up in the academic studies
Partial success for students: After a year to strike the ministers of education, educational and cultural affairs land decide to be more accommodating: during a meeting between ministers and representatives from the conference of vice-chancellors, an agreement has been developed that working conditions of students bachelor and masters degree should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to overcome their studies.
They are, in particular set of accordpour lighten the burden of exam: a single study should help to close the module to study.
The burden of work will be reconsidée to ensure "a realistic and acceptable."
The government policies and institutions of higher education to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The states have also pledged to hold joint structural requirements more flexible for the networks of bachelor and masters.
Regionally, should not be sufficiently different from land to another.
Less than examinations
Since the beginning of student protests in June, the education minister land and the chancellors universities have repeatedly in the mouth the expression on the way: "étudiabilité."
But for the first time, it seems to take a practical significance.
The Accreditation Council has decided to slash the number of some tests: "Each module should normally be reached by a single examination," we read in a document of thirty pages on the future conditions of entry to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, president of the Accreditation Council says that by far the burden of tests should be able to stop the disruption, hurting considerably in the étudiabilité.
"étudiabilité 'should also be in future, the benchmark of the organization of studies.
The modules as the substance must be examined carefully to see if we cannot prevent this feeling of stifling that it feels sometimes in the choice of course.
Hamburg / Berlin - the latest knowledge in a raid on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the leeway to allow and encourage the personal initiative".
The new regulation will include access to new rounds, academic, but will also be adapted to the existing cycles.
These cycles must be "réaccrédités" every 5 years, which means, however, that only by 2015 that all the rounds have been examined.
There are 10 accrediting agencies responsible for the entire federal territory that depend on Accreditation Council created by the land.
In October, the ministers of education had exerted some pressure on the land so that they are weighing on the agencies so that the programmes are not too busy and the regime exams, not too strict.
In some states, universities and colleges and have already heard from their regional prosecutors to take appropriate action.
The Rhineland-Palatinate so far is the only land to have agreed to give more money to the development of Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organise programmes tutorielset strengthen the offices of teaching guidelines and the offices of the service of international relations.
The states and universities provide a budget of 10 million euros.
In early 2010, the government wants to make Parliament an amendment to the law on the institutions of higher education.
Following this, there will be no more than one exam to complete his studies.
The Organization of studies will be more flexible, more needs to be able to guarantee the recognition of the records of notes other institutions of higher education and access to the Masters degree should be simplified.
By the end of next year, "étudiabilité" of all academic cycles will be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and opposition once again have debated the question of study conditions in the country.
The décisionsont been appreciated but criticisms have been heard.
The federal president of the Union students Socialists has indicated that it would like the Organisation for educational policy does not happen again in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and the vice-chancellors of universities.
In later after the strike educational, students as people should be able to speak a little.
The future diplomés higher education they received the support of the president of delegates to the conference of vice-chancellors (hrk) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful," she said Thursday during a meeting with the ministers of education, land with which the hrk working on a reform project.
For the Union of education and science (gew) the decisions taken in Bonn does not go far enough. It is demanding the right and the possibility for each graduate bachelor to put on a cycle of Masters.
Andreas Keller steering committee member of the gew request that the states provide students bachelor today, tomorrow there will be enough places for studies at the Masters and the conditions of studies as good as possible.
The states need to hire more responsible.
However, the ministers of education have not raised the possibility to ease access to the Masters.
More than a note at the bottom of page on Herta Müller
It is with the words' arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control... "that begins a work of the poet Werner söllner, in which he thématise in slabs of phrases troubling, the experience of a dissident arrived in Germany who won the freedom but lost in its territory.
Werner söllner, born in 1951 to Banat in Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and, subsequently, director of collectors in a publishing house for youth before moving to Frankfurt.
Söllner received several literary prize, in 1993 he was very popular the professorship of poetry of Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002, it is director of the forum of literature in Hesse with the house of artist of mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He has done a lot of him in literary circles not last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "the German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your files Securitate."
Obviously disturbed and embarrassed, söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow writers germano-roumains as Richard Wagner, William totok, Franz hodjak, and Mr frauendorfer he had worked as an informant for the police policy Securitate.
Söllner received in 1989, the price of the German language in conjunction with some of the participants.
The tests for recruitment had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, "concludes söllner so someone who has not sufficiently resisted auxessais intimidation of the Securitate."
The poet Werner söllner is the informant Walter (Im Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoration Nobel prize for Herta Müller and his battles literary star with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken, and especially the community of writers Germans from Romania, for a case which clearly shows the abyss and the heinous act of a political system, based on police surveillance and intelligence.
Werner söllner is, as we can say after the current knowledge, not just guilty but also a victim.
In his own dossier Securitate, Im Walter has played a role, the specialist literature Michael Markel after the confession of söllner and it refers to the positive influence of Im Walter, who had intervened in his favour.
"It had been drawn from all the difficult situations at the time," according to Markel.
Markel felt the need moralde make this comment.
The form in which söllner made his statement and before the public was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident its cooperation with the Romanian Intelligence Service is in fact, not so surprising.
Germany is a reserve for the spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the journal "Die Zeit, having read the 914 pages of his own case.
We can assume that the victims have been speculation and will have guessed what real names, sometimes hiding last names of loans Sorin, voicu and Walter.
In contrast to Germany where time between the consultation of the Stasi process is a reliable, the attitude to the legacy of the files of the Securitate is still very confused.
A systematic investigation has been repeatedly frustrated and slowed down in the past.
This is that in 1999 that a National Council for the institution Birthler was created to work the assimilation of archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) but the return of cases has dragged on since.
Is there since 2005, a law that defines the management of the archives.
As the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very much, is confirmed by the interview a former head of the Securitate to temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, by way of trés dismissive of the winner.
She had a psychosis, and ultimately had been questioned only once.
The shame of power to speak here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Certainly, unavoidable questions are involved in the case söllner as it happens so often in a context of guilt hidden.
Why now?, which has been robbed? the reaction of the listeners, according to söllner, gives us hope that the next chapter will be defined more by a desire to know that by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received yesterday, the Nobel Prize, is more than a note at the bottom of page.
Storms in the Champions League
We had the impression that a representative was there, best from any right to a celebration of Christmas nice, on which the manufacturer of sporting goods had displayed its goods when the new coach VfB Christian Gross Monta at midnight the quarter in a Mercedes C Class, he had just called, a plastic bag, Orange, the supplier.
The man, whose skull chauve drew the attention, allowed himself to lead in the city that he was still.
Otherwise our quinquagénaire could take the wheel – it was not drunk alcohol and it was not intoxicated happiness.
He had spent an evening pleasant but tomorrow we needed to resume work.
Because it is now that it would start.
The words of Switzerland that we had to take three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the final eight of," it is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni Romania ’ but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success. It will be a brutal struggle not to fall back. "
"The great work," We expected Sunday.
There, it is repeated in Mainz, the results of the Champions League.
And it will overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three goals a hasty to Marica (5.), träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Draw
The eighth of final of the Champions League (match go 16. / 17. + 23. / 24 February / return match 9. / 10. + 16. / 17. March) will be drawn to the 18. December to Nyon.
The joy of taking office fulminante the successor to Babbel was moderate.
And the joy was not moderate only for those who brought a chance, who had sent to Stuttgart destabilised, a highly motivated and fun to play.
I was seeing the players and I told them that they should concentrate on their strengths, I have advised to be more courageous, expliqua the plumber 'souls' – Gross, the recipe for success that was so bienmais which was more effects with the soigneur Babbel.
It has triggered a certain magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - in favour of Babbel - "in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that we would never have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of pause to injury, avança among the best player, thanks to its dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" seen by a proverbial ‘ Wind of Change "and working methods of the new leader:" It is someone who takes action and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
But apparently Babbel had failed.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet over the course, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart are in need of tenacity.
Just as Gross, the players and the manager tightlipped about overstate the victory against a defense completely out of date and weakened the guests Romanians.
They had also won in Glasgow before I had four days later a bad awakening to Leverkusen with 0: 4, objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, signala that they had actually reached the objectives of the season but they were others who were still far away.
We have not yet past the difficult hurdle.
That Heldt the day of his 40th birthday was not the heart to celebrate, even after the first victory at home for three months, is at the weekend's events as a television interview of the Guardian of Jens Lehmann did pick up just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others are not Jens, contrecarrait Heldt, in response to the criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the direction of weakness in style and said she had decided a change of coach under pressure from fans pubertaires.
Lehmann was judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele his day of free after the game he was removed.
The statements of Lehmann were "marked by a pure self-interest" slid Heldt and announced the consequences for the Guardian of purpose.
They were more to become friends for life in these two quadragénaires.
In any cast, they were in agreement for the rest, is to say that without the work of the group by the coach replaced, the strong sports representation and combative would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants have been "largely a success" in the rétorquèrent Heldt and Lehmann United – and even the rights to the plastic bag acquiesça.

The case Kunduz
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the green group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Defence Minister Guttenberg lie in the case of the case Kunduz.
The SPD and the left (left) to ask the Chancellor of the explanations.
Hamburg and Berlin, after considering the latest information on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition has accused the minister of defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) to have délibérémentdissimulé some facts.
The minister has intentionally, "a fiction" on the deadly attack two camions-citernes in September, said the leader of the green group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday over the release of information to the process' ard Tagesschau "(The Journal of 20h).
This means that he lied.
The order of killing has been given to disregard the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (Isaf).
It is, in essence, the report available to NATO and has been read by Mr Guttenberg Trittin, has said.
Last Friday, according to new revelations of the media, the aim of lafrappe was in reality, not to destroy the stolen trucks, but sought to eliminate two major Taliban leadership.
According to the inquiry report of NATO, 142 people were killed or injured during the attack American airline which was launched at the request of Colonel German Goerg Klein, commander of military Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the left have called on Saturday, Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to vote as soon as possible before the federal parliament and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin, and his colleague from the Green Party Renate künast believe that Mrs Merkel must make clear if the strategy of killing targeted is part of the Afghan policy, the government fédéralet if the chancellery, army and intelligence services have approved the new strategy.
The government spokesman categorically rejects the criticism.
The chancellery has in no Facon influenced the interventions of the military in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, the voices were increasingly strong to express doutesquant the real reasons the referral of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter wichert was presented by the ministry.
According to the intelligence of the newspaper Spiegel, the information they had handed over to Guttenberg on the attack tankers were both accurate and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of NATO and hid the minister details troublesome.
In the entourage of two senior officials, it suggests, however, they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a document of two pages of Colonel Klein, and a report of the military police.
"The Frankfurter allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reported that" wichert would have meanwhile called for in a letter a clarification of the facts.
Until now, it has received no reply
On Saturday, the ministry did not want to comment on these accusations, and sent to the commission of inquiry of the federal parliament which would be the next Wednesday to dapporter light on the facts.
The worlds of dream
Some see, while awake, images and voices that nobody else sees or hears.
It is not only among patients with mental health or under the effect of drugs, that the boundaries between fantasy and reality are mixed.
While these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is going very well.
When we are lying down in our bedrooms overshadowed, we can operate without barriers to dreams and the wildest fantasies.
However, awake, the experience of dream, hear and see things that others do not perceive, has quickly reputation in the Western world to be mad or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices are not that among patients with mental or under the effects of drugs.
It is our imagination that is in question: is the same activity neuronale which allows us to design houses, painting tables or write novels, but sometimes prompts the boundaries between the dream, madness and the reality to vanish.
A state of Awakening aware, taking the shape of a dream, can stand in the most diverse, at best it is called visions, the worst of madness.
But even if the cause and effect distinguish themselves, the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the experiences of drugs in the prophet of the new age Carlos Castaneda member drawings of chamanes, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to the process very similar.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance of substances neurotransmettrices brain - first the dopamine, the noradrenalin, serotonin and achétylcholine - breaks down and that the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
The hallucinations and délirantes complex thoughts are very often during a psychosis, schizophrenic.
The pull on earth has more power over the person.
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked on the relationship between the madness and the dream.
For Aristotle, the hallucinations were a form of rêve-éveillé; Wilhelm griesinger, a founder of modern psychiatry, found in 1861, "a great similarity between the madness and the dream" for Sigmund Freud the dream was "a psychosis, with all irregularities, imagination, delusions and illusions sensory who made up."
We are in the autumn of 2001 when Henning t turned into a figure of a comic strip.
His body is in two dimensions to the criardes colours.
The attraction on earth has more power over him, there is to flood the ceiling.
It is a blow.
Behind him ailées creatures on earth, grimaçantes, the bloody, showing its teeth.
They are, give it little feet with heavy boots, the flamboyantes cast against the walls, it feels the pain throughout the body.
The voice over grand, evil, howl, leaving the walls and radio.
It can no longer the bear these voices who revile and humiliating.
Henning T. snatched two cables to its chain stéréo, in fact a circle and attaches to a crochet set the ceiling.
It gets on a baffle and goes on the circle around the neck.
It is clear.
The circle stands out.
This reflects a lesson, mouthing the voice in a chorus to extract the tympan. "is in a clinic and fais-toi cure!"
Today Henning T. 40 years he lived six psychoses acute, the last 2 years, the first of nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is maniaco-dépressif, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he married for three years ago.
During the fear I have experienced the fears terrible and despondency deep.
Illusions are a harsh reality.
Around one percent of the population suffers from at least once in his life of schizophrenia in clinics and hospitals that is the most common illness after the Depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, people can no longer make the difference between the world and the outside world, they are in a state of wildly excitement, they may suffer from hallucinations, of megalomania, madness relationnelle or persecution.
It is very easy to hear voices – people who order, which elicited comments or dialogue.
The optical hallucinations are not rare either.
The person can no longer distinguish between the large and small, the brain can no longer to filter the signals troublemakers, the conscious is deluged with sensations.
As the dream, the hype opens the floodgates to a tide of ideas and fantasies, the deeper layers of conscience.
The perception of reality into the hype is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of department of psychiatry of Chu in Heidelberg (Allgemeine psychiatry Im universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is in the centre of the situation, meaning that focuses on him.
Meanwhile, he is in a passive role, it is a dream, overcome by the events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why the schizophrenic often feel threatened, inspected and manipulated.
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust the reality, the illusion is a harsh reality, wake up is excluded.
To experience once in his life of a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the structure sensory and space of the reality that is seen during the hype, is fundamentally retained".
The thoughts and hallucinations délirantes are based on reality and alienation of lived in a real framework.
Why our brains do this kind of ’, is always a puzzle for scientists.
Exceptional situations can get everyone to lose at the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people develop a psychosis.
There seems to have a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies of twins have shown that genes are not the only factors.
The researchers suspect that those involved to tiny brain damage.
We assume that the neuronale maturation of the brain is distraught at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what is still unexplained, was how the anomaly of the neuronal happens and also the fact that it is not for many years.
The environmental factors also play a role – the stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, however, if there is predisposition.
Of even the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger of psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brains chauffe.
This is crazy, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck is that the psychotiques suffer from hallucinations and take their medicines costly to unravel when others are buying drugs very expensive for obtaining them.
The perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a point of view.
Kasten together for ten years of reports of hallucinations and phenomena of images of make-believe: last year he published his findings in a book entitled "the imaginary world in our heads".
The hallucinations do well among the concomitant phenomena is typical of psychoses but also an impressive number of many other diseases.
There are some psychological problems as borderline or depression but also the headache, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or the trauma crânien.
It is surprising to see that under certain conditions even the brains of people healthy is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consists of fragments of memories that are normally inhibés.
They are taking shape when the brain areas who treat the sensory perceptions are HyperActives or not enough refrénées; when our brains chauffe but also when there is lack of stimulation.
The drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or a psychosis.
But the lack of stimulus, stress, much misery of love or other mental states exceptional.
In recent studies, one third of participants acknowledges having at least once in his life experience of a hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. 16 years ago, she lives a small town of Pomerania earlier and it goes to school.
A girl to do everything normal to tell the truth.
If there was not the images and voices.
In the playground, it is that a young boy, thin, with long hair châtain, send him to speak.
When it meets his comrades watch, surprised – nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They believe that this girl timid is a rêveuse lunatic but Sarah K do not dream, it is certain.
It is led, hear and see this boy just as it sees and hears the daughter who is sitting next to it on the bench.
It can even see its presence temporarily.
It is a feeling good, it found that young sympathetic.
Am I crazy?, asks it sometimes.
But she knows that this young and the other models are not real and that they will disappear again.
The night the outbreaks are, in general, frightening.
Often the visions are cumbersome.
When it is in class, sometimes it can follow the course because the professor is just trying to present a new pupil in his eyes and ears when it is invisible to others and that the professor is obviously going to explain the equations in the picture.
The night the outbreaks are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of his house, it expects the sleep, which happens all too rarely and far too late, it often cannot distinguish if it is being stirred or dream already, if the images that it sees, faces grimaçants or the girl with sanguinolentes cuts on the arms and legs before his eyes open or closed.
Let me calm, asking it to these creatures.
It does not speak to his parents or friends, they would for a crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. now has 20 years ago.
It has had his box last year and she lives with his friend.
A year ago the hallucinations have ceased.
Since it came in contact via the Internet with the psychologist Kasten she knows she is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough incentives, the likelihood is that it has hallucinations after some time.
I suppose that the brain is not quite busy, means that there are like.
Sarah K., daughter, was afraid of other children when it was small and was often alone.
Its hallucinations began when she learned to 13 years, that the man she called Daddy, since she was in age, was not his real father.
This is the same brain areas that are active in the visual hallucinations and noise, and the impressions and there are real, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah k to make the difference between the illusion and reality. "every experience," according to Kasten "takes place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are the images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real. "
For Kasten night, the dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are no different fundamentally of psychoses acute.
Unlike the schizophrenic, the person mentally healthy is able to recognise that the fantasies are not the pictures are real.
This is why Kasten advises her patients to cherish the hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is a step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on the conscience has unfortunately been quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for ailments, according to Michael schmidt-degenhard, professor at Heidelberg clinic and a doctor's chief of psychiatry and psychotherapy hospital Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
The scare is a serious illness, painful but which also contains something positive, creator – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-degenhard has studied the form of so-called oniroïde experience, a particular form of the amendment to the conscience being stirred by the dream.
The experienced oniroïdes are semi-rêves very complex, which are seen as real in the lives and that it cannot differentiate the dream even when it is in a state of awakening.
The state of consciousness oniroïde occurs during a trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathie which fully aware, have a paralysis.
According to schmidt-degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of itself and the world, due to a total failure and move it replaces the real situation which undermines his life by its own fantasy world that is separated from reality.
It is a state of mental limit between the dream and the hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world has all but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is a form of resources and interpretation, in a situation in itself intolerable, the ability of organisation which is given to men, not to sink in the ruins of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memories.
The zurichois Peter Classen Cornelius, art historian also describes his experiences oniroïdes in his book "change of heart" as action to safeguard the soul.
It has 49 years, when her aware of a journey of several days after the operation of a corneas with a transplant, meanwhile, his body is doomed to stand still in being resuscitated.
Claussen plunges into a world that it has created, visit the places foreign trip in time. It is as old man bed in a sanatorium rail, a robot in his mind on his health care.
He lives in the middle ages of the noble manufacturing drugs based on blood.
It is kidnapped by a Greek to Moto who goes in his country, it surfe with his hospital bed in the névé the Alps and meeting a Korean Mafia.
It absorbs completely in this world, everything is real, even later in his memories.
According to Claussen these domestic travel differ fundamentally from any dream.
The dream is a quite different, he writes in describing what he has lived.
Instead of dreams, the memories from the mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
You could say that they are much more and more intensive than the experience.
The intensity of this experience is breaking out the horizon of our other everyday experiences, according to the psychiatrist schmidt-degenhard.
Ultimately, the oniroïdes delusions, hallucinations, psychoses and experiences psychédéliques show our representations of reality outside are fragile, even in Eve.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist Kasten "can cause a distortion of what we call the reality."
An experience that can be quite enriching.
The first snows can
Burda
For 27 years, children will take the continuation of the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of editions Burda is an interim solution: more long-term, Hubert Burda hope that his two children are taking a group of press, he told the newspaper Spiegel.
The holding company must remain 100% with a family business.
Hamburg, has long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will become the lot for 27 years and are committed to integrate the company, said Hubert Burda, 69, Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will come later.
It will also see if they are capable of.
We cannot impose their children to 7,500 employees without knowing whether they have the ability to look at it.
This démolirait children as well as the company.
Burda said last Thursday that it is pulling out of the post président-directeur-général in January and that his successor was paul-bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years, is a member of the board since 1999.
It was primarily responsible for the technology.
Later he held the Treasury is to say he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen todenhöfer it took the head of marketing, foreigner, the impression and finance.
And for the first time this is not a family member who is head of Burda versions.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years, his son Felix, which would have now 42 years, died a few years.
The nommination of Kallen also serves to make the connection of the 10 or 15 years. "
Burda specifies that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in the families who have been causing a compulsive desire for capital, which have made enormous speculation unfortunate in thinking that they could grow ever higher.
It was never my strategy.
I have never been rêvede universal power, said Burda.
I am absolutely not in the role of précepteur as could be Springer and I do not intend to be part of the leagues international as the time, these companies have taken too much importance.

It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.

But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the uptake of electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville come join the project.
It is the three cities chosen by the government, under the movele plan to launch the introduction of electric cars.

Zapatero predicts "a future peace for the sector of the engine."
The president, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees a future of peace "for the automotive industry that, he pointed out, is the main export business.
During the presentation of the economic report of the president of the government for 2009, Zapatero has said the measures taken by the executive during the year in support of the automotive sector.
"Without a plan of competitiveness in the automotive sector, we have today a landscape of abandoned, closure of some of our main production sites," said the president of government.
"With this plan and the decision of brands to remain in Spain, in a very competitive, we can see a future peace for the future of this industry, which is our main export business," he added.
In this direction, he pointed out that the level of competitiveness, including the full plan for the automotive sector (PIA), has devoted 800 million euros to 19 manufacturers and 137 ancillary businesses, which mobilized an investment of more than 3,000 million euros.
The chief executive said that this investment was intended both to the development of new models to the modernisation of products and processes that already exist.
Zapatero has also emphasised the Government measures to support the request, referring to 2000e plan, developed in collaboration with the autonomous communities and the car companies.

Mazda3 i-stop a lasting sporting spirit.
Saloon intends to prove that the spirit of sport is not angry with respect to the environment.
À this effect, it has to take on the Mazda3 the system to stop and start the engine, called i-stop, a device which, at least for the moment, is available only on the gasoline engine 2.0 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the note that it has achieved in its entirety.
The details, finishing the vehicle, the board, the behaviour, the mechanics, the system i-stop...
All these aspects are remarkable in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the post of conduct, it appears that fronts the seats have a workplace ergonomics and setting excellent.
The touch the steering wheel is also very pleasant.
By continuing with the whole formed by the Board of Control and say, we see how saloon has continued in the trend of Japan to create a futuristic design of interior, with many buttons and orders, and the vivid colors, red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, the Honda Civic.
This is why we can say that both the Mazda3 that the Civic, all of two Japanese, contrast with the brevity of German products, particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, everyone wants to overtake.
By continuing with the systems, the Japanese car packed with a board more than enough to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to this great boot on regular.
The system of automatic and start the engine, at least for the moment, is available only on the gasoline engine of two litres and 150 horses and change manual of six speeds.
This engine is a true happiness. It is illustrated by his finesse, his low noise, its benefits and control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the Mazda3 most requested the diesel models, those who are not a large number of miles per year should not rule out this i-stop with motor gasoline, both for his great comfort to speed its consumption.
On the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the sport, which has the highest number of elements of series.
Among the series, the assistant to change of direction (RVM) who kills the spot, the controls of traction and stability, the regulator, the mirror inside photosensible, on-board computer on a screen of large size, the parking sensors, the air conditioning independent, the capteur of rain and light, the Bluetooth and Bluetooth audio, and the wheels of alignment of 17 inches, are particularly remarkable.
Moreover, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the pack schedules, which, for €1,500 more, includes, among other elements of adaptive headlights bi-xénon and an audio system with charger Bose record.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best cars compactes its category.
It is especially by the quality of materials used by his behaviour and by his level of high.
Moreover, those who do not travel many miles per year will be able to choose the version i-stop involved only at the gasoline engine 2.0 150 horses.
The only drawback of the model is its high price, which lies between 21 770 euros for finishing luxury and 23 270 euros for the model tested, the sport.
In return for this large sum, the Mazda3 will give us every day a large dose of satisfaction.
"first luxury."

The promise of fonpeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a mechanism which allows only to watch his e-mail, without offering the possibility if only to see some type of attachments or surf the Internet.
He tabled its five minutes of glory to the États-unis when TIME magazine the act as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see him in the streets, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, peek offers a monthly subscription price and a very low - less than half of what it costs, for example, the subscription data to the iPhone.
Given his success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, another with a free service data to life, for six times more expensive than peek.
Fonpeek presented yesterday at the event the Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is also limited his grand-frère American, but there is a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what is the fact of the data when you cross a border or desperately seeking a cafeteria on the WiFi (or a connection to FON) to check his e-mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and as long as it should operate.
Indeed, some operators have special arrangements and options, but for me, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated reminders to the European Commission to propose roaming fees affordable across Europe have had a barely perceptible.
À outside his home country, people hesitate to use the data, and it was not wrong.
Only a small device as the fonpeek (it is always curious that it is FON when he has no WiFi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are starting to think differently and are considering various proposals to increase their network of data.
Kindle is another good example, he understands the download books and other research on the Internet.
Without a subscription and soup.
It is a piece logged on and we are paying at its purchase and not every month.
And this is what I hope to see a day for the fonpeek: an option to purchase with access to life as the Peek is already the États-unis.
Not that I want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I would simply because I believe that the phrase is more fair to the consumer.
This would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The favourite colour of Michelle
The yellow is probably the favourite colour of the first lady of États-unis.
If it went to the inauguration of Barack Obama in the États-unis with a penitent and a mantle of this colour, it has chosen the same to accompany it in the second time, without doubt, the more important to his life: the award in Oslo, the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama was a model very similar to those two occasions: in addition to their colour ressemblante, drawing a yellow to green with reflections bright, both times, consisted of three parts: the penitent, jacket and the coat, in the same tissues, and was ornée of great broderie or a string.
So a first glance, it seems that the first lady of États-unis follows the aftermath of the Princess of Asturias and chose to get the same held.
But the fabric in which are carved up the two sets of makes them very different.
If the assumption of office, it was a delicate manoeuvring chunky, however, it was printed in Oslo a velvet.
Accessories are also different: green shoes to Achilles means for the first opportunity, and a similar pattern, but, this time.
The salon she too has changed: The hair is now met while she was abandoned last time.
75% of working mothers have had problems because of their fertility professionals
Discrimination at work has risen in recent years, especially for women, young people who want to be mothers.
It is that the study "fertility and career women in Spain," carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto the Mujer.
The inquiry, carried out on 9 737 women from 15 to 75 years, leaves no doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen their careers are limited because of motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of life in a couple and the number of children, if the woman is working or not, and the type of employment occupied.
Those who did not work outside the home, work part-time work or have a more stable, to come earlier in the couple, have their first pregnancy sooner and more children.
However, women with a stable job, mainly in the public sector, have rejected the entry in the couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
The women between 35 and 49 years ago with a work sets have their first child, on average 3.7 years after being installed as couples. This figure rises to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector. "these data show that women who have a stable job was needed more time in their lives to get, which has led to repel the union and the arrival of children.
The type of job exerted influence largely motherhood, but not the beginning of life together, "explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widening the gap in the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the investigation, the level of training is high, the more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference remains as among the women of the same generation.
For example, in the group having between 35 and 49 years, those with basic and higher than have been mothers respectively for the first time to 25,1 and 32,1 years on average.
"Another disctinction is also among women, according to their level of studies.
While those who have done studies elementary marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have done studies of average level or above reverse this programme and give priority to obtain a stable job as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child, "says Mrs Delgado.
Diane Kruger also well worth
The Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its list jalousée of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
À from next year, the German actress will embody the image of several products of the words the universal currency "because my wife.
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the players the most elegant of the international stage, just as well join other celebrities included among the Oréal Paris, as Linda Evangelista, Jane found, Andy MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before it, the last to enter this club if select were actresses Evangeline Lilly (lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog millonaire).
Among men, the brand of cosmetics account of the ambassadors of luxury: Patrick Dempsey (DRE grey, lessons in anatomy) and Matthew Fox (the companion of Evangeline in lost).
The price of the British fashion
The British have much to say in the world of fashion.
Its biggest representatives, creators and mannequins, yesterday and today, gathered for the award for the annual price, which took place in London at the Royal short of justice.
Nobody has missed the meeting.
The former mannequin Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger elected best mannequin this year.
The gamble of Ace of Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers in poquer of ases (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) to 30 "radiographies" of writers who have crossed his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
It does not according to gender predictable and apprehended (short biographique, life and work), but in seeking something similar to the core of ignition of the character created.
The trip is exciting and Vincent spares or the fear or the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, the paper is also an invitation moving the readings and relectures.
I leave you here a few snapshots.

A cowardly attack
Last week, my mother, who has about 70 years ago, last days strolling round in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent as part of it and our dog, a sang-mélé, saved the APS and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they assenèrent two shots of feet which left the dog seriously injured.
Our outrage is huge because we do not see that there are fun to attack free of charge a small animal defenceless, moreover, was in leaves.
It is in addition to the outrage of a lady who quietly last days strolling round and, when she injuria these individuals, came to fear for their physical, as a énergumène attacking an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, a burden and, ultimately, any person lower than him.
The episode came at 5 p.m. on Tuesday as another in a district usually quiet.
The dog has gémi all day.
Of course we have filed complaints in the office of the neighborhood, even if we doubt that it is used to much, and not to touch the sensitivities, we want to just say that the cowardly killers were Spanish.
Outrage led to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people to find amusing to mistreat animals without charge, a defence which gives us love, friendship and keeps US airline.
We do not know where is the good education and the respect of animals and people.
Michelin and fesvial, sets for wearing the headphones
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish foundation for road safety (fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmets, mainly among motorcyclists youngsters, said today the two structures.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the headphones, since it is the only element of protection to prevent injury to the head, or even death, in an accident in two wheels.
Michelin has indicated that this campaign was in line with his commitment to road safety, "goes beyond the design and manufacture products more safe" and said that it contributed to this goal by other actions to educational and informative.
This new campaign of encouragement from the port of the helmet on two wheels, under the slogan "to be but not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages of motorcycles, in order to ensure the widest audience.

The sale of light commercial vehicles is
After nearly two years ago, the market for light commercial vehicles are beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain is an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more important, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the trade union business sectors of the manufacturers Anfac and ganvam, the dealers.
However, it should be set against the good news since the reference to the comparison, the November 2008, has been particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the event last month, registrations accumulated during the 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if you add all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from cars, a, fourgonnettes, fourgons light and light trucks) Windows 95 853 have been sold.
The big clouds that affect the more their requests have not provided. Indeed, although they are also bought by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized businesses, which pay in almost 100% of cases, thanks to an external funding.
And, more restrictions involved by limiting the bank loans, other factors such as the increase in unemployment and the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this situation and unlike cars, aid to the purchase of the 2000e have little used.
In addition to individuals, the self-employed and small businesses who want to acquire a commercial vehicle slightly less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that no more than 160 grams per kilometer, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, in ganvam, recalled the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and industrial vehicles (lorries and buses).
The Association of dealers provides for a year 2010 similar to that which is, for which she found a drop in sales of passenger cars and 4x4s) of 19%.
The emergency braking is now obligatory
As has occurred with the system anti-lock brakes abs and it will take place with the ESP stability control systems for aid to the emergency brake will be a compulsory part on European cars.
They are already mandatory in cars and light commercial vehicles, while newly registered for the rest of vehicles, a period of weakness has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by his mode of action, it can also help prevent many rear shocks.
The assistant emergency braking is increasing pressure on the brakes in urgent cases detected in the system through the kick to set by the driver.
But it does not maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident had not been able to rely on the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from its full force.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of aid, in Revancha, requires the brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to a study of the EU, if all cars were fitted with this type of elements, until 1 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with popularizing the so-called intelligent systems emergency braking: it is calculated that a sinister on four with the injured would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera, detect obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to act slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it means increasing pressure on the putting, if necessary.
If it does not act, and although the collision is inevitable, the facility is the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors postponed until January the plan for Opel
While workers from Opel's Figueruelas plant (Zaragoza) have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) for the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably the 8 –, according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the plan to rescue Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, each of the plan was approved in advance by the relevant section.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be first submitted to the workers and the governments of countries where the factories, be postponed until early 2010.
However, GM, it ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
