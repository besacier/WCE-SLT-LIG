surgeons in los angeles have said that they were outraged said mr camus 
i heard about a possible further judicial proceedings has t he says 
jean claude camus has estimated that johnny hallyday party was much too quickly to los angeles with the permission of the surgeon parisian 
i had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and i was amazed given that i have had me even two hernies discales has t it added 
a little earlier on rtl he had indicated that the singer was apparently party without tube with nothing after his operation parisian 
dr stéphane delajoux is very experienced in the middle artistic 
he had made the actress marie trintignant in vilnius a few days before his death in a clinic of neuilly on seine where he was at the time 
in two thousand seven he had also made the actress charlotte gainsbourg to reduce a hématome following a brain haemorrhage 
but it is also a doctor to the reputation sulfureuse repeatedly condemned by justice in dossiers in medical liability as well as for tax evasion and fraud 
am olivier metzner the lawyer of the order of doctors has been accused of being a man without scruples continued regularly before the council of the next and that is not advisable 
after several days of silence dr stéphane delajoux spoke friday through his lawyer david koubbi me 
this one has indicated that the speech was perfectly well and that the tests afterward were normal 
the operation was not hemorrhagic and was therefore not the laying of a drain has t it added 
in any case the tour of the singer whose troubles for health are multiplying since this summer seems incidentally 
obviously a resumption of the tour the eight january in amiens ndlr as planned it seems very short said mr camus 
the association udf tone and increase the amount the new centre not to use its acronym 
the association udf controlled by the modem françois bayrou responded friday to the takeover attempt of the president of the new centre hervé morin on the acronym of the former giscardien party putting it in remains not to use it on any support under pain of prosecution 
hervé morin has publicly announced its intention to recover the acronym udf judging that françois bayrou does not deserve to defend his legacy policy after having reached out to the left 
the defence minister , whose party is a partner of the ump had also planned to confirm this strategy on saturday before the national council of the nc 
to support its approach has received the support of the member hervé de charette ex ump happened in nc which claims ownership of the brand udf to have been the first to the table in two thousand four at the national institute of industrial property 
but on friday evening , the office of the association udf controlled by the friends of françois bayrou who do not intend to let themselves be deprived is out of his silence to launch a formal notice to the minister and member of the order of not using the acronym and convey to them the property of the brand under pain of prosecution 
you have multiplied in recent days the statements indicating that you were going to offer your political movement to resume the acronym udf writing the association in a letter signed by ten nine of the twenty four members of the office that françois bayrou and marielle de sarnez the modem as senator jean arthuis the centrist alliance 
you also believed to follow up on your militant material and on page of care of your website the name of this movement the new centre of the slogan the udf today also see the signatories of the letter 
as you know you have no right to the use of this symbol explains the office of the udf that remains the nc to immediately withdraw the mention of the name of the udf of all medium and its website 
it also asks hervé de charette to convey the property of the brand to its rightful copyright holders 
if you were not the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of adherents of the udf prevent the signatories 
in their letter they stipulate that the udf is a fully-fledged political movement for a thousand nine hundred seventy eight and recalling that mr morin and his friends had made the choice to leave in two thousand seven to create a movement competitor as others had done in two thousand two to create the ump 
the new centre has therefore no right to use the acronym udf union for french democracy 
they also recall that the last congress of the udf voted in two thousand seven its accession to the modem for three years and the creation of an office responsible for defending the material and moral interests of training founded by valéry giscard d 'estaing 
as for hervé de charette continues the bureau when he has tabled the brand it was no longer adhering to the udf for three years but the ump 
it benefits scandalously and fraudulently the abscence depositing the acronym for the udf carry out to his account 
this inappropriate is turning into a crime expose they mock before on the strategy of the nc it seems to us that in politics , as in life , it is more worthy to make a name for itself even to try to get out of the anonymity by taking fraudulently a name which has not right 
case liliane bettencourt françois marie banier will be judged for abuse of weakness 
the court in nanterre decided friday to judge the artist françois marie banier in order to determine whether as in accuses the daughter of the billionaire liliane bettencourt he has taken advantage of a state of weakness of the 80-year-old for the plunder of part of his fortune 
the photographer sixty two years known for his photographs of stars will be judged the 15 and 16 april two thousand ten for abuse of weakness a criminal offence to a maximum penalty of three years in prison and three hundred and sixty fifteen thousand euros fine 
this decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families of france in which mother and daughter are squabbling with each other while taking the reins of the empire of cosmetics the oréal 
but the fifteenth alleged bedroom has also ordered that a medical expertise of liliane bettencourt aged four twenty seven years should be conducted collectively by three doctors 
heir and main shareholder of the oréal has always refused to submit to such scrutiny at least not in the terms offered by the public prosecutor of nanterre during the investigation 
doctors appointed on friday will issue a report before the ten march two thousand ten saying especially if liliane bettencourt was able to find in a state of weakness and what periods 
i think it will submit 
i am going to speak said at the exit of the hearing , the lawyer of mrs bettencourt am georges kiejman 
for its part the lawyer of françoise bettencourt meyers am olivier metzner has welcomed the decision of the court 
it is an excellent new expertise will demonstrate that it mr banier has manipulated this elderly lady that we must protect has t it said 
for two years the single girl liliane bettencourt has engaged in criminal proceedings against françois marie banier photographer and artist is that it accuses of having benefited for years from the weakness of his mother to obtain a billion euros of donations in the form of cheques insurance contracts life or paintings of masters 
for its part liliane bettencourt has always refuted have been manipulated by the photographer that it sees as a longstanding friend 
while the court should examine the admissibility of the action taken by mrs bettencourt meyers the pleadings lawyers have sometimes turned to large family display friday 
the lawyer of liliane bettencourt reported three letters sent by his client in a thousand nine hundred four twenty ten nine two thousand three and two thousand five to his notary in which she said beware the husband of françoise bettencourt meyers 
in the letter dated two thousand three liliane bettencourt added , according to the lawyer , could you explain to my daughter that i wrote to banier once twice a day for 15 years 
françoise i have never been able to speak to him since his marriage 
for its part the nanterre prosecutor has again estimated that the complainant was not admissible to act as a judge of the supervisory authorities refused these last few days with its request to open a process of judicial protection for his mother 
liliane bettencourt has full capacity to act in justice it is not under protection and has no tutor 
nobody else has to act in his place said the representative of the public prosecutor mary chrsitine daubigney 
the tribunal has finally decided that it is consulted once the trial will take place on the admissibility of mrs bettencourt meyers 
managerial revolution or end of the economic intelligence 
if nothing changes in the governance of big french companies our fight for the development of the economic intelligence will have been in vain etc . 
for more than a decade the attitude of the management of large companies toward its employees recalls the position of the companies toward consumers before the revolution marketing it is to join the staff to values determined to high as it was used to impose the consumer products invented by the technicians from the factory 
by putting the customer at the heart of the company the revolution marketing has called the strategies of conquest of markets to the place although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected factors of preferences of back regularly clienteles 
a demobilisation of employees can lead to a deadly demoralization 
suicides at france telecom psa and renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon which particularly affects executives 
this demobilization seriously undermining the development of all intellectual functions of the company including the r&d and more economic sense 
indeed the ie requires all the stakeholders etc a pro-active and a forward-looking vision it requires the part of employees a commitment that the revenue management entirely vexatious authoritarian 
that is why we are calling for a revolution managerial skills to set the staff at the centre of the company in the same way that the customer 
the usefulness of any internal surveys 
internal polls as the questionnaire submitted by orange to its employees will they encourage this revolution in the practices managériales 
unfortunately i fear not 
firstly because i saw that in a new situation any structure in finally gets after detours to do primarily etc what it has always done 
then because authoritarianism a pathology of power grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures 
finally , because most of the leaders have a simplistic of human behaviour 
from the great engineering schools they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology 
they adopt by intellectual comfort the old theory behavioriste cranked up recently by neuroscience uniennes states and widely publicised , unbeknownst to them by the institutes of studies and the media 
and by suggesting that it is possible to use the levers sic the commitment of a recent survey of ipsos appeared in the figarofr reinforces t it managers in a posture of mechanistic governance unsuited to the world today 
identify and measure the factors of mobilisation 
instead the revolution managerial skills necessary to the proper functioning of the modern companies means to adopt a final vision of human behavior 
it is to incorporate in any reasoning or practice of governance a fundamental observation for employees the commitment for the company is only possible if this one is clear as a means of achieving a part of their dreams of their ambitions of their projects 
currently only the studies from the analysis motifonctionnelle adopt this design of the motives of the employees 
these studies have shown that they consider their company based on a predetermined ideology that allows them through their perceived image of the company to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life plans 
thanks to the identification and to the extent these factors of mobilisation business leaders can control predict and anticipate their social performance and put their management of human resources at the place 
they create a breeding ground for development of a concerted economic intelligence robust and effective

the american right has welcomed friday the speech the eve in oslo by barack obama satisfied that the nobel peace prize two thousand nine has defended the concept of a just war against the enemies of the united states 
the conservatives who had brocardé awarding the prize to mr obama the nine october applauded this time the speech like sarah palin former candidate for the vice presidency in elections two thousand eight 
i liked what he said said mrs palin heroine of the right wing of the republican party in the usa today newspaper adding have it even addressed the issue of the war sometimes necessary in his memoirs that have just been published

we must stop these terrorists all there has t it estimated 
mr obama , who has inherited the two wars of his predecessor george w bush in iraq and afghanistan has tried thursday to oslo to justify the use of force a way to explain his decision to send thirty thousand additional troops in afghanistan nine days earlier 
another opponent of mr obama newt gingrich has estimated that the president had done a great job in oslo 
i found that the speech was really very much welcomed the former chairman of the house of representatives , which has particularly appreciated the mention of the existence of evil in the world in the presidential words 
by some side i found this speech to historical fact said mr gingrich questioned during the radio programme the takeaway 
the former elected regarded by some as a possible candidate for the republican nomination for the presidential election two thousand twelve has said it is pleased to have seen a president of the left remind members of the nobel committee that they would not be free and could not put a price of peace if the use of force was no 
for michael gerson old pen of george w bush handed over to the washington post columnist , mr obama gave a speech very american 
in addition to present itself as a citizen of the world as he always does he spoke as an american president reminding the europeans that they live in a bubble of security that they have not created , and they do not do much to preserve has estimated mr gerson 
among the few right not to be convinced a falcon to the bush era , the former ambassador to the united nations john bolton described the speech of dull spouted and without inspiration on the site national review online 
has the left of the president the representative democrat dennis kucinich has alarmed to see barack obama justify the use of force 
when we wraps the war in the notion of justice we can easily justify the killing of innocent people has t it warned 
the press centre left glowing , however , remained in the place of president 
the los angeles times while continuing to think that the nobel was awarded prematurely to mr obama described his speech superproduction even for a speaker known for its talent 
the speech of oslo should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflicts poverty and oppression has reignited the daily californian 
mr obama gave the speech that he had felt the new york times the judging both dark and inspiring

the turkish courts dissolved the kurdish pro party decision with serious consequences 
the turkish constitutional court said friday the dissolution of the main kurdish pro party of the country , a decision which was immediately followed by demonstrations of anger in the kurdish community in the south east of the country and istanbul . 
this decision could greatly complicate the task of the government , which has just reach out to the kurdish community to try to put an end to twenty five years of conflict 
the democratic society party dtp has been dissolved because it had become a hotbed of activities prejudicial to the independence of the state and to its unity indivisible said in the press , president of the court hasim kiliç at the end of four days of deliberations 
the decision has been taken unanimously of eleven judges while a qualified majority of seven was required to give the dissolution indicated mr kiliç adding that thirty seven senior party including its president ahmet türk and the member aysel tugluk are banned from politics for five years 
the judge also announced the closure of the parliamentary immunity had enjoyed türk mr and mrs tugluk by the treasury and the confiscation of assets in the party 
the dtp has 21 seats in parliament on five hundred fifty 
its leaders had warned before the verdict that members leave parliament rather than sit as members without label 
the decision follows a procedure launched in two thousand seven by the prosecutor of the court of cassation abdurrahman yalçinkaya who accuse the dtp to obey the directives of the kurdistan workers party pkk regarded as a terrorist organisation by ankara and many countries 
many observers believe that the dtp is the political wing of the pkk rebels legal 
the party holds , however , that it has no organic links with the pkk but refuses to call this one terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with him 
the court 's verdict comes at a time when the government has to reach out to the kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights to try to stem the support of the kurds to the pkk and put an end to the conflict 
the leaders of the dtp had said that a dissolution could lead to an escalation of tension in the south is anatolian where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the pkk leader abdullah öcalan degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks 
when the news of justice a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the dtp to diyarbakir , the main city in the south is populated by majority kurds 
the police fired tear-gas grenades and used water cannon while protesters throwing molotov cocktails or stones with insurrections 
a hundred people protested also in istanbul 
after the verdict mr türk said that the decision of the justice system would deepen despair 
turkey cannot solve the kurdish issue ndlr by banning a party has t he said to the press 
the government formed by a party from the islamist movement has also deplored the decision 
we are opposed in principle to the closure of parties 
this does not solve said minister of energy taner yildiz 
this decision is a total torpedoing the democratic opening launched by the government has commented on the political analyst ahmet insel 
of course , we can expect a reaction from the pkk has t it added 
on thursday the pkk has claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of turkey one of the deadliest of these last few months 
the first snow can fall 
what would wolfgang brauburger it is a winter of rigorous 
but the head of the service of spadework and sablage roads fes specifies that this is not to annoy the citizens 
it is simply that the agents can test the technique of vehicles and learn the master 
and after the métérologues this could well be for this weekend 
more than 300 agents and one hundred and twenty vehicles is ready to tackle the snow and ice 
the fes follows a very elaborate plan 
mr brauburger explains that as soon as it starts to neiger on the city of frankfurt and that temperatures fall below zérode large vehicles of sablage travel twenty main routes used so-called routes has 
this includes the streets to great movement the main arteries as the neue weg and hanauer landstraße 
firefighters are also included the access routes to transport the walkability and streets in slope like the atzelbergstraße 
the agents of fes start their service to three hours of the morning 
in the case of the thousand need 40 kilometres of road owner must be salt with a road basis which adheres well in three hours maximum 
that is why the service of fes begins at three o 'clock in the morning so that the roads to be released when starts the trafficking of daily migrations 
where it becomes more difficult is when the snow starts to fall to seven hours 30 in the morning 
this causes problems we said the head of the service of spadework and sablage roads because no driver is prepared to miss the vehicles of salting 
then it does more snow we access routes and roads of servicing as the rat beil straße 
the sidings and streets latérales come to last 
mr brauburger knows that it is always a few complaints 
has five hours of the morning the team 's pedestrian fes gets in the way to reach in priority areas deemed dangerous and the passages 
as for the cycle paths the services of fes usually do not address 
mr brauburger specify that there is a special service in frankfurt is responsible to monitor the state bridges between twenty two hours and four hours thirty 
as the ice to form very quickly on these surfaces vehicles involved salting as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees 
it also happens that the police to appeal to this special service snack of need 
the cradle of dinosaurs 
the tawa hallae looked like the other carnivorous dinosaurs this upright was about two feet long for a comma fifty meters its members after his skull were powerful lying was provided teeth acérées recourbées his short arms and third countries were coming to an end by claws in sickle and he had a long tail 
if this species had lived a few million years later it would not have been exceptional 
but as reports sertling nesbitt of the university of texas in austin and his colleagues in the journal science on thursday the tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs containing the morpho-functional characteristics 
this animal lived there are two hundred and fifteen million years ago in new mexico who faisaità the time part land masses of supercontinent the pangea and was to ecuador 
sertling nesbitt said that the discovery of tawa sheds a new light the evolution of the first dinosaurs 
indeed it tells us the kinship ties the distribution and characteristics of recent 
it is in two thousand six that sertling nesbitt has undertaken searches in the company of others on the site of these paleontologists gohst ranch in northern new mexico 
randall irmis of the natural history museum in utah and a member of the team searches tells it happens sometimes find a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a layer sédimentaire dating from the trias 
scientists have very soon realised that a portion of these bones belonged to a new species 
the surveys have updated the remains of five specimens 
a discovery that confirms the theories about the beginnings of dinosaur evolution 
researchers have dubbed it the name of tawa after the word of the indians hopi people for the sun god 
for sterling nesbitt it is a quite exceptional discovery fossils of dinosaurs from the trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of bone incomplete 
all the experts in paleontology do not share this enthusiasm 
for example , martin sander of the university of bonn does not find that this discovery is particularly spectacular it says , however , that it enables us to confirm some theories about the beginnings of dinosaur evolution 
according to the current state of knowledge the dinosaurs have emerged on earth about two hundred and thirty million years 
most fossil of the older , however , are fragmented and incomplete which makes it very difficult the classification of all first dinosaurs 
the experts are wondering , among other things , to what time the sauriens were divided into three groups of major developments the théropodes carnivoresqui include the t. rex and the velociraptor emerged later and whose down the birds the sauropodes quadrupedal animals on the long neck and those who are related and the herbivores ornithischiens including the species such as the triceratops and stégosaure 
according to the studies of s nesbitt and his colleagues the tawa is one of the first théropodes 
this species to present a report interesting features both primitive and developed s nesbitt said 
researchers have found signs that suggest that the tawa hallae possèdait small air bags in his bones at the level of the skull like the birds that are the descendants of théropodes 
these small pockets of air facilitate the breath of birds compared to mammals 
it seems that in the tawa hallae the vertebrae have also been partially met air 
according to randall irmis the tawa is one of the oldest théropodes with small air bags in his bones 
as the lines related the immense sauropodes owned also air bags and a backbone slight we can think that their ancestor of this innovation already had beneficial 
three successive waves of migration to north america 
as the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in south america researchers have concluded that the sauriens were emerged there 
therefore the three major lineages of evolution are divided and have spread from south america to the rest of the world that is to say the whole land masses who formed the supercontinent pangea 
this seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of these paleontologists has also found the remains of two other théropodes which are not particularly related 
the three species can disembark from a common ancestor would have migrated argue researchers 
alan turner of the natural history museum in new york and co-author of the journal science studies said that there would have been at least three waves of migration to north america 
of course there are some contradictions 
martin sander paleontologist in bonn said that there is a species even more former the silesaure who lived in poland which belongs to a group related to dinosaurs 
according to him it may give a mistaken view because there is in south america a large number of fossils of dinosaurs that have been preserved so that there is virtually no on other continents 
by contrast how dinosaurs are they managed to become the dominant tétrapodes of the secondary era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line the branch of reptiles remains today a mystery 
at the time of the dinosaurs trias shared their habitat with many other reptiles such as with ancestors of present-day crocodiles and with many other sauriens 
towards the end of the trias dinosaurs are spread over the entire planet , thereby promoting the development of many new species while others were related have disappeared between the trias and the jurassic 
such a success , however , is not eternal 
to explain this transformation martin sander sees two hypotheses 
there may have been a mass extinction to which the dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles had disappeared 
or so the dinosaurs were better suited and they have therefore been able to eliminate the competition on the ground 
in any case such a success is not eternal 
one hundred and fifty million years later the fall of a meteorite favorisal' development of a group of animals that had also developed during the trias and since that time essentially in the shadows it was mammals 
the solidarity of vienna in sao paulo 
the list is long and there are signatories of the world

the evacuation by the police of the casino jw goethe university in frankfurt made waves on the entire planet 
two hundred and seventy eight professors and teachers of the university jw goethe but also other institutions of higher education in germany of europe and north and south america , express their solidarity with the protesting students from campus westend 
in a statement drafted in german and english they condemn the intervention of the police requested by the steering committee of the university 
last week , the president of the university werner müller estler did evacuate buildings occupied by students and teachers in grèveaprès that walls and works of art have been daubed with graffiti 
five students were injured during the evacuation 
the signatories believe the damage did not justify a violent also intervention from the commando police against students and teachers who had held their own course 
the evacuation represents an unacceptable breach to freedom of research and education 
the fact of focus exclusively on the acts of vandalism serves only to delegitimize and criminalize the protest and is trying to forget the reasons for the mobilisation 
the steering committee of the university is taken out of the debates that would be needed 
lecturers are demanding that the criminal prosecution to be suspended immediately 
the majority of the occupiers has not taken part in the degradation 
legitimacy of protests 
young people from the trade union verdi of the services sector and the confederation of german unions dgb should show solidarity students 
the protests are the legitimate expression of a growing concern for our own future said alexander klein regional secretary of young people from the trade union verdi 
as to the minister of science of the land of eva hesse kühne hörmann cdu she has campaigned for the action taken by the president of the university and the police 
we are grateful to the president of the university 
any occupation and degradation of places is totally unacceptable has t she says the regional parliament wiesbaden last thursday at the television programme aktuelle stunde 
we understand the sense of protests but do not accept the vandalism has expressed the cdu member of the regional parliament peter beuth 
the groups of the opposition spd the greens and the left the left did not share this view 
the csu takes the pretext of a few walls peinturlurés to criminalise the protests said janine wissler the party of the left left 
instead of thinking about arguments and demands of students they evacuates 
the party of the left has tabled a motion which , after the minister of the interior to submit a report on the conditions of the intervention of the police

zelenograd literal translation green city takes its name wooded hills in the heart which research centres are implanted 
the project s twenty-one a brake for stuttgart 
we cannot put high enough the scale of the project stuttgart twenty-one 
for its supporters , it is nothing less than new heart of europe 
if you want to s twenty and one that is much more than the burial of a railway station more than a massive construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of bade wurtemberg in a despairing chaos of yards for a dozen years 
stuttgart twenty and one is born of the spirit of the years four vingts 
the stations front line with approaches that third countries were coming to an end in full city had a reputation at the time to be the relics of the technique of transport of ten ninth century that were effect of sabot brake modern rail traffic because it was once a lot of time to get the engine of the back to the front 
arrival ruling short beginning it is this that we should do 
that is why the stations front line must disappear in frankfurt and munich 
and stuttgart as a station of passing trains that is half way around on the rail trans-european between paris and budapest bratislava where the slogan heart of europe 
the project s twenty-one will really start although the visions years four vingts are no longer compatible to the reality 
even the most ambitious planners have acknowledged that the cost to bury the station in the respective capitals of hesse and bavaria was exorbitant 
indeed the stations front line are really more problems for the entry and exit since there are modern trains reversible with autorails and pilot car at both ends 
however it is now launching the achievement of stuttgart twenty-one next to the new route of the inter city line towards ulm 
the policies regional and municipal prevailed 
the company of the railways is in part because it is the taxpayer who made the costs of the risks of biggest infrastructure project of the federal republic and not the public 
from the point of view town-planning this project is relatively well justify 
you get a urban space , which according to the graphs planners generated by a computer will be very lush , green 
for the system of rail transport the s twenty-one is harmful 
the station of passage and the enlargement of the section are designed for a traffic people which allowed and it is typical of years four vingts an enormous growth 
then there is still not competition cheap flights 
the policy of the modern traffic should first focus on strengthening freight traffic because transport by rail is much more environmentally friendly as by truck on the road 
but the new route with its inclinaisons is not appropriate to freight trains 
the s twenty-one and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects 
for example six billion euros will be swallowed up in the draft of the swabian 
this is the official figure 
experts believe that 10 to 15 billion is more realistic 
one thing is sure in the next decade the money involved for other points of interface and congestion in the network 
the list of the ministry of transport mentions in any sixty large projects 
one of the most important is the enlargement of the section through the rhine valley 100 four vingts good kilometres 
for a thousand nine hundred twenty four seven this line is built in slow motion 
it would be really urgent to support here in substance on the fungus 
but the project s twenty and a fact the effect of a braking sabot 
the route of the rhine valley is becoming the bottleneck freight traffic international and this in the heart of europe 
the government is considering the judgment on the airport 
the regional parliament wiesbaden the national government has raised the possibility of appeal to the judgement of the administrative court of hesse on the ban of night air flights 
the minister of economics dieter posch fdp has announced that the coalition cdufdp had entrusted experts to examine from a legal point of view the ruling by the administrative court and which is a document containing more than four hundred pages 
the court of kassel justified in a written document that the land should adapt the regulation on the ban of night flights in the case or the construction of the track to aterrissage north west of frankfurt airport would be 
the authorisation of attérir for ten seven had between twenty three hours and five hours of the morning as envisaged in the national government is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against the night air pollution 
the coalition must have decided for the four january if she wants to do an appeals process against the ruling 
the opposition criticism this deadline and trying to put pressure on the government representative for that cirenonce the appeal of the federal administrative court leipzig 
the head of the parliamentary group spd torsten schäfer gümbel invite the cdu and the fdp to return to their promise made before the election , and was to ban night flights otherwise it will be condidéré as a total failure of a given 
it is so damned hard to be allowed to keep its word said the leader of the greens tariq al wazir alluding to the slogan of the fdp éléctoral we keep our promises 
the minister dieter posch refute accusations of schäfer gümbel which claims that the national government is trying to allow when even the night flights with avocasserie and roublardises 
it takes time to review the precise legal 
the coalition does not want to take a decision on the basis of a rapid first impression 
it must be that the decision is legally reliable said stefan müller fdp 
the interpretation of the opposition on the statements of his fraction on the ban of night flights is completely érronée 
us banks repay the aid 
the big american banks very affected by the crisis have taken away from their ties to the state 
the bank of america announced wednesday that it had repaid in full at the treasury forty five billion dollars more than 30 billion euros corresponding to aid in the framework of the rescue plan tarp 
the chain of american television cnbc indicated in a report that citigroup also envisaged repay aid received

the door floor of citigroup did not wish to comment on this information 
in june the banks goldman sachs , jp morgan chase and morgan stanley had repaid the public funds that they had received 
election accelerated 
ultimately , it is when even spent more quickly than expected 
just two weeks after the purge of the current taking the post of chief redacteur nikolaus brender by the board of the german chain zdf the successor is already appointed 
the commission wanted to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment 
peter frey , who runs the drafting berlin zdf was the odds-on favorite 
the chain , however , did not want to officially confirm the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure 
however , it seems that there was also the desire not to further undermine steward of the zdf markus schächter in case the proposal would not be accepted by the board 
frey , who is the candidate of schächter needs the votes of nine members of the committee on 14 
the outcome of the vote was not yet known to the closing of the drafting of this edition 
there are two weeks schächter had proposed to the board of five-year extension of the contract of nikolaus brender but this was rejected 
only seven members of the council were in favour of the renewal of brender and seven others had voted against the impeachment by vote of brender represented a failure although predictable for schächter 
indeed the cdu majority on the board had already suggested several weeks before the vote does not want to renew brender to his post 
it is roland koch , the minister president of land of hesse , who had organised a league against the editor 
he had refused the contract of the esteemed redacteur in chief is extended , citing the fact that the rate of listening to the emissions of information from the zdf had fallen under brender 
that is why the protests were still taking place almost until the vote lashing out at the growing political influence exerted on the zdf 
at the end there was even thirty five experts in public law who had intruded in the debate and who believed that the action of koch was unconstitutional 
but it will have achieved nothing 
peter frey is it 
peter frey is born the four august thousand nine hundred and fifty seven to bingen 
he studied political science pedagogy etles spanish romance languages 
he then worked at südwestfunk radio body rhineland palatinate and the german daily frankfurter rundschau national 
in a thousand nine hundred four twenty three it becomes editor in the zdf first in news magazine heute journal newspaper today 
then its journey continues a thousand nine hundred four twenty eight to nine hundred thousand four twenty ten he was the deputy editor of the times and then corresponding to washington in a thousand nine hundred four twenty eleven splash thousand nine hundred and twenty four twelve then until thousand nine hundred four twenty ten eight he was and the presenter morgenmagazins issuance of fortnightly information presented in the morning until two thousand a he was responsible for the service of foreign policy of the zdf then head of the berlin drafting 
after the disgrace of brender while this one had just been elected journalist of the year by the magazine specialising medium magazin the greens have announced that they laid down a constitutional complaint 
the enemy of koch on board the minister president of rhineland palatinate kurt beck said last week that the länder should transform the intergovernmental treaty of the zdf so that the proposals to staff of steward cannot be blocked by a political majority one-sided 
however beck does not intend to ask for the withdrawal of politicians members of the committees for monitoring the zdf 
peter frey the likely successor to brender had manoeuvred cleverly to the council of administration vehemently criticising the commission in its decision to sack brender 
thanks to this show of journalistic independence schächter was able to propose for the post of editor without losing face even that the board could elect without the soupconne to put in the post a political supporter 
in the representations arithmetic of parties frey is classified left-wing liberal 
cleansing in university studies 
partial success for students after a year of educational strike the ministers of education and cultural affairs länder decide to be more conciliatory in a meeting between ministers and the delegates of the conference of vice-chancellors an agreement has been developed stating that the working conditions of students bachelor or master 's degree should be improved 
has the future students should be able to overcome their studies 
they are particularly agreed to reduce the weight of the examinations a single review should allow us to close the module of study chosen 
more of the burden of work will have to be reconsidée to ensure the proportions realistic and acceptable 
the political authorities and higher education institutions want to facilitate the recognition of exams between universities and abroad 
the states are also committed to hold joint structural requirements more flexible for the smuggling of bachelor and masters 
at the regional level there must be no regulation different from one province to another 
less examinations 
since the beginning of the student protests last june the education minister länder and university rectors have repeatedly in the mouth the buzzword étudiabilité 
but for the first time this expression seems to take a practical significance 
the accreditation council has decided to greatly reduce the number of some tests every module must be reached by a single examination can we read in a document of a thirty pages on the future conditions for admission to the university cycles 
reinhold grimm president of the council of accreditation says that significantly reducing the burden of the examinations we should be able to stop the slide that hurting considerably in the étudiabilité 
the étudiabilité should also be in the future the decisive criterion of organisation of studies 
the modules as the substance must be examined carefully to see if we can avoid this feeling of stifling that it sometimes feels in the choice of course 
hamburg berlin , according to the latest knowledge kunduz raid on the opposition believes that the defence minister karl theodor zu guttenberg csu is guilty of deliberate deception 
students should have the opportunity and the leeway to allow and encourage the personal initiative 
the new regulation will apply to access to the new university rounds but will also be adapted to the existing cycles 
these cycles must be réaccrédités every five years which means , however , that it is only by two thousand 15 that all rounds have been examined 
ten agencies competent accreditation on the entire federal territory who depend on accreditation council created by the länder 
in october the education ministers had exerted some pressure on the länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes are not too loaded and the regime exams not too strict 
in some länder universities and specialist colleges have already heard with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures 
the rhineland palatinate is so far the only land to have agreed to give more money to the development of the bologna process 
with these funds universities must organise massive programmes and strengthen the offices of educational guidance as well as the offices of examinations and the service of international relations 
the länder and universities to provide a budget of ten million euros 
beginning two thousand ten the government wants to submit to parliament an amendment to the law on higher education institutions 
following this , there will be no more than a single examination to close its studies 
the organization of studies will be more flexible more , it must be able to ensure the recognition of increased notes other institutions of higher education and access to the master 's should be simplified 
by the end of next year létudiabilité of all university cycles will be examined 
last thursday the government and the opposition again have debated the question of study conditions in the country 
the decisions were appreciated but there have been some criticisms 
the federal president of the union of students socialists has indicated that he would like the organisation of the educational policy is more in the future behind the closed doors of ministers and university rectors 
at the latest after the strike educational students as people concerned should be able to speak a little 
the future diplomés of higher education we received the support of president delegates from the conference of vice-chancellors hrk margret wintermantel experience of students we is very useful has t she said thursday during a meeting with the education ministers länder with which the hrk is working on a joint project of reform 
for the trade union of education and science gew the decisions taken in bonn do not go far enough it calls for the right and the possibility for each graduate bachelor to register to a cycle of masters 
andreas keller member of the steering committee of gew request that the länder provide students bachelor today that tomorrow there will be enough places for studies in the masters and the conditions of studies as good as possible 
the länder must therefore hire more lecturers 
by contrast the education ministers have not mentioned the possibility of ease access to master 
more than a note at the bottom of page on herta müller 
it is by these words arrival in germany and it is a beautiful almost more control that begins the poet werner söllner in which he thématise in scraps phrases troubling the experiences of a dissident arrived in germany that won the freedom , but has lost at the same time its territory linguistic 
werner söllner born in thousand nine hundred fifty and one to banat in romania was first professor of german and english in bucharest and later director of collection in a publishing house for youth before settling in frankfurt 
söllner has received various literary prize in thousand nine hundred four twenty thirteen it took the much-desired professorship of poetry of goethe university in frankfurt and for two thousand two it is director of the forum of literature of hesse to the house of artist of mousonturm in frankfurt 
he has done a lot of talk about him in literary circles not last tuesday at a congress in munich where the theme was the german literature in romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your files securitate 
visibly destabilized and embarrassed söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his colleagues writers germano romanians as richard wagner william totok franz hodjak and helmuth frauendorfer that he had worked as an informant for the police policy securitate 
söllner received in nine hundred thousand four twenty nine the price of the german language , together with some of the participants 
the trials of recruitment had begun insidiously in thousand nine hundred sixty and eleven 
i am concludes söllner so someone who has not been able to resist the trials of intimidation of the securitate 
the poet werner söllner is the informant walter im walter 
almost simultaneously with the honoration nobel prize for herta müller and his literary disentangled copies with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of german authors from romania in a case which clearly shows the abyss and the heinous act of a political system based on police surveillance and spying 
werner söllner is all one can say after current knowledge not only guilty but also victim 
in his own dossier securitate im walter has played a role ensures the specialist literature michael markel after the confession of söllner and it refers to the positive influence of im walter who had intervened in its favour 
he had been able to the draw of all the difficult situations at the time of after markel 
markel felt the need to make this comment moralde 
the form in which söllner made his statement and before this audience was unexpected , however , the admission of a former dissident its cooperation with the romanian secret services is , in fact , not so surprising 
germany is a reserve enjoyable for the spies of the securitate had already written herta müller in july in the newspaper die zeit after having read the nine hundred 14 pages of his own dossier 
we can assume that the victims have made of speculation and sometimes have guessed what real names last hid the names of loans sorin voicu and also walter 
instead of germany where between time consultation of files of the stasi is a reliable process the attitude to the legacy of the files of the securitate is still very confused 
a systematic explanation has been repeatedly frustrated and slowed in the past years 
it is only by thousand nine hundred four twenty ten nine that a national council corresponding to the institution birthler has been created to work to assimilation of archives of the securitate cnsas but the return of the files has dragged on since 
there is for two thousand five a law which defines the management of archives 
that the influence of former members of the securitate in romania is still very large is confirmed by the interview with a former head of the securitate of temesvar which after the announcement of the award of the nobel prize to herta müller is extended so very dismissive of the winner 
she had a psychosis and in the end had questioned only once 
the disgrace of power was thought to be able to speak here without any gene under the guise of freedom of expression 
certainly many of the questions are inevitable associated with the case söllner as so often happens in a context of guilt hidden 
why now that has been despoiled the reaction of the listeners to the admission of söllner gives us hope that the result of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst to know that by accusations and a sense of shame 
on the genesis of the work of herta müller which has yesterday received the nobel prize is more than a note at the bottom of page 
turmoil in the champions league 
we had the impression that a representative there could best coming straight from a christmas party cool on which the manufacturer of articles of sport had spread its goods when the new coach vfb christian gross monta at a quarter to midnight in a class mercedes % had just call an orange plastic bag of supplier to the hand 
the man whose skull bald drew attention allowed himself to drive in the city that it was foreign still 
otherwise our quinquagénaire could take him even the wheel he had not drunk alcohol , and this was not drunk happiness 
he had spent a pleasant evening but tomorrow we needed to resume the work 
because it is now that it was going to start 
the words of switzerland that we had to take three days earlier were clear we have reached the final eighth of this is to say in the champions league thanks to our three two points against unirea urziceni romania but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by the success it will be a brutal struggle not to fall 
the hard work we expected sunday 
here it is again in mainz the results of the champions league daily 
and it will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three goals of hurried marica five träsch eight and pogrebnyak eleven 
lottery 
the eighth final of the champions league match go thousand six hundred and ten seven two thousand three hundred and twenty four february return match nine hundred and ten thousand six hundred and ten seven march will be learned the fate the ten eight december in nyon 
the joy of the entry of the successor to cap pistols babbel was therefore moderate 
and the joy was not only moderate among those who brought a chance which had forwarded professionals in stuttgart destabilised motivated and the pleasure of play 
i have been to see the players and i told them that they should concentrate on their strengths i have advised them to be more courageous explained the plumber of souls gross the recipe for success that sounded if bienmais who was more of an effect with the healer babbel 
it has triggered a certain magic confessed jens lehmann supporter of babbel in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that you would never have believed possible 
and sami khedira which after weeks of inflated pause to injury as the best player thanks to his dynamism tried to describe the phenomenon seen by a proverbial fresh winds and working methods of the new leader is someone who is taking action and requires discipline 
that is what we need in the current situation 
but apparently babbel had missed 
the vfb stuttgart has not yet passed the course warned the manager horst heldt 
for the moment vfb stuttgart are in need of tenacity 
just as gross players and the manager tightlipped about to overstate the victory against a defense totally overwhelmed and weakened guests romanians 
they had also won in glasgow before having had four days later a bad awakening to leverkusen with the zero two points four objecta khedira 
horst heldt signala the manager that they had well reached one of the goals of the season but they had other which were still far 
we have not yet past the difficult hurdle 
that heldt the day of his 40th anniversary does not have the heart to do the festival even after the first victory at home for three months is of the events of the weekend that a television interview the guardian of aim jens lehmann did pick up just before the start of the game 
there are decisions that other take and not jens contrecarrait heldt in response to the criticism of lehmann 
he accused the direction of weakness of style and said that it had decided to change of coach under the pressure of fans pubertaires 
lehmann had judged also as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and envy the fact that his day of free after matches has been removed him 
the statements of lehmann were marked by a pure selfishness slid heldt and announced the consequences for the guardian of aim 
they risked more become friends for life these two 40-year-olds 
in any cast they agreed to everything else that is to say that without the work of the group by the coach replaced the strong sports representation restive and would not have been possible 
babbel and his assistants have been for a large part in the success rétorquèrent heldt and lehmann in chorus and even the man in the plastic bag acquiesça

the case kunduz 
frontal attack by the opposition , the leader of the green group jürgen trittin has accused the minister of defense guttenberg of lying in the case of the case kunduz 
the spd party and the left the left are calling on the chancellor explanations 
hamburgberlin after considering the latest information on the air attack of kunduz the opposition has accused the minister of defence karl theodor zu guttenberg csu to have délibérémentdissimulé some facts 
the minister has intentionnellementformulé a fiction on the murderous hits of two lorries tanks in september said the head of the green group jürgen trittin saturday during the emission of information of the chain tagesschau ard , the journal of 20 m . 
clearly this means he has lied 
the order to kill , was given in total disregard for the rules of the international security assistance force in afghanistan , isaf 
this is in essence the content of the report available to nato and which has been read by mr guttenberg said trittin 
last friday , according to new revelations of the media the objective of lafrappe was in fact not to destroy the stolen trucks but sought to eliminate two taliban leaders important 
according to the report of the inquiry of nato one hundred and forty two people had been killed or injured in the attack american airline which was launched at the request of the german colonel goerg klein military commander of kunduz 
the greens the spd and the left have asked saturday chancellor angela merkel cdu to vote as soon as possible before the federal parliament and reveal what guttenberg really knew about the incident 
jürgen trittin and his colleague from the green party renate künast are of the opinion that angela merkel must say clearly if the strategy of targeted massacre is part of the government 's afghan policy fédéralet if the chancellery the army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy 
the door floor of the government categorically reject these criticisms 
the chancellery has in no way influenced the interventions of the military in afghanistan has t he says 
on saturday the voices were increasingly strong to express doutesquant the real reasons the referral of the inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan and the secretary of state peter wichert as it had been presented by the ministry 
according to the intelligence of the newspaper spiegel the information that they had called to guttenberg concerning the attack trucks tanks were both correct and complete 
officially they would have concealed the existence of the report of nato and hidden the minister some details troublesome 
in the vicinity of the two senior officials , it suggests , however , that they have informed the ministry of defence of the existence of several reports that a document of two pages of colonel klein as well as a report of the military police 
the frankfurter allgemeiner sonntagszeitung reported that wichert would have meanwhile demanded in a letter a clarification of the facts 
until now it has not been answered 
on saturday the ministry did not wish to comment on the allegations and referred to the committee of inquiry of the federal parliament which was going to be the next wednesday in order to provide the light on the facts in question 
the worlds of dream 
some see all awake images and hear voices that nobody else sees or hears 
it is not only among the mental ill or under the effect of the drug that the boundaries between imagination and reality mix 
as long as these phenomena occur during sleep everything is going very well 
when we are laying in our bedrooms overshadowed we can do without barriers to dreams and wildest fantasies 
however the one who awake experienced dream intends to and see things that others do not perceive quickly the reputation in our western world to be crazy or drugged or at least be an original 
such images and voices do not appear that among the mental ill or under the effect of the drugs 
this is our imagination that is in question is the same neural activity which allows us to design houses paint pictures or write novels but sometimes prompts the boundaries between the dream the madness and reality to melt 
a state of conscious awakening taking the form of a dream may present itself as the the most diverse in the best case we call this visions at worst madness 
but even if the trigger and the effect is distinguished the visions of the mystical hildegard von bingen the experiences of drugs in the prophet of the new age carlos castaneda member latter of chamanes psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to the process very similar 
there are hallucinations or delusions when the balance of substances neurotransmettrices of the brain first dopamine noradrenalin serotonin and achétylcholine breaks down and that the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted 
hallucinations complex and wild thoughts are very often during a psychosis schizophrenic 
the force of earth 's attraction has more power on the person 
since antiquity philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between the madness and the dream 
for aristotle hallucinations were a form of daydream wilhelm griesinger one of the founders of modern psychiatry found in thousand eight hundred sixty and a great resemblance between the madness and the dream for sigmund freud the dream was even a psychosis with all irregularities imaginations delusions and sensory illusions that the composed 
we are in the autumn two thousand a when henning t turns into a comic strip character 
his body is in two dimensions to the colors criardes 
the land attraction has more power on him he hangs from the ceiling in the tidal 
he feels a sudden 
behind him creatures of devil winged grimaçantes the mouth bloodstained showing teeth 
they continue to give it a few feet with heavy boots flamboyantes the cast against the walls he feels the pain throughout the body 
the voice thundering roar evil outgoing walls and radio 
it can no longer bear these voices who insult and humiliate him 
henning t severs two cables of its chain stereo in fact a loop and attaches it to a hook set the ceiling 
it gets on a baffle and happens the loop around the neck 
it jumps 
the loop stands out 
that is a lesson to you mouthing the voice in a chorus to extract the eardrum goes in a clinic and do you treat 
today henning t has 40 years he lived six acute psychoses the last two years , the first of 20 years soon 
it has been triggered by lsd 
the diagnosis schizo affective paranoid psychosis in addition it is maniaco depressive it takes medication for depression the mania schizophrenia 
he has learned to live with his illness it is married for three years 
during the psychosis i lived fears terrible and despondency profound 
illusions are a cruel reality 
one percent of the population is suffering at least once in their lives of schizophrenia in the psychiatric clinic is the most common illness after the depression 
in a crisis of schizophrenia people can no longer make the difference between the inside and the outside world , they are in a state of hyper arousal , which means that they can suffer from hallucinations megalomania of madness or persecution relational 
it is very common to hear the voice of the voice that dictate who elicited comments or chat 
the optical hallucinations are not uncommon either 
the person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the trivial the brain can no longer filter the disruptive signals the aware is drowned under the sensations 
just as the dream the hype opens the floodgates to a tide of ideas and fantasies outcome of deeper layers of consciousness 
the perception of reality in the hype is centered on the subject , according to professor thomas fuchs head of the department of psychiatry of chu of heidelberg allgemeine psychiatry im universitätsklinikum 
the schizophrenic is in the centre of the situation all meaning focused on him 
at the same time it is reflected in a passive role it is as in a dream overcome by events and may not act on them in an active 
that is why the schizophrenic often feel threatened controlled manipulated 
in general they do not have the opportunity to adjust the reality illusions are a harsh reality wake up is excluded 
to experience a time in his life of a hallucination 
unlike the dream according to fuchs the sensory structure space and the reality that is seen during the psychosis is fundamentally retained 
the thoughts and hallucinations wild are based on the fact the alienation of the experienced takes place in a real framework 
why our brain does it this kind of antics is still a mystery to researchers 
exceptional situations can bring everyone to momentarily lose the perception of reality according to fuchs 
but only a small number of people develop a psychosis 
there seems to have a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia but studies of twins have shown that the genes are not the only factors 
researchers assume that the people involved are tiny brain damage 
we assume that the neural maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development , for example , by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy explains fuchs 
but what remains unexplained that is the way the anomaly of the neural system happens and also the fact that it is not for many years 
environmental factors also play a role stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis if , however , there is predisposition 
of even the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they operate on the neurotransmitters 
when our brain heating 
this is crazy we said professor of psychology erich kasten of lübeck is that the suffering psychotic their hallucinations and take medicines expensive for getting rid of it while others buy drugs very expensive for obtaining them 
the perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a matter of perspective 
kasten brings together for ten years of reports on hallucinations and phenomena illusory images last year he published his results in a book called the world unreal in our head 
the hallucinations do well among the concomitant phenomena typical psychoses but also an impressive number of many other pathologies 
there are among they psychological problems such as borderline or depression but also the migraine epilepsy multiple sclerosis , alzheimer 's disease or head injury 
it is surprising that in certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations 
the hallucinations according to kasten consists of fragments of memories that are normally inhibés 
they take form when the areas of the brain sensory perceptions are overactive or not enough refrénées when our brain 's warm but also when there is lack of stimulation 
drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or a psychosis 
but the lack of stimulus stress the sorrows of love or other mental states exceptional 
in studies a third of participants acknowledges having done at least once in his life experience a hallucination 
in summer two thousand five sarah k has 16 years she lives a small town of pomeranian mecklenburg earlier and it goes to the high school 
a young girl to do everything to true say normal 
if there had not the images and voices 
during the recess happens that a young boy thin the long hair châtain offer him the floor 
when she meets his comrades watch surprised nobody else sees or hears this boy 
they believe that this young girl timid is a lunatic dreamer but sarah k not dream she is certain 
it is awake and wants to see this boy as she sees and hears the girl who is sitting next to it on the bench 
it can even see its presence momentarily 
it is a pleasant sensation she finds this young sympathetic 
am i crazy wonders t it sometimes 
but she knows that this young and other visions are not real and that they are going to disappear again 
the night the outbreaks are generally frightening 
often the visions are cumbersome 
when it is in class happens that it cannot follow the course , because the professor is right presenting a new pupil in her eyes and her ears when it is invisible to others and that the teacher is visibly explaining the picture equations 
the night the outbreaks are generally frightening 
when in the darkness of his bedroom it expects the sleep which happens all too rarely and far too late , it often cannot distinguish if it is awake or dream already if the images that she sees the faces grimaçants or the girl with sanguinolentes cuts on the arms and legs are in front of their eyes open or closed 
let me alone screams t it to these creatures 
it does not speak and his parents and his friends they would for a mad 
autumn two thousand nine sarah k now has 20 years 
it has had its masters last year and she lives with her friend 
it was a year ago hallucinations have stopped 
since she came in contact by the internet with the psychologist kasten she knows very well that it is not crazy 
the madness is also a work of art of despair 
when someone is socially isolated or has not enough incentives the likelihood is that he has hallucinations after a certain time 
i assume that the brain is not quite busy means that there are animation 
sarah k single girl was afraid of other children when she was small and playing often alone 
the hallucinations began when she learned to 13 years that the man she called daddy since she was in age of thinking was not his real father 
these are the same brain regions that are active for the visual hallucinations and acoustic and for the impressions and real sounds so it is very difficult for people like sarah k to tell the difference between the illusion and reality every experience according to kasten took place in the brain , the reality is formed from there 
hallucinations are also images that form in the brain that is why they seem so real 
for kasten night dreams are also a form of hallucination 
the hallucinations of healthy people differ not fundamentally those acute psychoses 
unlike the schizophrenic mentally healthy person is able to recognise that the fantasies are not actual pictures 
that is why kasten advises her patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent 
there is only a step between the dream and the hallucination 
in our world too focused on the conscience has unfortunately been quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for pathology according to michael schmidt degenhard professor in heidelberg and doctor head of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy of the hospital florence nightingale in düsseldorf 
a psychosis is a serious disease painful but which also contains something positive creator madness is a work of art of despair 
schmidt degenhard has studied the form of so-called experience oniroïde a particular form of the change of consciousness awake by the dream 
the experienced oniroïdes semi- dreams are very complex which are perceived as real by anyone who lives and that he cannot differentiate the dream even when it is in a state of awakening 
the state of consciousness oniroïde manifests itself for a trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathie which fully aware do experience a paralysis engine 
according to schmidt degenhard when a human being is threatened by a loss of itself and the world due to a complete inability and sustainable move it replaces the real situation which undermines his life by his own fantasy world which is divorced from the reality 
it is a state of mental limit between the dream and the hallucination 
as it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality a change in the world has to take place , but the real situation is represented in the imagination 
it is actually a form intense resources and interpretation in a situation in itself intolerable organisational capacity which is given to us men not to sink into the nothingness of the loss of consciousness 
everything is real even later in the memories 
the zurichois peter cornelius classen art historian also describes his experiences oniroïdes in his book change of heart as action to safeguard the soul 
he has 40 nine years at a time when its aware hand for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed a transplant during this time , his body is condemned to stay immobile in resuscitation 
claussen plunges in a world that it has created all coins visit places foreigners trip in the time it sees in old man bed in a rail sanatorium a robot to his bedside on her health care 
he lives in the middle ages among the noble that manufacture drugs derived from blood 
it is kidnapped by a greek motorbikes which takes him in his country it surf with his hospital bed in the névé of the alps and meeting a korean mafia 
it absorbs completely in this fantasy world everything is real even later in his memories 
according to claussen these domestic travel differ fundamentally from any dream 
the dream is a state quite different writing it in describing what he has experienced 
on the contrary dreams the memories from the mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later 
we can even say that they are much more distinctive and more intensive the experience real 
the intensity of this had been splintered the horizon of our other everyday experiences according to the psychiatrist schmidt degenhard 
ultimately the mania oniroïdes psychoses hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how much our internal representations of external reality are fragile even in a state of eve 
any change of consciousness summarises the psychologist kasten can cause a distortion of what we call reality 
an experience that can also be quite enriching

burda 
twenty seven years children will take the continuation of the publishing house 
the appointment of kallen as ceo of editions burda is an intermediate solution in the long term hubert burda hope that his two children take up the group of press has t he said to the newspaper spiegel

and for the first time this is not a family member who is the head of editions burda 
the children of burda respectively have ten nine and ten seven years his son felix , which would have today forty two years died a few years ago

the ruins have always happened in the families who have left lead by a capital bulimia which have made enormous speculation unfortunate in thinking that they could climb ever higher 
this has never been my strategy 
i have never had rêvede universal power said burda 
i am absolutely not in the role of a tutor as could be springer and i do not intend to be part of these international leagues as the time these companies have taken too much importance

mazda three i stop a sustainable sporting spirit 
mazda intends to prove that the sporting spirit is not angry with respect for the environment 
to this end she has to include on the mazda three the system of judgment and engine start called i stop a device that at least for the moment is available only on the engine 20 in essence of one hundred and fifty horses 
this second generation of mazda three be illustrated by the note that it has achieved in his whole 
the details the finishing of the vehicle board the behaviour mechanics the system i stop etc . 
all these aspects are remarkable on the new mazda three 
starting with the post of conduct it turns out that the seats are fronts ergonomics and a setting excellent 
the touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant 
by continuing with the whole formed by the picture of control and the console , we see how mazda has continued in the japanese tendency to create a design of interior futuristic with many buttons and orders as well as colorful in red and blue 
this style reminds us , in part , the honda civic 
that is why we can say that both the mazda three that the civic all two japanese contrast with the sobriety of german products and especially with the volkswagen golf that all want to outshine 
continuing with this car compact systems japanese presents a habitability more than enough to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort 
add to this a great trunk to regular forms 
the system of judgment and automatic start-up of the engine at least for the moment is available only on the petrol engine of two litres and one hundred fifty horses and with change manuel of the six speeds 
this engine is a true happiness it illustrates by its finesse its low noise its benefits and the mastery of its consumption 
indeed although the mazda three most requested the diesel models are those who do not carry out a large number of miles per year should not exclude this i stop with petrol engine for both his great comfort of speed that for its consumption controlled 
on the level of equipment the model chosen for the test is the sport in other words that which has the largest number of elements of series 
among the equipment of series the assistant of a change of direction rvm which removes the angle death controls traction and stability the regulator to speed the mirror photosensitive internal the on-board computer on a screen of great size parking sensors air-conditioning independent the sensor of rain and light the bluetooth and the bluetooth audio as well as the wheels of alignment of ten seven inches are particularly remarkable 
more as if this equipment was not enough this version had the pack schedules which for thousand five hundred euros more includes , among other elements of the adaptive headlights bí xenon and audio system with record charger bose 
conclusion 
the mazda three hundred and twenty i stop is one of the best cars of its class tight 
it illustrates in particular by the quality of the materials used by his behavior and by its level of equipment high 
most of those who are not doing a lot of miles per year will be able to choose the version i stop associated with only the gasoline engine , 20 of one hundred and fifty horses 
the only drawback of this model is its high price that lies between 20 and a thousand seven hundred and sixty ten euros for finishing luxury and twenty three thousand two hundred and sixty ten euros for the model tested the sports 
in return for this important sum the mazda three will give us every day a large dose of satisfaction 
first of luxury

the promise of fonpeek 
peek is extremely limited , it is a mechanism which allows only to look at his e-mail without offering the possibility would be that to see certain type of enclosures or surf the internet 
he tabled its five minutes of fame in the united states when the magazine the act as one of the products of the year 
in truth it is more difficult to see in the streets , but the idea seems interesting especially for the young 
unlike the phones peek offers a price and a very low monthly subscription is less than half of what it costs , for example , the subscription data of the iphone 
given his success , the company has launched two new devices one designed exclusively for twitter , the other with a free service of data to life for six times more expensive than the peek 
fonpeek presented yesterday at the event , the web is the european version of invention and its third incarnation 
it is also limited than its american big brother but includes a surprise 
the price of its monthly subscription approximately 12 euros includes the roaming across europe 
those who travel with a smart phone already know what represents the fact of abandoning the data when you cross a border or desperately seeking a cafeteria on wi-fi or a connection of fon to check his mail 
the idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it is a long time that it should function 
indeed some operators have special arrangements and options trip but as far as i am concerned i would need to have made a theory in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small print 
the repeated reminders to the european commission to propose roaming fees affordable in the whole of europe have had a barely perceptible 
outside their country of origin people hesitate to use the data and it does not wrong 
a small device as the fonpeek it is always curious that it is called fon so that it does not have wifi offers this type of tariffs means that operators are starting to think differently and to study various proposals allowing them to make their data network 
the kindle is another good example he understands the downloading of books and other research on the internet 
without subscription and without boat 
it is a device connected and you pay during its purchase and not every month 
and that is what i hope to see a day for the fonpeek an option to purchase with access to life as peek proposes already in the united states 
not that i want to buy it 
i look at my mail on my phone , thank you . 
i would simply because i believe that this is a more fair formula for the consumer 
it would be interesting to see a computer with the same system 
the favorite color of michelle 
the yellow is probably the favorite color of the first lady of the united states 
if it went to the inauguration of barack obama to the presidency of the united states with a dress and a mantle of this color she has chosen the same for the match in the second time without doubt the most important of his life the award in oslo the nobel peace prize 
michelle obama wore a model very similar in these two occasions in addition to their color ressemblante a yellow drawing towards the green with reflections brilliant twice the holding consisted of three coins the dress the jacket and the coat in the same tissues and was adorned with a large embroidery or a collier 
so a first glance it would appear that the first lady of the united states follows the wake of the princess of asturias and has chosen to get the same held 
but the fabric in which are carved up the two blocs makes them very different 
if the assumption of office , it was a delicate manoeuvring thick but it was a printed in oslo velvet 
accessories are also different shoes green to heel way for the first opportunity and a similar model but this time , golden

sixty 15 % of working mothers have had problems professionals because of their maternity 
discrimination at work has increased in recent years , especially for women of young people who want to be mothers 
it is this that reveals the study fertility and career women in spain carried out by the csic in collaboration with the instituto the mujer 
the investigation on nine thousand seven hundred and thirty seven women of 15 to 60 fifteen years leaves no room for doubt sixty 15 % of working mothers have seen their career limited because of motherhood 
the study indicates that there are many differences on the beginning of life as a couple , and the number of children if the woman is working or not , and the type of employment occupied 
those who have not of activity outside the home part-time work or have a little work stable are earlier as couples have their first pregnancy sooner and have more children 
but women who have a stable job mainly in the public sector grow back the entry in life as a couple , and the first pregnancy and have fewer children 
the five women between 30 and 40 nine years with a fixed work have their first child , on average , three comma seven years after being installed as couples this figure happening to four comma a among those who work in the public sector these data shows that women who have a stable job had need more time in their lives for what has led to the postponement of the union and the arrival of children 
more the kinds of jobs exercised influence largely motherhood but less the date of early life explains the common researcher of csic margarita delgado 
the level of studies is another factor that widening the gap of the age of marriage of women and their first child 
according to the survey more the level of training is high , the more they marry and have their first child later 
the difference is also maintains among women of the same generation 
for example , in the group with five between 30 and 40 nine years those that have done studies basic and higher respectively have been mothers for the first time in five comma a twenty and thirty two years on average a comma 
another disctinction also appears between women depending on their level of studies 
while those who have done the basic studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job those having done studies of average level or above reverse this programme and give priority to obtaining a stable work as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child states mrs delgado

a cowardly attack 
last week my mother who has approximately 60 ten years was walking in our neighborhood of the city of fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 10 eight years spent by her side and our dog blood mélé saved the aps and weighing no more than six pounds and without saying a word they assenèrent two strokes of feet which left the dog seriously injured 
our outrage is huge because we do not see this as there are fun to attack free of charge a small animal without defence which was leaves 
add to this the indignation of a woman who was walking calmly and that when she injuria these individuals came to fear for his physical integrity since a énergumène who attack an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman a child or an old man ultimately anyone lower than him 
the episode came to ten seven hours on a tuesday as another in a neighborhood usually quiet 
the dog has gémi all day . 
of course , we have filed complaints to the police station in the neighborhood , even if we doubt that works great thing and not to touch the sensitivities we just want to say that the cowardly killers were spanish 
the indignation has led us to denounce this fact 
we do not understand what is happening among young people for that they are fun to mistreat free a defenceless animal which gives us the affection of friendship and keeps us company 
we do not know where is the good education and respect of animals and people 
michelin and fesvial sets for wearing helmets 
the michelin tyre manufacturer in cooperation with the spanish foundation for road safety fesvial has launched a campaign to encourage wearing helmets mainly among motorcyclists youngsters as have announced today the two structures 
this initiative is intended to raise awareness of the importance of wearing helmets , since it is the only element of protection to avoid head injuries or even death in the event of an accident in two wheels 
michelin has indicated that this campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety that goes beyond the design and manufacture of products always safer and said that it contributed to this goal by other actions to educational and informative 
this new campaign of encouragement to the port of the helmet in two wheels under the motto to be but not to be will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than five hundred garages of motorcycles in order to ensure the widest spread 
finally michelin has stressed that road safety is a constant concern for the company because as tyre manufacturer two-wheeled vehicles one of its main goals is to develop products always safer 
the sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing 
after almost two years the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel 
the nine thousand four hundred and twenty five vehicles registered in november in spain represent an increase of 12 comma six % compared to two thousand eight and what is more important they represent the first increase after twenty two consecutive months of decline , according to the figures from the trade union business sectors of manufacturers anfac and ganvam the dealers 
however , it should be qualify the good news since the reference to the comparison the month of november two thousand eight has been particularly bad with a decrease of 60 % compared to the previous year 
consequently despite the twist last month the registrations accumulated during these eleven months are 40 % below those of the previous year 
since january if we add all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles derived from cars pick up fourgons vans and light trucks lightweight chassis four twenty fifteen thousand eight hundred fifty three have been sold 
the big clouds that affect the more their demand have not provided dispelled indeed although they are also bought by individuals most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized businesses who pay in almost 100 % of cases thanks to an external funding 
as well as more restrictions involved by limiting the bank credits it must add other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation 
faced with this situation , and unlike cars aid to the purchase of the two thousand e have little used 
in addition to individuals , the self-employed and small businesses who want to acquire a commercial vehicle slight of less than three comma five tonnes with a level of emissions of co two which does not exceed the hundred sixty grams per kilometre can also benefit but the number of operations speak of him even 
yesterday among ganvam we recalled again the need for the administration to attach attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles , trucks and buses 
the association of dealers provides a year two thousand ten similar to that which ends to which it calculates a drop in sales of cars and four four of ten nine % 
the emergency braking is now obligatory 
as has occurred with the system anti-lock brakes abs and , as this will take place with the esp stability control the braking systems of emergency will be a mandatory part on european cars 
they are already mandatory in cars of tourism and light commercial vehicles while newly registered for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been set until the end of february two thousand eleven 
the measure imposed by the european union aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians , even if by his mode of action , it can also help prevent many rear shocks 
the assistant emergency braking is increasing the pressure on the brakes in emergency cases detected by the system through kicked given by the driver 
but it does not always keeps the pressure until the end 
according to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars bosch one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to rely on the brake before the collision and half of them had not benefited from its full force 
up to 1 cent accidents 
the intervention of the aid in revancha requires the most of the brake system , reducing the distance that the car needs to stop 
according to a study from the eu if all cars were equipped with this type of elements until thousand cent fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be prevented each year 
this reduction would be even more important with popularizing of the so-called intelligent systems emergency braking we calculate that a sinister on four with injuries would be avoided 
in this case the vehicle is equipped with a system that thanks to a radar or a camera detects the obstacles and warns the driver in addition to act on the brakes slightly 
if the driver reacts it aid by increasing the pressure on the pedal if necessary
