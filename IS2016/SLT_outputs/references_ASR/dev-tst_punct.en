surgeons in los angeles have said that they were outraged said mr camus 
i heard about a possible further judicial proceedings has t he says 
jean claude camus has estimated that johnny hallyday party was much too quickly to los angeles with the permission of the surgeon parisian 
i had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and i was amazed given that i have had me even two hernies discales has t it added 
a little earlier on rtl he had indicated that the singer was apparently party without tube with nothing after his operation parisian 
dr stéphane delajoux is very experienced in the middle artistic 
he had made the actress marie trintignant in vilnius a few days before his death in a clinic of neuilly on seine where he was at the time 
in two thousand seven he had also made the actress charlotte gainsbourg to reduce a hématome following a brain haemorrhage 
but it is also a doctor to the reputation sulfureuse repeatedly condemned by justice in dossiers in medical liability as well as for tax evasion and fraud 
am olivier metzner the lawyer of the order of doctors has been accused of being a man without scruples continued regularly before the council of the next and that is not advisable 
after several days of silence dr stéphane delajoux spoke friday through his lawyer david koubbi me 
this one has indicated that the speech was perfectly well and that the tests afterward were normal 
the operation was not hemorrhagic and was therefore not the laying of a drain has t it added 
in any case the tour of the singer whose troubles for health are multiplying since this summer seems incidentally 
obviously a resumption of the tour the eight january in amiens ndlr as planned it seems very short said mr camus 
the association udf tone and increase the amount the new centre not to use its acronym 
the association udf controlled by the modem françois bayrou responded friday to the takeover attempt of the president of the new centre hervé morin on the acronym of the former giscardien party putting it in remains not to use it on any support under pain of prosecution 
hervé morin has publicly announced its intention to recover the acronym udf judging that françois bayrou does not deserve to defend his legacy policy after having reached out to the left 
the defence minister , whose party is a partner of the ump had also planned to confirm this strategy on saturday before the national council of the nc 
to support its approach has received the support of the member hervé de charette ex ump happened in nc which claims ownership of the brand udf to have been the first to the table in two thousand four at the national institute of industrial property 
but on friday evening , the office of the association udf controlled by the friends of françois bayrou who do not intend to let themselves be deprived is out of his silence to launch a formal notice to the minister and member of the order of not using the acronym and convey to them the property of the brand under pain of prosecution 
you have multiplied in recent days the statements indicating that you were going to offer your political movement to resume the acronym udf writing the association in a letter signed by ten nine of the twenty four members of the office that françois bayrou and marielle de sarnez the modem as senator jean arthuis the centrist alliance 
you also believed to follow up on your militant material and on page of care of your website the name of this movement the new centre of the slogan the udf today also see the signatories of the letter 
as you know you have no right to the use of this symbol explains the office of the udf that remains the nc to immediately withdraw the mention of the name of the udf of all medium and its website 
it also asks hervé de charette to convey the property of the brand to its rightful copyright holders 
if you were not the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of adherents of the udf prevent the signatories 
in their letter they stipulate that the udf is a fully-fledged political movement for a thousand nine hundred seventy eight and recalling that mr morin and his friends had made the choice to leave in two thousand seven to create a movement competitor as others had done in two thousand two to create the ump 
the new centre has therefore no right to use the acronym udf union for french democracy 
they also recall that the last congress of the udf voted in two thousand seven its accession to the modem for three years and the creation of an office responsible for defending the material and moral interests of training founded by valéry giscard d 'estaing 
as for hervé de charette continues the bureau when he has tabled the brand it was no longer adhering to the udf for three years but the ump 
it benefits scandalously and fraudulently the abscence depositing the acronym for the udf carry out to his account 
this inappropriate is turning into a crime expose they mock before on the strategy of the nc it seems to us that in politics , as in life , it is more worthy to make a name for itself even to try to get out of the anonymity by taking fraudulently a name which has not right 
case liliane bettencourt françois marie banier will be judged for abuse of weakness 
the court in nanterre decided friday to judge the artist françois marie banier in order to determine whether as in accuses the daughter of the billionaire liliane bettencourt he has taken advantage of a state of weakness of the 80-year-old for the plunder of part of his fortune 
the photographer sixty two years known for his photographs of stars will be judged the 15 and 16 april two thousand ten for abuse of weakness a criminal offence to a maximum penalty of three years in prison and three hundred and sixty fifteen thousand euros fine 
this decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families of france in which mother and daughter are squabbling with each other while taking the reins of the empire of cosmetics the oréal 
but the fifteenth alleged bedroom has also ordered that a medical expertise of liliane bettencourt aged four twenty seven years should be conducted collectively by three doctors 
heir and main shareholder of the oréal has always refused to submit to such scrutiny at least not in the terms offered by the public prosecutor of nanterre during the investigation 
doctors appointed on friday will issue a report before the ten march two thousand ten saying especially if liliane bettencourt was able to find in a state of weakness and what periods 
i think it will submit 
i am going to speak said at the exit of the hearing , the lawyer of mrs bettencourt am georges kiejman 
for its part the lawyer of françoise bettencourt meyers am olivier metzner has welcomed the decision of the court 
it is an excellent new expertise will demonstrate that it mr banier has manipulated this elderly lady that we must protect has t it said 
for two years the single girl liliane bettencourt has engaged in criminal proceedings against françois marie banier photographer and artist is that it accuses of having benefited for years from the weakness of his mother to obtain a billion euros of donations in the form of cheques insurance contracts life or paintings of masters 
for its part liliane bettencourt has always refuted have been manipulated by the photographer that it sees as a longstanding friend 
while the court should examine the admissibility of the action taken by mrs bettencourt meyers the pleadings lawyers have sometimes turned to large family display friday 
the lawyer of liliane bettencourt reported three letters sent by his client in a thousand nine hundred four twenty ten nine two thousand three and two thousand five to his notary in which she said beware the husband of françoise bettencourt meyers 
in the letter dated two thousand three liliane bettencourt added , according to the lawyer , could you explain to my daughter that i wrote to banier once twice a day for 15 years 
françoise i have never been able to speak to him since his marriage 
for its part the nanterre prosecutor has again estimated that the complainant was not admissible to act as a judge of the supervisory authorities refused these last few days with its request to open a process of judicial protection for his mother 
liliane bettencourt has full capacity to act in justice it is not under protection and has no tutor 
nobody else has to act in his place said the representative of the public prosecutor mary chrsitine daubigney 
the tribunal has finally decided that it is consulted once the trial will take place on the admissibility of mrs bettencourt meyers 
managerial revolution or end of the economic intelligence 
if nothing changes in the governance of big french companies our fight for the development of the economic intelligence will have been in vain etc . 
for more than a decade the attitude of the management of large companies toward its employees recalls the position of the companies toward consumers before the revolution marketing it is to join the staff to values determined to high as it was used to impose the consumer products invented by the technicians from the factory 
by putting the customer at the heart of the company the revolution marketing has called the strategies of conquest of markets to the place although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected factors of preferences of back regularly clienteles 
a demobilisation of employees can lead to a deadly demoralization 
suicides at france telecom psa and renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon which particularly affects executives 
this demobilization seriously undermining the development of all intellectual functions of the company including the r&d and more economic sense 
indeed the ie requires all the stakeholders etc a pro-active and a forward-looking vision it requires the part of employees a commitment that the revenue management entirely vexatious authoritarian 
that is why we are calling for a revolution managerial skills to set the staff at the centre of the company in the same way that the customer 
the usefulness of any internal surveys 
internal polls as the questionnaire submitted by orange to its employees will they encourage this revolution in the practices managériales 
unfortunately i fear not 
firstly because i saw that in a new situation any structure in finally gets after detours to do primarily etc what it has always done 
then because authoritarianism a pathology of power grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures 
finally , because most of the leaders have a simplistic of human behaviour 
from the great engineering schools they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology 
they adopt by intellectual comfort the old theory behavioriste cranked up recently by neuroscience uniennes states and widely publicised , unbeknownst to them by the institutes of studies and the media 
and by suggesting that it is possible to use the levers sic the commitment of a recent survey of ipsos appeared in the figarofr reinforces t it managers in a posture of mechanistic governance unsuited to the world today 
identify and measure the factors of mobilisation 
instead the revolution managerial skills necessary to the proper functioning of the modern companies means to adopt a final vision of human behavior 
it is to incorporate in any reasoning or practice of governance a fundamental observation for employees the commitment for the company is only possible if this one is clear as a means of achieving a part of their dreams of their ambitions of their projects 
currently only the studies from the analysis motifonctionnelle adopt this design of the motives of the employees 
these studies have shown that they consider their company based on a predetermined ideology that allows them through their perceived image of the company to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life plans 
thanks to the identification and to the extent these factors of mobilisation business leaders can control predict and anticipate their social performance and put their management of human resources at the place 
they create a breeding ground for development of a concerted economic intelligence robust and effective

the american right has welcomed friday the speech the eve in oslo by barack obama satisfied that the nobel peace prize two thousand nine has defended the concept of a just war against the enemies of the united states 
the conservatives who had brocardé awarding the prize to mr obama the nine october applauded this time the speech like sarah palin former candidate for the vice presidency in elections two thousand eight 
i liked what he said said mrs palin heroine of the right wing of the republican party in the usa today newspaper adding have it even addressed the issue of the war sometimes necessary in his memoirs that have just been published

we must stop these terrorists all there has t it estimated 
mr obama , who has inherited the two wars of his predecessor george w bush in iraq and afghanistan has tried thursday to oslo to justify the use of force a way to explain his decision to send thirty thousand additional troops in afghanistan nine days earlier 
another opponent of mr obama newt gingrich has estimated that the president had done a great job in oslo 
i found that the speech was really very much welcomed the former chairman of the house of representatives , which has particularly appreciated the mention of the existence of evil in the world in the presidential words 
by some side i found this speech to historical fact said mr gingrich questioned during the radio programme the takeaway 
the former elected regarded by some as a possible candidate for the republican nomination for the presidential election two thousand twelve has said it is pleased to have seen a president of the left remind members of the nobel committee that they would not be free and could not put a price of peace if the use of force was no 
for michael gerson old pen of george w bush handed over to the washington post columnist , mr obama gave a speech very american 
in addition to present itself as a citizen of the world as he always does he spoke as an american president reminding the europeans that they live in a bubble of security that they have not created , and they do not do much to preserve has estimated mr gerson 
among the few right not to be convinced a falcon to the bush era , the former ambassador to the united nations john bolton described the speech of dull spouted and without inspiration on the site national review online 
has the left of the president the representative democrat dennis kucinich has alarmed to see barack obama justify the use of force 
when we wraps the war in the notion of justice we can easily justify the killing of innocent people has t it warned 
the press centre left glowing , however , remained in the place of president 
the los angeles times while continuing to think that the nobel was awarded prematurely to mr obama described his speech superproduction even for a speaker known for its talent 
the speech of oslo should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflicts poverty and oppression has reignited the daily californian 
mr obama gave the speech that he had felt the new york times the judging both dark and inspiring

the turkish courts dissolved the kurdish pro party decision with serious consequences 
the turkish constitutional court said friday the dissolution of the main kurdish pro party of the country , a decision which was immediately followed by demonstrations of anger in the kurdish community in the south east of the country and istanbul . 
this decision could greatly complicate the task of the government , which has just reach out to the kurdish community to try to put an end to twenty five years of conflict 
the democratic society party dtp has been dissolved because it had become a hotbed of activities prejudicial to the independence of the state and to its unity indivisible said in the press , president of the court hasim kiliç at the end of four days of deliberations 
the decision has been taken unanimously of eleven judges while a qualified majority of seven was required to give the dissolution indicated mr kiliç adding that thirty seven senior party including its president ahmet türk and the member aysel tugluk are banned from politics for five years 
the judge also announced the closure of the parliamentary immunity had enjoyed türk mr and mrs tugluk by the treasury and the confiscation of assets in the party 
the dtp has 21 seats in parliament on five hundred fifty 
its leaders had warned before the verdict that members leave parliament rather than sit as members without label 
the decision follows a procedure launched in two thousand seven by the prosecutor of the court of cassation abdurrahman yalçinkaya who accuse the dtp to obey the directives of the kurdistan workers party pkk regarded as a terrorist organisation by ankara and many countries 
many observers believe that the dtp is the political wing of the pkk rebels legal 
the party holds , however , that it has no organic links with the pkk but refuses to call this one terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with him 
the court 's verdict comes at a time when the government has to reach out to the kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights to try to stem the support of the kurds to the pkk and put an end to the conflict 
the leaders of the dtp had said that a dissolution could lead to an escalation of tension in the south is anatolian where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the pkk leader abdullah öcalan degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks 
when the news of justice a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the dtp to diyarbakir , the main city in the south is populated by majority kurds 
the police fired tear-gas grenades and used water cannon while protesters throwing molotov cocktails or stones with insurrections 
a hundred people protested also in istanbul 
after the verdict mr türk said that the decision of the justice system would deepen despair 
turkey cannot solve the kurdish issue ndlr by banning a party has t he said to the press 
the government formed by a party from the islamist movement has also deplored the decision 
we are opposed in principle to the closure of parties 
this does not solve said minister of energy taner yildiz 
this decision is a total torpedoing the democratic opening launched by the government has commented on the political analyst ahmet insel 
of course , we can expect a reaction from the pkk has t it added 
on thursday the pkk has claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of turkey one of the deadliest of these last few months 
the first snow can fall 
what would wolfgang brauburger it is a winter of rigorous 
but the head of the service of spadework and sablage roads fes specifies that this is not to annoy the citizens 
it is simply that the agents can test the technique of vehicles and learn the master 
and after the métérologues this could well be for this weekend 
more than 300 agents and one hundred and twenty vehicles is ready to tackle the snow and ice 
the fes follows a very elaborate plan 
mr brauburger explains that as soon as it starts to neiger on the city of frankfurt and that temperatures fall below zérode large vehicles of sablage travel twenty main routes used so-called routes has 
this includes the streets to great movement the main arteries as the neue weg and hanauer landstraße 
firefighters are also included the access routes to transport the walkability and streets in slope like the atzelbergstraße 
the agents of fes start their service to three hours of the morning 
in the case of the thousand need 40 kilometres of road owner must be salt with a road basis which adheres well in three hours maximum 
that is why the service of fes begins at three o 'clock in the morning so that the roads to be released when starts the trafficking of daily migrations 
where it becomes more difficult is when the snow starts to fall to seven hours 30 in the morning 
this causes problems we said the head of the service of spadework and sablage roads because no driver is prepared to miss the vehicles of salting 
then it does more snow we access routes and roads of servicing as the rat beil straße 
the sidings and streets latérales come to last 
mr brauburger knows that it is always a few complaints 
has five hours of the morning the team 's pedestrian fes gets in the way to reach in priority areas deemed dangerous and the passages 
as for the cycle paths the services of fes usually do not address 
mr brauburger specify that there is a special service in frankfurt is responsible to monitor the state bridges between twenty two hours and four hours thirty 
as the ice to form very quickly on these surfaces vehicles involved salting as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees 
it also happens that the police to appeal to this special service snack of need 
the cradle of dinosaurs 
the tawa hallae looked like the other carnivorous dinosaurs this upright was about two feet long for a comma fifty meters its members after his skull were powerful lying was provided teeth acérées recourbées his short arms and third countries were coming to an end by claws in sickle and he had a long tail 
if this species had lived a few million years later it would not have been exceptional 
but as reports sertling nesbitt of the university of texas in austin and his colleagues in the journal science on thursday the tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs containing the morpho-functional characteristics 
this animal lived there are two hundred and fifteen million years ago in new mexico who faisaità the time part land masses of supercontinent the pangea and was to ecuador 
sertling nesbitt said that the discovery of tawa sheds a new light the evolution of the first dinosaurs 
indeed it tells us the kinship ties the distribution and characteristics of recent 
it is in two thousand six that sertling nesbitt has undertaken searches in the company of others on the site of these paleontologists gohst ranch in northern new mexico 
randall irmis of the natural history museum in utah and a member of the team searches tells it happens sometimes find a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a layer sédimentaire dating from the trias 
scientists have very soon realised that a portion of these bones belonged to a new species 
the surveys have updated the remains of five specimens 
a discovery that confirms the theories about the beginnings of dinosaur evolution 
researchers have dubbed it the name of tawa after the word of the indians hopi people for the sun god 
for sterling nesbitt it is a quite exceptional discovery fossils of dinosaurs from the trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of bone incomplete 
all the experts in paleontology do not share this enthusiasm 
for example , martin sander of the university of bonn does not find that this discovery is particularly spectacular it says , however , that it enables us to confirm some theories about the beginnings of dinosaur evolution 
according to the current state of knowledge the dinosaurs have emerged on earth about two hundred and thirty million years 
most fossil of the older , however , are fragmented and incomplete which makes it very difficult the classification of all first dinosaurs 
the experts are wondering , among other things , to what time the sauriens were divided into three groups of major developments the théropodes carnivoresqui include the t. rex and the velociraptor emerged later and whose down the birds the sauropodes quadrupedal animals on the long neck and those who are related and the herbivores ornithischiens including the species such as the triceratops and stégosaure 
according to the studies of s nesbitt and his colleagues the tawa is one of the first théropodes 
this species to present a report interesting features both primitive and developed s nesbitt said 
researchers have found signs that suggest that the tawa hallae possèdait small air bags in his bones at the level of the skull like the birds that are the descendants of théropodes 
these small pockets of air facilitate the breath of birds compared to mammals 
it seems that in the tawa hallae the vertebrae have also been partially met air 
according to randall irmis the tawa is one of the oldest théropodes with small air bags in his bones 
as the lines related the immense sauropodes owned also air bags and a backbone slight we can think that their ancestor of this innovation already had beneficial 
three successive waves of migration to north america 
as the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in south america researchers have concluded that the sauriens were emerged there 
therefore the three major lineages of evolution are divided and have spread from south america to the rest of the world that is to say the whole land masses who formed the supercontinent pangea 
this seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of these paleontologists has also found the remains of two other théropodes which are not particularly related 
the three species can disembark from a common ancestor would have migrated argue researchers 
alan turner of the natural history museum in new york and co-author of the journal science studies said that there would have been at least three waves of migration to north america 
of course there are some contradictions 
martin sander paleontologist in bonn said that there is a species even more former the silesaure who lived in poland which belongs to a group related to dinosaurs 
according to him it may give a mistaken view because there is in south america a large number of fossils of dinosaurs that have been preserved so that there is virtually no on other continents 
by contrast how dinosaurs are they managed to become the dominant tétrapodes of the secondary era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line the branch of reptiles remains today a mystery 
at the time of the dinosaurs trias shared their habitat with many other reptiles such as with ancestors of present-day crocodiles and with many other sauriens 
towards the end of the trias dinosaurs are spread over the entire planet , thereby promoting the development of many new species while others were related have disappeared between the trias and the jurassic 
such a success , however , is not eternal 
to explain this transformation martin sander sees two hypotheses 
there may have been a mass extinction to which the dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles had disappeared 
or so the dinosaurs were better suited and they have therefore been able to eliminate the competition on the ground 
in any case such a success is not eternal 
one hundred and fifty million years later the fall of a meteorite favorisal' development of a group of animals that had also developed during the trias and since that time essentially in the shadows it was mammals 
the solidarity of vienna in sao paulo 
the list is long and there are signatories of the world

the evacuation by the police of the casino jw goethe university in frankfurt made waves on the entire planet 
two hundred and seventy eight professors and teachers of the university jw goethe but also other institutions of higher education in germany of europe and north and south america , express their solidarity with the protesting students from campus westend 
in a statement drafted in german and english they condemn the intervention of the police requested by the steering committee of the university 
last week , the president of the university werner müller estler did evacuate buildings occupied by students and teachers in grèveaprès that walls and works of art have been daubed with graffiti 
five students were injured during the evacuation 
the signatories believe the damage did not justify a violent also intervention from the commando police against students and teachers who had held their own course 
the evacuation represents an unacceptable breach to freedom of research and education 
the fact of focus exclusively on the acts of vandalism serves only to delegitimize and criminalize the protest and is trying to forget the reasons for the mobilisation 
the steering committee of the university is taken out of the debates that would be needed 
lecturers are demanding that the criminal prosecution to be suspended immediately 
the majority of the occupiers has not taken part in the degradation 
legitimacy of protests 
young people from the trade union verdi of the services sector and the confederation of german unions dgb should show solidarity students 
the protests are the legitimate expression of a growing concern for our own future said alexander klein regional secretary of young people from the trade union verdi 
as to the minister of science of the land of eva hesse kühne hörmann cdu she has campaigned for the action taken by the president of the university and the police 
we are grateful to the president of the university 
any occupation and degradation of places is totally unacceptable has t she says the regional parliament wiesbaden last thursday at the television programme aktuelle stunde 
we understand the sense of protests but do not accept the vandalism has expressed the cdu member of the regional parliament peter beuth 
the groups of the opposition spd the greens and the left the left did not share this view 
the csu takes the pretext of a few walls peinturlurés to criminalise the protests said janine wissler the party of the left left 
instead of thinking about arguments and demands of students they evacuates 
the party of the left has tabled a motion which , after the minister of the interior to submit a report on the conditions of the intervention of the police

zelenograd literal translation green city takes its name wooded hills in the heart which research centres are implanted 
the project s twenty-one a brake for stuttgart 
we cannot put high enough the scale of the project stuttgart twenty-one 
for its supporters , it is nothing less than new heart of europe 
if you want to s twenty and one that is much more than the burial of a railway station more than a massive construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of bade wurtemberg in a despairing chaos of yards for a dozen years 
stuttgart twenty and one is born of the spirit of the years four vingts 
the stations front line with approaches that third countries were coming to an end in full city had a reputation at the time to be the relics of the technique of transport of ten ninth century that were effect of sabot brake modern rail traffic because it was once a lot of time to get the engine of the back to the front 
arrival ruling short beginning it is this that we should do 
that is why the stations front line must disappear in frankfurt and munich 
and stuttgart as a station of passing trains that is half way around on the rail trans-european between paris and budapest bratislava where the slogan heart of europe 
the project s twenty-one will really start although the visions years four vingts are no longer compatible to the reality 
even the most ambitious planners have acknowledged that the cost to bury the station in the respective capitals of hesse and bavaria was exorbitant 
indeed the stations front line are really more problems for the entry and exit since there are modern trains reversible with autorails and pilot car at both ends 
however it is now launching the achievement of stuttgart twenty-one next to the new route of the inter city line towards ulm 
the policies regional and municipal prevailed 
the company of the railways is in part because it is the taxpayer who made the costs of the risks of biggest infrastructure project of the federal republic and not the public 
from the point of view town-planning this project is relatively well justify 
you get a urban space , which according to the graphs planners generated by a computer will be very lush , green 
for the system of rail transport the s twenty-one is harmful 
the station of passage and the enlargement of the section are designed for a traffic people which allowed and it is typical of years four vingts an enormous growth 
then there is still not competition cheap flights 
the policy of the modern traffic should first focus on strengthening freight traffic because transport by rail is much more environmentally friendly as by truck on the road 
but the new route with its inclinaisons is not appropriate to freight trains 
the s twenty-one and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects 
for example six billion euros will be swallowed up in the draft of the swabian 
this is the official figure 
experts believe that 10 to 15 billion is more realistic 
one thing is sure in the next decade the money involved for other points of interface and congestion in the network 
the list of the ministry of transport mentions in any sixty large projects 
one of the most important is the enlargement of the section through the rhine valley 100 four vingts good kilometres 
for a thousand nine hundred twenty four seven this line is built in slow motion 
it would be really urgent to support here in substance on the fungus 
but the project s twenty and a fact the effect of a braking sabot 
the route of the rhine valley is becoming the bottleneck freight traffic international and this in the heart of europe 
the government is considering the judgment on the airport 
the regional parliament wiesbaden the national government has raised the possibility of appeal to the judgement of the administrative court of hesse on the ban of night air flights 
the minister of economics dieter posch fdp has announced that the coalition cdufdp had entrusted experts to examine from a legal point of view the ruling by the administrative court and which is a document containing more than four hundred pages 
the court of kassel justified in a written document that the land should adapt the regulation on the ban of night flights in the case or the construction of the track to aterrissage north west of frankfurt airport would be 
the authorisation of attérir for ten seven had between twenty three hours and five hours of the morning as envisaged in the national government is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against the night air pollution 
the coalition must have decided for the four january if she wants to do an appeals process against the ruling 
the opposition criticism this deadline and trying to put pressure on the government representative for that cirenonce the appeal of the federal administrative court leipzig 
the head of the parliamentary group spd torsten schäfer gümbel invite the cdu and the fdp to return to their promise made before the election , and was to ban night flights otherwise it will be condidéré as a total failure of a given 
it is so damned hard to be allowed to keep its word said the leader of the greens tariq al wazir alluding to the slogan of the fdp éléctoral we keep our promises 
the minister dieter posch refute accusations of schäfer gümbel which claims that the national government is trying to allow when even the night flights with avocasserie and roublardises 
it takes time to review the precise legal 
the coalition does not want to take a decision on the basis of a rapid first impression 
it must be that the decision is legally reliable said stefan müller fdp 
the interpretation of the opposition on the statements of his fraction on the ban of night flights is completely érronée 
us banks repay the aid 
the big american banks very affected by the crisis have taken away from their ties to the state 
the bank of america announced wednesday that it had repaid in full at the treasury forty five billion dollars more than 30 billion euros corresponding to aid in the framework of the rescue plan tarp 
the chain of american television cnbc indicated in a report that citigroup also envisaged repay aid received

the door floor of citigroup did not wish to comment on this information 
in june the banks goldman sachs , jp morgan chase and morgan stanley had repaid the public funds that they had received 
election accelerated 
ultimately , it is when even spent more quickly than expected 
just two weeks after the purge of the current taking the post of chief redacteur nikolaus brender by the board of the german chain zdf the successor is already appointed 
the commission wanted to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment 
peter frey , who runs the drafting berlin zdf was the odds-on favorite 
the chain , however , did not want to officially confirm the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure 
however , it seems that there was also the desire not to further undermine steward of the zdf markus schächter in case the proposal would not be accepted by the board 
frey , who is the candidate of schächter needs the votes of nine members of the committee on 14 
the outcome of the vote was not yet known to the closing of the drafting of this edition 
there are two weeks schächter had proposed to the board of five-year extension of the contract of nikolaus brender but this was rejected 
only seven members of the council were in favour of the renewal of brender and seven others had voted against the impeachment by vote of brender represented a failure although predictable for schächter 
indeed the cdu majority on the board had already suggested several weeks before the vote does not want to renew brender to his post 
it is roland koch , the minister president of land of hesse , who had organised a league against the editor 
he had refused the contract of the esteemed redacteur in chief is extended , citing the fact that the rate of listening to the emissions of information from the zdf had fallen under brender 
that is why the protests were still taking place almost until the vote lashing out at the growing political influence exerted on the zdf 
at the end there was even thirty five experts in public law who had intruded in the debate and who believed that the action of koch was unconstitutional 
but it will have achieved nothing 
peter frey is it 
peter frey is born the four august thousand nine hundred and fifty seven to bingen 
he studied political science pedagogy etles spanish romance languages 
he then worked at südwestfunk radio body rhineland palatinate and the german daily frankfurter rundschau national 
in a thousand nine hundred four twenty three it becomes editor in the zdf first in news magazine heute journal newspaper today 
then its journey continues a thousand nine hundred four twenty eight to nine hundred thousand four twenty ten he was the deputy editor of the times and then corresponding to washington in a thousand nine hundred four twenty eleven splash thousand nine hundred and twenty four twelve then until thousand nine hundred four twenty ten eight he was and the presenter morgenmagazins issuance of fortnightly information presented in the morning until two thousand a he was responsible for the service of foreign policy of the zdf then head of the berlin drafting 
after the disgrace of brender while this one had just been elected journalist of the year by the magazine specialising medium magazin the greens have announced that they laid down a constitutional complaint 
the enemy of koch on board the minister president of rhineland palatinate kurt beck said last week that the länder should transform the intergovernmental treaty of the zdf so that the proposals to staff of steward cannot be blocked by a political majority one-sided 
however beck does not intend to ask for the withdrawal of politicians members of the committees for monitoring the zdf 
peter frey the likely successor to brender had manoeuvred cleverly to the council of administration vehemently criticising the commission in its decision to sack brender 
thanks to this show of journalistic independence schächter was able to propose for the post of editor without losing face even that the board could elect without the soupconne to put in the post a political supporter 
in the representations arithmetic of parties frey is classified left-wing liberal 
cleansing in university studies 
partial success for students after a year of educational strike the ministers of education and cultural affairs länder decide to be more conciliatory in a meeting between ministers and the delegates of the conference of vice-chancellors an agreement has been developed stating that the working conditions of students bachelor or master 's degree should be improved 
has the future students should be able to overcome their studies 
they are particularly agreed to reduce the weight of the examinations a single review should allow us to close the module of study chosen 
more of the burden of work will have to be reconsidée to ensure the proportions realistic and acceptable 
the political authorities and higher education institutions want to facilitate the recognition of exams between universities and abroad 
the states are also committed to hold joint structural requirements more flexible for the smuggling of bachelor and masters 
at the regional level there must be no regulation different from one province to another 
less examinations 
since the beginning of the student protests last june the education minister länder and university rectors have repeatedly in the mouth the buzzword étudiabilité 
but for the first time this expression seems to take a practical significance 
the accreditation council has decided to greatly reduce the number of some tests every module must be reached by a single examination can we read in a document of a thirty pages on the future conditions for admission to the university cycles 
reinhold grimm president of the council of accreditation says that significantly reducing the burden of the examinations we should be able to stop the slide that hurting considerably in the étudiabilité 
the étudiabilité should also be in the future the decisive criterion of organisation of studies 
the modules as the substance must be examined carefully to see if we can avoid this feeling of stifling that it sometimes feels in the choice of course 
hamburg berlin , according to the latest knowledge kunduz raid on the opposition believes that the defence minister karl theodor zu guttenberg csu is guilty of deliberate deception 
students should have the opportunity and the leeway to allow and encourage the personal initiative 
the new regulation will apply to access to the new university rounds but will also be adapted to the existing cycles 
these cycles must be réaccrédités every five years which means , however , that it is only by two thousand 15 that all rounds have been examined 
ten agencies competent accreditation on the entire federal territory who depend on accreditation council created by the länder 
in october the education ministers had exerted some pressure on the länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes are not too loaded and the regime exams not too strict 
in some länder universities and specialist colleges have already heard with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures 
the rhineland palatinate is so far the only land to have agreed to give more money to the development of the bologna process 
with these funds universities must organise massive programmes and strengthen the offices of educational guidance as well as the offices of examinations and the service of international relations 
the länder and universities to provide a budget of ten million euros 
beginning two thousand ten the government wants to submit to parliament an amendment to the law on higher education institutions 
following this , there will be no more than a single examination to close its studies 
the organization of studies will be more flexible more , it must be able to ensure the recognition of increased notes other institutions of higher education and access to the master 's should be simplified 
by the end of next year létudiabilité of all university cycles will be examined 
last thursday the government and the opposition again have debated the question of study conditions in the country 
the decisions were appreciated but there have been some criticisms 
the federal president of the union of students socialists has indicated that he would like the organisation of the educational policy is more in the future behind the closed doors of ministers and university rectors 
at the latest after the strike educational students as people concerned should be able to speak a little 
the future diplomés of higher education we received the support of president delegates from the conference of vice-chancellors hrk margret wintermantel experience of students we is very useful has t she said thursday during a meeting with the education ministers länder with which the hrk is working on a joint project of reform 
for the trade union of education and science gew the decisions taken in bonn do not go far enough it calls for the right and the possibility for each graduate bachelor to register to a cycle of masters 
andreas keller member of the steering committee of gew request that the länder provide students bachelor today that tomorrow there will be enough places for studies in the masters and the conditions of studies as good as possible 
the länder must therefore hire more lecturers 
by contrast the education ministers have not mentioned the possibility of ease access to master 
more than a note at the bottom of page on herta müller 
it is by these words arrival in germany and it is a beautiful almost more control that begins the poet werner söllner in which he thématise in scraps phrases troubling the experiences of a dissident arrived in germany that won the freedom , but has lost at the same time its territory linguistic 
werner söllner born in thousand nine hundred fifty and one to banat in romania was first professor of german and english in bucharest and later director of collection in a publishing house for youth before settling in frankfurt 
söllner has received various literary prize in thousand nine hundred four twenty thirteen it took the much-desired professorship of poetry of goethe university in frankfurt and for two thousand two it is director of the forum of literature of hesse to the house of artist of mousonturm in frankfurt 
he has done a lot of talk about him in literary circles not last tuesday at a congress in munich where the theme was the german literature in romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your files securitate 
visibly destabilized and embarrassed söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his colleagues writers germano romanians as richard wagner william totok franz hodjak and helmuth frauendorfer that he had worked as an informant for the police policy securitate 
söllner received in nine hundred thousand four twenty nine the price of the german language , together with some of the participants 
the trials of recruitment had begun insidiously in thousand nine hundred sixty and eleven 
i am concludes söllner so someone who has not been able to resist the trials of intimidation of the securitate 
the poet werner söllner is the informant walter im walter 
almost simultaneously with the honoration nobel prize for herta müller and his literary disentangled copies with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of german authors from romania in a case which clearly shows the abyss and the heinous act of a political system based on police surveillance and spying 
werner söllner is all one can say after current knowledge not only guilty but also victim 
in his own dossier securitate im walter has played a role ensures the specialist literature michael markel after the confession of söllner and it refers to the positive influence of im walter who had intervened in its favour 
he had been able to the draw of all the difficult situations at the time of after markel 
markel felt the need to make this comment moralde 
the form in which söllner made his statement and before this audience was unexpected , however , the admission of a former dissident its cooperation with the romanian secret services is , in fact , not so surprising 
germany is a reserve enjoyable for the spies of the securitate had already written herta müller in july in the newspaper die zeit after having read the nine hundred 14 pages of his own dossier 
we can assume that the victims have made of speculation and sometimes have guessed what real names last hid the names of loans sorin voicu and also walter 
instead of germany where between time consultation of files of the stasi is a reliable process the attitude to the legacy of the files of the securitate is still very confused 
a systematic explanation has been repeatedly frustrated and slowed in the past years 
it is only by thousand nine hundred four twenty ten nine that a national council corresponding to the institution birthler has been created to work to assimilation of archives of the securitate cnsas but the return of the files has dragged on since 
there is for two thousand five a law which defines the management of archives 
that the influence of former members of the securitate in romania is still very large is confirmed by the interview with a former head of the securitate of temesvar which after the announcement of the award of the nobel prize to herta müller is extended so very dismissive of the winner 
she had a psychosis and in the end had questioned only once 
the disgrace of power was thought to be able to speak here without any gene under the guise of freedom of expression 
certainly many of the questions are inevitable associated with the case söllner as so often happens in a context of guilt hidden 
why now that has been despoiled the reaction of the listeners to the admission of söllner gives us hope that the result of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst to know that by accusations and a sense of shame 
on the genesis of the work of herta müller which has yesterday received the nobel prize is more than a note at the bottom of page 
turmoil in the champions league 
we had the impression that a representative there could best coming straight from a christmas party cool on which the manufacturer of articles of sport had spread its goods when the new coach vfb christian gross monta at a quarter to midnight in a class mercedes % had just call an orange plastic bag of supplier to the hand 
the man whose skull bald drew attention allowed himself to drive in the city that it was foreign still 
otherwise our quinquagénaire could take him even the wheel he had not drunk alcohol , and this was not drunk happiness 
he had spent a pleasant evening but tomorrow we needed to resume the work 
because it is now that it was going to start 
the words of switzerland that we had to take three days earlier were clear we have reached the final eighth of this is to say in the champions league thanks to our three two points against unirea urziceni romania but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by the success it will be a brutal struggle not to fall 
the hard work we expected sunday 
here it is again in mainz the results of the champions league daily 
and it will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three goals of hurried marica five träsch eight and pogrebnyak eleven 
lottery 
the eighth final of the champions league match go thousand six hundred and ten seven two thousand three hundred and twenty four february return match nine hundred and ten thousand six hundred and ten seven march will be learned the fate the ten eight december in nyon 
the joy of the entry of the successor to cap pistols babbel was therefore moderate 
and the joy was not only moderate among those who brought a chance which had forwarded professionals in stuttgart destabilised motivated and the pleasure of play 
i have been to see the players and i told them that they should concentrate on their strengths i have advised them to be more courageous explained the plumber of souls gross the recipe for success that sounded if bienmais who was more of an effect with the healer babbel 
it has triggered a certain magic confessed jens lehmann supporter of babbel in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that you would never have believed possible 
and sami khedira which after weeks of inflated pause to injury as the best player thanks to his dynamism tried to describe the phenomenon seen by a proverbial fresh winds and working methods of the new leader is someone who is taking action and requires discipline 
that is what we need in the current situation 
but apparently babbel had missed 
the vfb stuttgart has not yet passed the course warned the manager horst heldt 
for the moment vfb stuttgart are in need of tenacity 
just as gross players and the manager tightlipped about to overstate the victory against a defense totally overwhelmed and weakened guests romanians 
they had also won in glasgow before having had four days later a bad awakening to leverkusen with the zero two points four objecta khedira 
horst heldt signala the manager that they had well reached one of the goals of the season but they had other which were still far 
we have not yet past the difficult hurdle 
that heldt the day of his 40th anniversary does not have the heart to do the festival even after the first victory at home for three months is of the events of the weekend that a television interview the guardian of aim jens lehmann did pick up just before the start of the game 
there are decisions that other take and not jens contrecarrait heldt in response to the criticism of lehmann 
he accused the direction of weakness of style and said that it had decided to change of coach under the pressure of fans pubertaires 
lehmann had judged also as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and envy the fact that his day of free after matches has been removed him 
the statements of lehmann were marked by a pure selfishness slid heldt and announced the consequences for the guardian of aim 
they risked more become friends for life these two 40-year-olds 
in any cast they agreed to everything else that is to say that without the work of the group by the coach replaced the strong sports representation restive and would not have been possible 
babbel and his assistants have been for a large part in the success rétorquèrent heldt and lehmann in chorus and even the man in the plastic bag acquiesça

the case kunduz 
frontal attack by the opposition , the leader of the green group jürgen trittin has accused the minister of defense guttenberg of lying in the case of the case kunduz 
the spd party and the left the left are calling on the chancellor explanations 
hamburgberlin after considering the latest information on the air attack of kunduz the opposition has accused the minister of defence karl theodor zu guttenberg csu to have délibérémentdissimulé some facts 
the minister has intentionnellementformulé a fiction on the murderous hits of two lorries tanks in september said the head of the green group jürgen trittin saturday during the emission of information of the chain tagesschau ard , the journal of 20 m . 
clearly this means he has lied 
the order to kill , was given in total disregard for the rules of the international security assistance force in afghanistan , isaf 
this is in essence the content of the report available to nato and which has been read by mr guttenberg said trittin 
last friday , according to new revelations of the media the objective of lafrappe was in fact not to destroy the stolen trucks but sought to eliminate two taliban leaders important 
according to the report of the inquiry of nato one hundred and forty two people had been killed or injured in the attack american airline which was launched at the request of the german colonel goerg klein military commander of kunduz 
the greens the spd and the left have asked saturday chancellor angela merkel cdu to vote as soon as possible before the federal parliament and reveal what guttenberg really knew about the incident 
jürgen trittin and his colleague from the green party renate künast are of the opinion that angela merkel must say clearly if the strategy of targeted massacre is part of the government 's afghan policy fédéralet if the chancellery the army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy 
the door floor of the government categorically reject these criticisms 
the chancellery has in no way influenced the interventions of the military in afghanistan has t he says 
on saturday the voices were increasingly strong to express doutesquant the real reasons the referral of the inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan and the secretary of state peter wichert as it had been presented by the ministry 
according to the intelligence of the newspaper spiegel the information that they had called to guttenberg concerning the attack trucks tanks were both correct and complete 
officially they would have concealed the existence of the report of nato and hidden the minister some details troublesome 
in the vicinity of the two senior officials , it suggests , however , that they have informed the ministry of defence of the existence of several reports that a document of two pages of colonel klein as well as a report of the military police 
the frankfurter allgemeiner sonntagszeitung reported that wichert would have meanwhile demanded in a letter a clarification of the facts 
until now it has not been answered 
on saturday the ministry did not wish to comment on the allegations and referred to the committee of inquiry of the federal parliament which was going to be the next wednesday in order to provide the light on the facts in question 
the worlds of dream 
some see all awake images and hear voices that nobody else sees or hears 
it is not only among the mental ill or under the effect of the drug that the boundaries between imagination and reality mix 
as long as these phenomena occur during sleep everything is going very well 
when we are laying in our bedrooms overshadowed we can do without barriers to dreams and wildest fantasies 
however the one who awake experienced dream intends to and see things that others do not perceive quickly the reputation in our western world to be crazy or drugged or at least be an original 
such images and voices do not appear that among the mental ill or under the effect of the drugs 
this is our imagination that is in question is the same neural activity which allows us to design houses paint pictures or write novels but sometimes prompts the boundaries between the dream the madness and reality to melt 
a state of conscious awakening taking the form of a dream may present itself as the the most diverse in the best case we call this visions at worst madness 
but even if the trigger and the effect is distinguished the visions of the mystical hildegard von bingen the experiences of drugs in the prophet of the new age carlos castaneda member latter of chamanes psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to the process very similar 
there are hallucinations or delusions when the balance of substances neurotransmettrices of the brain first dopamine noradrenalin serotonin and achétylcholine breaks down and that the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted 
hallucinations complex and wild thoughts are very often during a psychosis schizophrenic 
the force of earth 's attraction has more power on the person 
since antiquity philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between the madness and the dream 
for aristotle hallucinations were a form of daydream wilhelm griesinger one of the founders of modern psychiatry found in thousand eight hundred sixty and a great resemblance between the madness and the dream for sigmund freud the dream was even a psychosis with all irregularities imaginations delusions and sensory illusions that the composed 
we are in the autumn two thousand a when henning t turns into a comic strip character 
his body is in two dimensions to the colors criardes 
the land attraction has more power on him he hangs from the ceiling in the tidal 
he feels a sudden 
behind him creatures of devil winged grimaçantes the mouth bloodstained showing teeth 
they continue to give it a few feet with heavy boots flamboyantes the cast against the walls he feels the pain throughout the body 
the voice thundering roar evil outgoing walls and radio 
it can no longer bear these voices who insult and humiliate him 
henning t severs two cables of its chain stereo in fact a loop and attaches it to a hook set the ceiling 
it gets on a baffle and happens the loop around the neck 
it jumps 
the loop stands out 
that is a lesson to you mouthing the voice in a chorus to extract the eardrum goes in a clinic and do you treat 
today henning t has 40 years he lived six acute psychoses the last two years , the first of 20 years soon 
it has been triggered by lsd 
the diagnosis schizo affective paranoid psychosis in addition it is maniaco depressive it takes medication for depression the mania schizophrenia 
he has learned to live with his illness it is married for three years 
during the psychosis i lived fears terrible and despondency profound 
illusions are a cruel reality 
one percent of the population is suffering at least once in their lives of schizophrenia in the psychiatric clinic is the most common illness after the depression 
in a crisis of schizophrenia people can no longer make the difference between the inside and the outside world , they are in a state of hyper arousal , which means that they can suffer from hallucinations megalomania of madness or persecution relational 
it is very common to hear the voice of the voice that dictate who elicited comments or chat 
the optical hallucinations are not uncommon either 
the person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the trivial the brain can no longer filter the disruptive signals the aware is drowned under the sensations 
just as the dream the hype opens the floodgates to a tide of ideas and fantasies outcome of deeper layers of consciousness 
the perception of reality in the hype is centered on the subject , according to professor thomas fuchs head of the department of psychiatry of chu of heidelberg allgemeine psychiatry im universitätsklinikum 
the schizophrenic is in the centre of the situation all meaning focused on him 
at the same time it is reflected in a passive role it is as in a dream overcome by events and may not act on them in an active 
that is why the schizophrenic often feel threatened controlled manipulated 
in general they do not have the opportunity to adjust the reality illusions are a harsh reality wake up is excluded 
to experience a time in his life of a hallucination 
unlike the dream according to fuchs the sensory structure space and the reality that is seen during the psychosis is fundamentally retained 
the thoughts and hallucinations wild are based on the fact the alienation of the experienced takes place in a real framework 
why our brain does it this kind of antics is still a mystery to researchers 
exceptional situations can bring everyone to momentarily lose the perception of reality according to fuchs 
but only a small number of people develop a psychosis 
there seems to have a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia but studies of twins have shown that the genes are not the only factors 
researchers assume that the people involved are tiny brain damage 
we assume that the neural maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development , for example , by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy explains fuchs 
but what remains unexplained that is the way the anomaly of the neural system happens and also the fact that it is not for many years 
environmental factors also play a role stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis if , however , there is predisposition 
of even the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they operate on the neurotransmitters 
when our brain heating 
this is crazy we said professor of psychology erich kasten of lübeck is that the suffering psychotic their hallucinations and take medicines expensive for getting rid of it while others buy drugs very expensive for obtaining them 
the perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a matter of perspective 
kasten brings together for ten years of reports on hallucinations and phenomena illusory images last year he published his results in a book called the world unreal in our head 
the hallucinations do well among the concomitant phenomena typical psychoses but also an impressive number of many other pathologies 
there are among they psychological problems such as borderline or depression but also the migraine epilepsy multiple sclerosis , alzheimer 's disease or head injury 
it is surprising that in certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations 
the hallucinations according to kasten consists of fragments of memories that are normally inhibés 
they take form when the areas of the brain sensory perceptions are overactive or not enough refrénées when our brain 's warm but also when there is lack of stimulation 
drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or a psychosis 
but the lack of stimulus stress the sorrows of love or other mental states exceptional 
in studies a third of participants acknowledges having done at least once in his life experience a hallucination 
in summer two thousand five sarah k has 16 years she lives a small town of pomeranian mecklenburg earlier and it goes to the high school 
a young girl to do everything to true say normal 
if there had not the images and voices 
during the recess happens that a young boy thin the long hair châtain offer him the floor 
when she meets his comrades watch surprised nobody else sees or hears this boy 
they believe that this young girl timid is a lunatic dreamer but sarah k not dream she is certain 
it is awake and wants to see this boy as she sees and hears the girl who is sitting next to it on the bench 
it can even see its presence momentarily 
it is a pleasant sensation she finds this young sympathetic 
am i crazy wonders t it sometimes 
but she knows that this young and other visions are not real and that they are going to disappear again 
the night the outbreaks are generally frightening 
often the visions are cumbersome 
when it is in class happens that it cannot follow the course , because the professor is right presenting a new pupil in her eyes and her ears when it is invisible to others and that the teacher is visibly explaining the picture equations 
the night the outbreaks are generally frightening 
when in the darkness of his bedroom it expects the sleep which happens all too rarely and far too late , it often cannot distinguish if it is awake or dream already if the images that she sees the faces grimaçants or the girl with sanguinolentes cuts on the arms and legs are in front of their eyes open or closed 
let me alone screams t it to these creatures 
it does not speak and his parents and his friends they would for a mad 
autumn two thousand nine sarah k now has 20 years 
it has had its masters last year and she lives with her friend 
it was a year ago hallucinations have stopped 
since she came in contact by the internet with the psychologist kasten she knows very well that it is not crazy 
the madness is also a work of art of despair 
when someone is socially isolated or has not enough incentives the likelihood is that he has hallucinations after a certain time 
i assume that the brain is not quite busy means that there are animation 
sarah k single girl was afraid of other children when she was small and playing often alone 
the hallucinations began when she learned to 13 years that the man she called daddy since she was in age of thinking was not his real father 
these are the same brain regions that are active for the visual hallucinations and acoustic and for the impressions and real sounds so it is very difficult for people like sarah k to tell the difference between the illusion and reality every experience according to kasten took place in the brain , the reality is formed from there 
hallucinations are also images that form in the brain that is why they seem so real 
for kasten night dreams are also a form of hallucination 
the hallucinations of healthy people differ not fundamentally those acute psychoses 
unlike the schizophrenic mentally healthy person is able to recognise that the fantasies are not actual pictures 
that is why kasten advises her patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent 
there is only a step between the dream and the hallucination 
in our world too focused on the conscience has unfortunately been quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for pathology according to michael schmidt degenhard professor in heidelberg and doctor head of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy of the hospital florence nightingale in düsseldorf 
a psychosis is a serious disease painful but which also contains something positive creator madness is a work of art of despair 
schmidt degenhard has studied the form of so-called experience oniroïde a particular form of the change of consciousness awake by the dream 
the experienced oniroïdes semi- dreams are very complex which are perceived as real by anyone who lives and that he cannot differentiate the dream even when it is in a state of awakening 
the state of consciousness oniroïde manifests itself for a trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathie which fully aware do experience a paralysis engine 
according to schmidt degenhard when a human being is threatened by a loss of itself and the world due to a complete inability and sustainable move it replaces the real situation which undermines his life by his own fantasy world which is divorced from the reality 
it is a state of mental limit between the dream and the hallucination 
as it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality a change in the world has to take place , but the real situation is represented in the imagination 
it is actually a form intense resources and interpretation in a situation in itself intolerable organisational capacity which is given to us men not to sink into the nothingness of the loss of consciousness 
everything is real even later in the memories 
the zurichois peter cornelius classen art historian also describes his experiences oniroïdes in his book change of heart as action to safeguard the soul 
he has 40 nine years at a time when its aware hand for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed a transplant during this time , his body is condemned to stay immobile in resuscitation 
claussen plunges in a world that it has created all coins visit places foreigners trip in the time it sees in old man bed in a rail sanatorium a robot to his bedside on her health care 
he lives in the middle ages among the noble that manufacture drugs derived from blood 
it is kidnapped by a greek motorbikes which takes him in his country it surf with his hospital bed in the névé of the alps and meeting a korean mafia 
it absorbs completely in this fantasy world everything is real even later in his memories 
according to claussen these domestic travel differ fundamentally from any dream 
the dream is a state quite different writing it in describing what he has experienced 
on the contrary dreams the memories from the mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later 
we can even say that they are much more distinctive and more intensive the experience real 
the intensity of this had been splintered the horizon of our other everyday experiences according to the psychiatrist schmidt degenhard 
ultimately the mania oniroïdes psychoses hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how much our internal representations of external reality are fragile even in a state of eve 
any change of consciousness summarises the psychologist kasten can cause a distortion of what we call reality 
an experience that can also be quite enriching

burda 
twenty seven years children will take the continuation of the publishing house 
the appointment of kallen as ceo of editions burda is an intermediate solution in the long term hubert burda hope that his two children take up the group of press has t he said to the newspaper spiegel

and for the first time this is not a family member who is the head of editions burda 
the children of burda respectively have ten nine and ten seven years his son felix , which would have today forty two years died a few years ago

the ruins have always happened in the families who have left lead by a capital bulimia which have made enormous speculation unfortunate in thinking that they could climb ever higher 
this has never been my strategy 
i have never had rêvede universal power said burda 
i am absolutely not in the role of a tutor as could be springer and i do not intend to be part of these international leagues as the time these companies have taken too much importance

mazda three i stop a sustainable sporting spirit 
mazda intends to prove that the sporting spirit is not angry with respect for the environment 
to this end she has to include on the mazda three the system of judgment and engine start called i stop a device that at least for the moment is available only on the engine 20 in essence of one hundred and fifty horses 
this second generation of mazda three be illustrated by the note that it has achieved in his whole 
the details the finishing of the vehicle board the behaviour mechanics the system i stop etc . 
all these aspects are remarkable on the new mazda three 
starting with the post of conduct it turns out that the seats are fronts ergonomics and a setting excellent 
the touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant 
by continuing with the whole formed by the picture of control and the console , we see how mazda has continued in the japanese tendency to create a design of interior futuristic with many buttons and orders as well as colorful in red and blue 
this style reminds us , in part , the honda civic 
that is why we can say that both the mazda three that the civic all two japanese contrast with the sobriety of german products and especially with the volkswagen golf that all want to outshine 
continuing with this car compact systems japanese presents a habitability more than enough to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort 
add to this a great trunk to regular forms 
the system of judgment and automatic start-up of the engine at least for the moment is available only on the petrol engine of two litres and one hundred fifty horses and with change manuel of the six speeds 
this engine is a true happiness it illustrates by its finesse its low noise its benefits and the mastery of its consumption 
indeed although the mazda three most requested the diesel models are those who do not carry out a large number of miles per year should not exclude this i stop with petrol engine for both his great comfort of speed that for its consumption controlled 
on the level of equipment the model chosen for the test is the sport in other words that which has the largest number of elements of series 
among the equipment of series the assistant of a change of direction rvm which removes the angle death controls traction and stability the regulator to speed the mirror photosensitive internal the on-board computer on a screen of great size parking sensors air-conditioning independent the sensor of rain and light the bluetooth and the bluetooth audio as well as the wheels of alignment of ten seven inches are particularly remarkable 
more as if this equipment was not enough this version had the pack schedules which for thousand five hundred euros more includes , among other elements of the adaptive headlights bí xenon and audio system with record charger bose 
conclusion 
the mazda three hundred and twenty i stop is one of the best cars of its class tight 
it illustrates in particular by the quality of the materials used by his behavior and by its level of equipment high 
most of those who are not doing a lot of miles per year will be able to choose the version i stop associated with only the gasoline engine , 20 of one hundred and fifty horses 
the only drawback of this model is its high price that lies between 20 and a thousand seven hundred and sixty ten euros for finishing luxury and twenty three thousand two hundred and sixty ten euros for the model tested the sports 
in return for this important sum the mazda three will give us every day a large dose of satisfaction 
first of luxury

the promise of fonpeek 
peek is extremely limited , it is a mechanism which allows only to look at his e-mail without offering the possibility would be that to see certain type of enclosures or surf the internet 
he tabled its five minutes of fame in the united states when the magazine the act as one of the products of the year 
in truth it is more difficult to see in the streets , but the idea seems interesting especially for the young 
unlike the phones peek offers a price and a very low monthly subscription is less than half of what it costs , for example , the subscription data of the iphone 
given his success , the company has launched two new devices one designed exclusively for twitter , the other with a free service of data to life for six times more expensive than the peek 
fonpeek presented yesterday at the event , the web is the european version of invention and its third incarnation 
it is also limited than its american big brother but includes a surprise 
the price of its monthly subscription approximately 12 euros includes the roaming across europe 
those who travel with a smart phone already know what represents the fact of abandoning the data when you cross a border or desperately seeking a cafeteria on wi-fi or a connection of fon to check his mail 
the idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it is a long time that it should function 
indeed some operators have special arrangements and options trip but as far as i am concerned i would need to have made a theory in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small print 
the repeated reminders to the european commission to propose roaming fees affordable in the whole of europe have had a barely perceptible 
outside their country of origin people hesitate to use the data and it does not wrong 
a small device as the fonpeek it is always curious that it is called fon so that it does not have wifi offers this type of tariffs means that operators are starting to think differently and to study various proposals allowing them to make their data network 
the kindle is another good example he understands the downloading of books and other research on the internet 
without subscription and without boat 
it is a device connected and you pay during its purchase and not every month 
and that is what i hope to see a day for the fonpeek an option to purchase with access to life as peek proposes already in the united states 
not that i want to buy it 
i look at my mail on my phone , thank you . 
i would simply because i believe that this is a more fair formula for the consumer 
it would be interesting to see a computer with the same system 
the favorite color of michelle 
the yellow is probably the favorite color of the first lady of the united states 
if it went to the inauguration of barack obama to the presidency of the united states with a dress and a mantle of this color she has chosen the same for the match in the second time without doubt the most important of his life the award in oslo the nobel peace prize 
michelle obama wore a model very similar in these two occasions in addition to their color ressemblante a yellow drawing towards the green with reflections brilliant twice the holding consisted of three coins the dress the jacket and the coat in the same tissues and was adorned with a large embroidery or a collier 
so a first glance it would appear that the first lady of the united states follows the wake of the princess of asturias and has chosen to get the same held 
but the fabric in which are carved up the two blocs makes them very different 
if the assumption of office , it was a delicate manoeuvring thick but it was a printed in oslo velvet 
accessories are also different shoes green to heel way for the first opportunity and a similar model but this time , golden

sixty 15 % of working mothers have had problems professionals because of their maternity 
discrimination at work has increased in recent years , especially for women of young people who want to be mothers 
it is this that reveals the study fertility and career women in spain carried out by the csic in collaboration with the instituto the mujer 
the investigation on nine thousand seven hundred and thirty seven women of 15 to 60 fifteen years leaves no room for doubt sixty 15 % of working mothers have seen their career limited because of motherhood 
the study indicates that there are many differences on the beginning of life as a couple , and the number of children if the woman is working or not , and the type of employment occupied 
those who have not of activity outside the home part-time work or have a little work stable are earlier as couples have their first pregnancy sooner and have more children 
but women who have a stable job mainly in the public sector grow back the entry in life as a couple , and the first pregnancy and have fewer children 
the five women between 30 and 40 nine years with a fixed work have their first child , on average , three comma seven years after being installed as couples this figure happening to four comma a among those who work in the public sector these data shows that women who have a stable job had need more time in their lives for what has led to the postponement of the union and the arrival of children 
more the kinds of jobs exercised influence largely motherhood but less the date of early life explains the common researcher of csic margarita delgado 
the level of studies is another factor that widening the gap of the age of marriage of women and their first child 
according to the survey more the level of training is high , the more they marry and have their first child later 
the difference is also maintains among women of the same generation 
for example , in the group with five between 30 and 40 nine years those that have done studies basic and higher respectively have been mothers for the first time in five comma a twenty and thirty two years on average a comma 
another disctinction also appears between women depending on their level of studies 
while those who have done the basic studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job those having done studies of average level or above reverse this programme and give priority to obtaining a stable work as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child states mrs delgado

a cowardly attack 
last week my mother who has approximately 60 ten years was walking in our neighborhood of the city of fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 10 eight years spent by her side and our dog blood mélé saved the aps and weighing no more than six pounds and without saying a word they assenèrent two strokes of feet which left the dog seriously injured 
our outrage is huge because we do not see this as there are fun to attack free of charge a small animal without defence which was leaves 
add to this the indignation of a woman who was walking calmly and that when she injuria these individuals came to fear for his physical integrity since a énergumène who attack an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman a child or an old man ultimately anyone lower than him 
the episode came to ten seven hours on a tuesday as another in a neighborhood usually quiet 
the dog has gémi all day . 
of course , we have filed complaints to the police station in the neighborhood , even if we doubt that works great thing and not to touch the sensitivities we just want to say that the cowardly killers were spanish 
the indignation has led us to denounce this fact 
we do not understand what is happening among young people for that they are fun to mistreat free a defenceless animal which gives us the affection of friendship and keeps us company 
we do not know where is the good education and respect of animals and people 
michelin and fesvial sets for wearing helmets 
the michelin tyre manufacturer in cooperation with the spanish foundation for road safety fesvial has launched a campaign to encourage wearing helmets mainly among motorcyclists youngsters as have announced today the two structures 
this initiative is intended to raise awareness of the importance of wearing helmets , since it is the only element of protection to avoid head injuries or even death in the event of an accident in two wheels 
michelin has indicated that this campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety that goes beyond the design and manufacture of products always safer and said that it contributed to this goal by other actions to educational and informative 
this new campaign of encouragement to the port of the helmet in two wheels under the motto to be but not to be will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than five hundred garages of motorcycles in order to ensure the widest spread 
finally michelin has stressed that road safety is a constant concern for the company because as tyre manufacturer two-wheeled vehicles one of its main goals is to develop products always safer 
the sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing 
after almost two years the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel 
the nine thousand four hundred and twenty five vehicles registered in november in spain represent an increase of 12 comma six % compared to two thousand eight and what is more important they represent the first increase after twenty two consecutive months of decline , according to the figures from the trade union business sectors of manufacturers anfac and ganvam the dealers 
however , it should be qualify the good news since the reference to the comparison the month of november two thousand eight has been particularly bad with a decrease of 60 % compared to the previous year 
consequently despite the twist last month the registrations accumulated during these eleven months are 40 % below those of the previous year 
since january if we add all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles derived from cars pick up fourgons vans and light trucks lightweight chassis four twenty fifteen thousand eight hundred fifty three have been sold 
the big clouds that affect the more their demand have not provided dispelled indeed although they are also bought by individuals most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized businesses who pay in almost 100 % of cases thanks to an external funding 
as well as more restrictions involved by limiting the bank credits it must add other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation 
faced with this situation , and unlike cars aid to the purchase of the two thousand e have little used 
in addition to individuals , the self-employed and small businesses who want to acquire a commercial vehicle slight of less than three comma five tonnes with a level of emissions of co two which does not exceed the hundred sixty grams per kilometre can also benefit but the number of operations speak of him even 
yesterday among ganvam we recalled again the need for the administration to attach attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles , trucks and buses 
the association of dealers provides a year two thousand ten similar to that which ends to which it calculates a drop in sales of cars and four four of ten nine % 
the emergency braking is now obligatory 
as has occurred with the system anti-lock brakes abs and , as this will take place with the esp stability control the braking systems of emergency will be a mandatory part on european cars 
they are already mandatory in cars of tourism and light commercial vehicles while newly registered for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been set until the end of february two thousand eleven 
the measure imposed by the european union aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians , even if by his mode of action , it can also help prevent many rear shocks 
the assistant emergency braking is increasing the pressure on the brakes in emergency cases detected by the system through kicked given by the driver 
but it does not always keeps the pressure until the end 
according to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars bosch one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to rely on the brake before the collision and half of them had not benefited from its full force 
up to 1 cent accidents 
the intervention of the aid in revancha requires the most of the brake system , reducing the distance that the car needs to stop 
according to a study from the eu if all cars were equipped with this type of elements until thousand cent fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be prevented each year 
this reduction would be even more important with popularizing of the so-called intelligent systems emergency braking we calculate that a sinister on four with injuries would be avoided 
in this case the vehicle is equipped with a system that thanks to a radar or a camera detects the obstacles and warns the driver in addition to act on the brakes slightly 
if the driver reacts it aid by increasing the pressure on the pedal if necessary 
if it does not act , and although the collision is inevitable the device is the maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimise the damage 
general motors postponed until january the plan for opel 
while workers of the opel plant in zaragoza figueruelas have been warned by nick reilly the new president of general motors gm europe that the production of the new meriva model would be launched during the first week of april probably the eight after javier ortega the north american manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the rescue of opel 
nick reilly the new president of gm europe meant that every point of the plan has been approved in advance by the relevant part 
and this can mean that the final document which will first be subjected to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories to be postponed until beginning two thousand ten 
however in gm it ensures that a decision on the sale of saab should be taken in the next few days 
yet a crucial step for the balkans 
since the world is focused on iraq , north korea and a possible crisis with iran on the issue of nuclear weapons kosovo happening a little unnoticed 
the public will soon have the opportunity to again turn its attention to this province during a decision on his fate 
the united states and their european friends have repeatedly announced their intention to take before the end of the year the difficult decision to separate or not kosovo from serbia 
this crucial decision for the future of an unstable region will test the determination and western unity 
the talks this year in vienna orchestrated by the united nations have shown that an agreement between serbia and kosovo on a final status will not see the day 
negotiations are continuing , but as with much tact the negotiator of the un and former finnish president martti ahtisaari on the security council they died in the facts 
no serbian leader will not accept the independence of kosovo , because nationalism remains the dominant political force in the country 
indeed the prime minister vojislav kostunica apostle of serbian nationalism has tried by all means to undermine the interim government of kosovo 
it is eager to hold a national referendum this month on a new constitution without parliamentary debate serious or the usual education of the public 
the main goal of this new constitution takes in his preamble that maintains the kosovo in its status of inalienable part of serbia 
the kosovo albanians have said that they will not accept no link with serbia for tiny that it is 
throughout the years thousand nine hundred four twenty ten they are practically out of kosovo managed by the serbs by creating parallel institutions 
their mass exodus of forced to thousand nine hundred four twenty ten nine and nato intervention which followed putting an end to the reign of serbia and establishing a virtual state under the aegis of the un has made intolerable any other solution than independence 
in one or two months the contact group of the balkans is the united states the united kingdom , france , germany , italy and russia will consider the recommendations of ahtisaari on the final status of kosovo and will propose can be a solution to the security council who should take the final decision 
in public , all the members of the contact group tried to leave the issue the final status of kosovo open but in private the united states and some of his allies have said the two parties that they would propose the independence this year 
some members of the security council including russia and china take a dim view or remain sceptical about a solution imposed , and few governments are for the division of the territory of another country compelling person circumstances 
the choice of the security council to approve the independence depends largely on the possibility of preventing a russian veto which will require considerable diplomatic efforts 
the nature of the independence granted also has its importance 
the independent kosovo must be able to live in safety and its minorities must be protected 
the north of kosovo today largely under the control of belgrade must not be partitioned of fact while the name not 
in order to reduce the blow to serbia must be that the security council avoids grant independence so distorted that the new state cannot really work 
if the security council fails to take a decision on a final status it will cause a critical situation kosovo will declare independence unilaterally and all nations must decide not to recognise the new state 
if that happens it is very likely that the serbs in the north of kosovo will declare their own independence 
at a minimum serbia will strongly campaign against any recognition 
in fact the government of serbia are already trying to convince the west to delay the decision until e two thousand seven 
he says that if kosovo independent becomes the ultra-nationalist radical party will be there again to power the next elections and believes that hold elections as early as this year will spur the contact group to postpone its proposal in the security council 
in addition the government has encouraged the leaders of the republika srpska from bosnia to threaten to organise their own referendum on the separation of a bosnia still fragile 
and they continue to grow in vain for the referral of ahtisaari in order to extend the discussions in vienna 
the timing of the organisation of the constitutional referendum appears to be part of this strategy dilatory 
some hope that a postponement will stimulate violence in kosovo and pushes the west to reconsider the independence of kosovo 
this tactic may be working 
many eu countries are concerned about the implications of the withdrawal of territory of a country as well as the impact of the independence of kosovo on serbian democracy 
given the political instability of serbia they doubt the damage that would cause a postponement in the short term that would be mainly auto inflicted 
but postpone the decision would only allow kostunica to find new ways to make it even more difficult a decision by the security council 
the west must ignore the siren song of belgrade 
serbian politics will be chaotic and unstable in the near future and serbian politicians will try to use this situation as an excuse to avoid facing up to the loss of kosovo 
in the same way to establish links between serbia and kosovo whatever the circumstances will be problematic 
but a failure to make a decision today permanently on the final status of kosovo will produce a worse situation in the balkans will hamper the progress of serbia towards the west and its accession to the eu will condemn ethnic minorities in kosovo to a dangerous ambiguity and will undermine fragile states such as bosnia and macedonia 
the only realistic solution for kosovo is independence 
if serbia wants to join the west it must not abandon this opportunity in fall for his nationalist past 
dawn new and dangerous for south korea 
the decision to north korea to expel the inspectors in atomic energy of the united nations is one more reason to look at the election of roh moo hyun to the presidency of south korea two weeks earlier as a historic tidal waves 
the beginning of his term coincides not just with one of the most dangerous episodes of the korean peninsula for decades but his presidency will also be the witness to a test of relations between the united states and south korea to a degree ever achieved by the past 
the victory of roh on lee hoi chang shows a change of generation in the korean policy with a youth determined to win a freedom of movement in its relations with the united states 
in fact the differences of generation were the decisive factor in the race for the presidential election replacing the regional feelings dominèrent each race for the presidency before this one 
according to a report more than 60 % of the population of the twenty to thirty years voted roh creating a gap of two comma three % in this race for the presidency where were found for the first time in 30 years two men face to face fighting shoulder-to-shoulder 
the position populist nationalist and roh will be quickly and sorely tested by reality when he will take his post in february 
but one that combines the generational change that brought to power with a strong popular will continue with the commitments taken toward the north korea beyond the fact that north korea continues to strengthen itself on the nuclear plan and the recipe is complete in a dispute with the united states 
roh a self-taught legal who succeeds the examination of the bar without ever go to university and doing its right has managed to convince the electorate that it would open a new era in politics that better reflects a south korea enriched and whose middle class has strengthened overturning the political games dominated by insiders disputes regional and the struggles of factions 
his style and his rhetoric pushed for the image news for korea of a man of the people involved in the elimination of networks of favoritism and corruption sclerotic 
for the first time in modern history of korea the presidential campaign has really been the place of debates on the central issues facing the country must face rather than focusing on the parties and personalities 
the candidate roh has called for new relations between south korea and the united states based on the principle of independence and equality 
and he announced no longer want to be an extension of the united states nor wanting to travel to washington to take just the traditional picture he also promised to continue the policy of president kim dae jung called the policy of ray of sunshine in its engagement with the north 
it is remarkable that roh has won the election despite the north korean decision to reactivate its nuclear reactors arrested since thousand nine hundred four twenty fourteen 
a few years earlier , such a gesture would have condemned the candidacy of roh 
that it has surpassed this obstacle without a change of position on the commitment to north korea demonstrates that times have changed radically 
the popular envy pressing for change rather than a comfortable situation now becomes the main concern of any average korean 
the election campaign roh has also benefited from a growing trend in the anti américanisme 
the acquittal by an american military tribunal of two american soldiers who killed accidentally aboard their armored vehicle two korean schoolgirls in june sparked off of the street demonstrations across the country 
although president george w bush has apologized to two times for the deaths of two small girls the requirements continued to accumulate to amend the agreement on the status of the armed forces status of force sofa agreement that governs the legal treatment reserved for american troops stationed in south korea 
the koreans insist that the american soldiers who commit crimes should be judged by the courts koreans 
this expression of national pride injured was possible after the extraordinary performance of the south korean team at the football world cup last summer which helped convince the koreans to full maturity of their countries , and this fact can now defend themselves without the presence of thirty seven thousand american soldiers 
in fact many koreans who see now the american presence and not the communist regime in north korea as the biggest obstacle to the unification 
according to a recent poll only fifty four comma eight % of koreans still support the maintenance of american troops in the country while 30 and a comma seven % oppose it 
these feelings will form part of the test of diplomacy which will give its forms to the presidency of roh since its inception as it needs to rethink the relations between korea and the united states at the same time as the bush administration is agitated about north korea 's nuclear ambitions and its role in the spread of weapons of mass destruction in rogue states 
for the moment the korean voters apparently insensitive to threats presented by the north korea 's nuclear weapons support the policy of roh for the maintenance of dialogue and trade with the north 
under the presidency of roh the internal politics of south korea and its relations with the united states and north korea will require an almost total nine 
it can 't stay on the verge of maintaining security in the peninsula while remaining committed to america and with the support of his electorate 
reconciling these targets would be a difficult test for even the most experienced politician and the most cynical then from there to know if president roh can succeed is the divination 
any failure , however , means the prospects so horrific that nobody can really wish him 
each his path to peace 
over the next three weeks , the israeli army will do something unprecedented instead of defending the country against external enemies or terrorists it will evacuate by force if necessary nine thousand israelis from their homes 
the unilateral withdrawal of israel is the culmination of a deep political change caused by two convictions somewhat contradictory that have characterised the policies of prime minister ariel sharon for two thousand three first that the roadmap initially launched by the united states is going nowhere and then that the status quo is untenable 
for sharon there is no doubt that the nine thousand jewish settlers living among a comma two million palestinians in the gaza strip is no future 
therefore because negotiations a unilateral withdrawal is the only sensible approach to the reduction of violence and stabilisation 
this policy has deeply divided israel the settlers for most but not all religious feel betrayed by sharon the father of the settlements 
today is the israeli left that although against heart realizes that the new pragmatism preached by sharon is can be the first step in the right direction 
just as de gaulle in algeria sharon has distributed the maps of the israeli policy 
these last few weeks have been the framework of massive demonstrations some violence nearing the number of settlers have declared that they do not follow the evacuation orders 
the army and the police have mobilized almost fifty thousand troops to carry out evictions 
this approach by force is traumatic not only for the settlers but also for many other israelis 
the next few days and weeks can only tell us if the evacuation happens peacefully or not 
in the meantime sharon has paid dearly for its policy 
right-wing parties have left the coalition to power it has lost its majority in his own likud party and his finance minister benjamin netanyahu has left his government 
it is only by inviting the labour party of shimon peres in his cabinet that sharon has managed to retain its parliamentary majority 
the question is , of course , on the situation after the withdrawal from gaza 
initially this withdrawal left many governments sceptical but they ended up do as we say in washington that it was the only thing to do 
among them as among the palestinians some hope that after the withdrawal from gaza , it will be possible to return to the road map and to resume the negotiations which will lead to a final agreement between israel and the palestinians 
it is a huge mistake 
even if it is motivated by the best of intentions hope to revive the road map is not realistic 
future negotiations will have to deal with the issue of final borders between israel and palestine the fate of two hundred thousand jewish settlers in the west bank of the status of jerusalem and the problem of palestinian refugees of a thousand nine hundred and forty seven forty eight 
the chasm between the israeli and palestinian positions on these issues has not diminished since the failed negotiations of camp david two thousand while the fear and lack of trust have been growing 
try to engage in negotiations in such circumstances would be not only a futile exercise but could simply strengthen further remoteness and suspicion in the two camps 
the failure of the annan plan for cyprus suggests that good intentions are not enough and the disagreements in cyprus were miniscule compared to what divides israelis and palestinians 
that is it possible to do 
the only rational way to proceed is probably to recognise that the unilateral moves of each side can further promote the cause of the decline in the violence and the final reconciliation 
on the israeli side other withdrawals of dozens of small isolated settlements in the west bank , forcing the evacuation of twenty thousand to thirty thousand settlers could prove politically feasible and would give the palestinians a contiguous territory in the west bank 
on the palestinian side consolidating control by the palestinian authority of a dozen security services and militias would be an important step 
the palestinian leader abu mazen acknowledges but the question is whether it can 
the palestinian authority could also engage on the difficult path to say the refugees that contrary to what has said 50 years of palestinian propaganda they do not return in israel but will have to settle in the west bank and gaza , areas that will be part of the palestinian state final 
in an ideal world conflicts settle to force of agreements and treaties 
but in real life as the examples of cyprus bosnia and kosovo the stabilisation and the slow decline in violence can sometimes achieve the same goal even without formal agreement 
the lack of plausible alternative one can only hope that this will also be the case for the israelis and the palestinians 
a new world 
berlin as old horses fringants returning the bugle on its military strategists of the cold war feel their rate of adrenalin increase while missile defence is up to the headlines 
admittedly the defence against missiles proposed by bill clinton reluctantly and george w bush with enthusiasm and massively supported by the us congress does not look like the dream of war star done by ronald reagan twenty years ago the missile defence programme nuclear missile defense nuclear american missile defence system is supposed to catch a modest number of warheads and does not a full protection against the missiles enemies 
however the question revives the old debates about deterrence of mutual assured destruction and nuclear arms control and revived the rivalry between the nuclear powers at a time when nuclear weapons have lost much of their raison d 'être 
oddly even though it is not certain that the missile defence programme will lead the debate is in full swing 
and even if the system works it will take between ten and fifteen years can be more before it is operational 
also the words are mounting about something that if there is one day may have little impact 
the governments normally cautious are taking their brands as if the future the expected at the corner of the wood 
how to explain this strange behaviour 
certainly not by a blind faith in technology 
after all the history of missile defence is full of examples of technological disappointments for his supporters that they are part of the government or not 
no sane person cannot assume that what we have never managed before it is to say destroy a small number of warheads in flight will be achieved by a night 
of the three tests which have been carried out so far one has missed some of the other two completely this is why president clinton has preferred to pass the problem to his successor 
if president bush as he mentioned practice now in favour of a new formula it will be even more time to develop the architecture and design a program to test 
and we cannot be sure it will work 
governments are worried at the moment not because of what will be possible or not but about the intentions real or imagined america 
although the americans say loud and clear that the missile defence programme is not directed against anyone that the sole purpose of the united states is to protect their citizens against states such as iraq or north korea almost everybody is convinced the opposite the russians fear that americans do not want to cement their military superiority and the inferiority of russia for always the chinese are afraid that the missile defence programme is a sign of america 's determination that taiwan remains independent europeans fear that the plans of america do not create tensions with russia and between the united states of europe 
because what is important is the political intentions and not technical capabilities it is now that the missile defence programme creates problems he pushes russia to the confrontation makes china nervous and strengthens a european sense of disunity with the united states 
the damage to begin as early as the starting line while the journey remains uncertain 
the political consequences are further enhanced by the fact that 30 years ago the united states and the soviet union have renounced an effective defence against the strategic nuclear missiles 
normally a us defence project to the state of embryo should not cause as much excitement that the missile defence programme 
but the abm treaty of thousand nine hundred sixty twelve banned for an unlimited period the systems designed to protect one or other of these two countries against such nuclear attacks 
given the way the united states proceed with the missile defence programme they will have to violate the treaty is give a notice of six months to denounce what the two signatories are entitled to do if they feel that it is their vital security 
in the eyes of many that would mean that america chooses to abandon the structure of nuclear arms control built during the last part of the cold war 
the bush administration claims that because the cold war is over the formal disappearance of the abm treaty would not endanger the nuclear stability 
but stability is as much a problem of perception policy of technical calculations 
by limiting the strategic anti-missile defence the old treaty offers some assurance of deterrence to the nuclear-armed states 
its disappearance would affect all the other agreements on controls of weapons 
russia threat of all the tear if the united states leave the abm treaty 
even if this threat lack of credibility that would be damaging to the first russian interests , it is based on a certain logic 
the main issue that raises the missile defence programme is not how to prepare for a world of anti-missile defence but how allay fears current policies 
a few attempts are made quietly in the background 
legal experts in washington suggest that moderate preparations for the construction of missile and radar sites do not violate the abm treaty and do not therefore forcing the united states to denounce 
for the moment the bush administration will await the results of tests before taking a decision 
moscow and washington suggest all two that a deep reduction of their offensive nuclear arsenal is possible 
the assurance that the united states will participate in the deliberations makes the sceptics european allies more lenient 
the most important measures designed to gain the confidence a modification of the abm treaty in order to allow a limited anti-missile defence is currently being studied 
the prior niet russia will can be definitive 
and political turmoil in which are dragged russia and europe subsides can be 
but china 
it it is not part of an alliance as europe or a network of arms control treaty with which political solutions can be found , such as russia and it is a factor contributing to the instability of asia and the chinese nervousness 
the trust can only be built on a rapprochement between china and the united states 
unfortunately there is nothing to indicate that washington was not made aware of the gravity of the problem 
the old strategists of the cold war are very disappointed by this 
so that they would review the vocabulary and abbreviations of the royal era of deterrence they discover that he is a world disappeared 
the anti-missile defence threat not strategic stability between the united states and russia but if it is poorly presented it jeopardises the long term political vision 
in announcing its determination to carry out a distant missile defence programme the united states have created a political turmoil which they must deal with now if we want to avoid the most damage 
to avoid a lost generation 
everywhere the young unemployed to the drift are a source of concern 
they are especially a problem in developing countries which have a population explosion increasingly strong the equivalent of 'baby boom' in the west at the end of the second world war 
but the period that followed the war in most developed countries was an era of prosperity without precedent for the generation of the baby boom that is now approaching retirement 
the future is going to t it also be promising for the billion and a few young people aged 12 to 20 four years of developing countries 
these countries should urgently combine investment and political measures to encourage young people to form find work remain healthy start a family and exercise their citizenship 
the benefit is considerable if they succeed accelerated development thanks to the provision of a young population and the reduction in the rate of dependency 
in east asia this 'dividende démographique' would be at the root of most of the quarter of economic growth in the region 
developing countries have already invested a lot in regard to the younger 
today , they are better educated and better health than previous generations 
more than four vingts % of children go to primary school against 50 % in thousand nine hundred seventy , and infant mortality has fallen from more than 10 % to six comma five % during the same period 
but governments must not just invest in favour of children they must also begin to deal with the new generation of young people 
yet in countries where the vast majority of children completing primary education few of them have access to secondary 
young people represent half of new cases of hiv infection 
in the middle east and north africa a quarter of young people are without work 
all this raises difficult issues that is which hinders access to secondary education 
is this illiteracy remains high sometimes even at the end of the primary or the lack of resources 
why are there not more young people who know how to protect themselves against aids 
why companies in these countries complain they are often a lack of qualified workforce so that so many students find themselves unemployed at the exit of the university 
an effective policy in the direction of youth is based on three types of measures more possibilities of success offered to young people more skills and the offer of a second chance 
governments must offer more chance of success to young people by improving access and quality health care and education 
it is only in secondary education for pupils to take full advantage of primary education 
yet many young people are still unprepared to secondary school and squares are rare 
employers want today highly skilled workers 
in countries as diverse as algeria bangladesh brazil china estonia or zambia qualifications and inadequate training are barriers hardly franchissables 
if we want to avoid that young people are stuck in jobs without any hope of promotion or simply find themselves without jobs they must be able to enjoy a better education and training that meets the needs of companies 
several countries now trying to facilitate access to secondary education , in particular , thanks to programmes of transferts' contingent , which will distribute benefits to the poor families whose children go to school regularly 
these programmes have enabled us to increase the number of pupils at the secondary school in mexico in ecuador in bangladesh and cambodia 
but for these programmes have a use for the pupils have the skills needed to enter secondary school 
in morocco , for example , more than four vingts % of children are doing a first round of education but less than 20 % reach the required level 
the measures are also necessary to help young people make good decisions 
a government cannot replace the parents or the community , but it can encourage young people and their families to take charge 
with the information it needed a stimulus and the young will be better equipped to take decisions about their health or their future 
in cameroon intended for young cities a programme about the sexual hygiene horizon young people has helped to increase their knowledge of the matter and changing their behavior and the rate of young women of the use of condoms is past fifty eight 60 % to 16 % in the group who has followed the programme 
another example in the dominican republic the rate of inclusion in the high schools has increased when the pupils have been informed of the amount of wages of those who had reached the end of their secondary education an amount that they had largely under estimated 
in bangladesh the project of assistance to the female secondary school has helped financially girls aged 11 to 14 years to continue their studies and delaying the time of marriage 
governments should also offer a 'deuxième chance' to young people who have failed because of the circumstances or bad choice 
the corresponding programmes must be well designed properly targeted and coordinated way to provide adequate encouraging its beneficiaries 
as well as sub saharan africa thousands of young combatants hundred thousand in sudan alone who hope to reconstruct their lives in peace time but they have obviously need a training and a job as well as medical and psychological support 
with the political will of the measures based on the efforts of young people themselves to increase their chances of success and their skills and the offer of a second chance to those in need these countries could maximize their demographic advantage 
they can seize this opportunity for growth to improve their prospects of developing either take the risk of a lost generation aigrie by the lack of future 
the european paternalism 
the italian presidency of the european union is a huge responsibility that reinvigorate enlargement as key aspect of the new eu 
the best place to start would be to encourage a better attitude towards the adoption of the euro for countries acceding to the union 
in fact the paternalistic position of eu institutions to the accession countries threatens to create a two-speed europe that complicate the process of integration 
the accession countries have taken their share of the market in achieving the commercial integration with the countries of the union sometimes stronger than in many member countries 
three of them estonia , latvia and lithuania have currency boards or a fixed exchange rate with the euro as bulgaria which must join the union in two thousand seven 
the others have shown for several years their interest to adopt the euro at the start of unilaterally in some cases even before entry into the eu a position openly supported by the national bank of poland , and to a lesser degree by the national bank of hungary and the national bank of the czech republic 
yet despite their progress to bring their rate of inflation and interest rates closer to european levels many candidate countries fear with the full opening capital movements prerequisite for accession to the eu to expose themselves to the risk of rulings brutal capital flows and crises cambiaires 
they have learned the lessons of latin america and asia in the years thousand nine hundred four twenty ten 
the adoption of the euro would enable them very easily to escape to such risks and focus their efforts on the creation of real growth for their economies 
however the response of european institutions and especially the european central bank and the european commission was negative the applicant countries entendirent argued that they must first spend two years in the european exchange rate mechanism erm two where aspiring to the euro had to prove what were able their policies 
at the beginning even systems board were considered unacceptable although as is often the case in europe of exceptions have been made the country with the systems board could keep them even after their accession to the eu 
the opposition of the ecb and the commission for an early adoption of the euro is ill-informed 
what should count for the european union remains that the policies of any member state are not harmful to the other member states 
as the pointed out leszek balcerowicz the governor of the national bank of poland the adoption of the euro by the candidate countries creates certainly benefits for the candidate countries while being in the worst case entirely without effect for the current members 
indeed the combined economic weight of all the candidates is far too low only six percent of the gdp of the enlarged eu to exercise any effect on the euro 
however the opposition continues the institutions of the eu has led most of the candidates to abandon the idea to adopt the euro unilaterally , or as soon as possible after their entry into the union 
unfortunately the stubbornness of the ecb and the commission now provide grist to the mill of the populist governments in countries homebuyers who rely on the variation of exchange rates to escape fiscal discipline that involves the adoption of the euro 
however such manoeuvres disqualifieraient tax probably a country wishing to enter quickly in the euro zone 
in fact the accession countries that have not put in place a system board have seen their budget deficits surge exceeding nine % of gdp in hungary in two thousand two , and more than 5 % in poland in the czech republic and slovakia while large capital inflows have been putting pressure on their currencies to climb 
this trend exposes the real economies of candidate countries to the risk of a reversal of capital flows and crises cambiaires that early adoption of the euro would eliminate 
ironically the candidate countries are lecture by officials from the ecb and the commission on the compromise between nominal convergence and real convergence 
it would seem that the only imperative to brussels is the growth target of candidate countries macroeconomic stability can wait 
large budget deficits to support growth and inflation is not apparently a problem 
if this line of reasoning seems familiar it may be good because it takes on more or less the foundations of the planning system is not sustainable by which the accession of candidate countries was suspended in the early years thousand nine hundred four twenty ten 
this was , of course , the adoption of economic policies focused on market forces in the former communist countries who brought the doors of eu membership 
as the european institutions should drop their approach paternalistic and take seriously the concerns of the central banks of candidate countries about the risks related to the maintenance of their own currency over a long period during which their economy should open up completely capital movements 
today the ecb and the european commission support de facto the positions of the populist governments from eastern europe who already spend funds that they hope to achieve in the future of the eu 
it is high time that the european institutions address of more serious way the challenges and opportunities that present enlargement 
they could start by considering the early adoption of the euro by the candidate countries a more favourable look as well for countries with a cash system than for those using a floating rate 
the european disaster of blair 
when french and dutch voters rejected the proposed european union constitution everyone has quickly understood that the european project was in a difficult situation 
the painful battle of last week on the future in the medium term of the budget of the union still has more confirmed this verdict 
it has also sadly put an end to the british presidency of the european council in pointing out that britain continues to maintain its old reputation of exception in the european union 
the two facts are intimately linked 
in france and the netherlands voters have not explained why they voted against the draft constitution 
but many commentators have believed that this vote expressed their protest against the admission perceived as precipitated the ten new member states and especially the poorest countries of central and eastern europe 
more particularly , it would appear that the voters have been afraid of losing their jobs at the expense of crowds of migrants from this fear has been widely illustrated this period by the image of the polish plumber cheap 
the irony , of course , lies in the fact that most of the 15 old member states have refused to new countries entrants complete and immediate access to markets in the western employment 
in any case it was too late to protest since the ten countries were indeed become full members of the union 
but now the twenty five member states must face the economic consequences of this enlargement not only on the question of the overall size of the european budget for the next seven years , but also on the distribution of contributing countries and beneficiaries 
the key question is how the old member states are willing to pay to boost the economies late new member countries 
in fact the battle took place on three fronts and has opposed the uk , france and the new member states 
traditionally a large majority of the budget amounted to agriculture and the lagging regions 
in practice huge amounts of money have been attributed to the big agricultural producers is the poorest member states such as greece and portugal 
these two levels the new member states expected to benefit substantially the eu system 
once in budgetary terms the loser of the european mechanisms was the united kingdom to the time when two-thirds of eu expenditure amounted to agriculture its agricultural sector was weak and therefore the british have little benefited european agricultural subsidies 
for a long time they complained about the injustice of these rules , especially at this time the united kingdom was one of the poorest member states it is in a thousand nine hundred four twenty four that the conservative government of margaret thatcher demanded and got a massive rebate on the british net contribution to the eu budget 
today , the situation has changed in three key points firstly the reform of european agricultural policy has begun and the proportion of european agricultural budget has fallen 60 to 40 % 
then it is many years that britain has a faster economic growth that most of the other member states so that it has become one of the richest countries in the eu and that in comparison with france and germany to finish the new member states are so poorer than the poorest of the old member states that they have a moral argument weight to ask for a share of the budget negotiated generous whatever 
the start of negotiations , six months ago coincides with the start of the british presidency of the european council 
the british prime minister tony blair has galvanized politicians by declaring before the european parliament in brussels that it was passionately european pro 
that was the message that the british pro europeans had hoped for a long time and that they expected in vain since the election of blair in thousand nine hundred four twenty ten seven 
of course he has never expressed such a feeling within britain over the past eight years 
in addition , since britain has been one of the strongest advocates of enlargement to the countries of central and eastern europe we would have expected in the budget negotiations the government of blair is proportionately so generous that excited to new entrants 
initially it seemed to be the tactics adopted by the british government 
but against all odds it has adopted a position ethically advantageous in proposing to give up part of his budget rebate only on condition that the rest of the european union and france in particular agrees about the fundamental reforms in terms of european agricultural policy 
it took time for the british understand that since president jacques chirac was a beleaguered president unsound and remaining at the elysée until two thousand seven but without owning no power it did not have the resources to endorse such a bargaining 
once the british have become aware of this harsh reality they have played their lamentable last card in the management of the negotiations they have made offers petty and ridiculous all mainly designed to safeguard the small british interests and this mainly at the expense of the new member states 
what sad conclusion for a presidency opened with great fanfare six months by the statements passionately european pro tony blair 
the full text of his speech is unambiguous 
blair is in favour of europe but not at this one 
he wants to be part of a political europe but only if the other member states agree to follow the model of economic and social reform british 
the problem is that economic and social reform is purely and simply a matter of national policy and is not part of the union 's powers if such a reform was to have taken place in france or germany this issue would be exclusively discussed between the politicians and the french or german voters 
it could only be included in the powers of the union on condition that the eu will become a true federation 
can we say blair that it is then federalist 
of course not 
it is above all a nationalist reckless who lives in fear of the furtive tabloïde press his country 
so why does it therefore declared its fervour european pro 
can be did t it ultimately not considered the matter 
europe the challenge of neoliberalism 
for over twenty years i argued that the high rate of unemployment of western europe could not persist 
at the end of the ' thousand nine hundred seventy monetarists bet that only a transitory and modest increase in unemployment could contain the rampant inflation and open to the industrial west and that the cost of a return to effective price stability would have been worth 
in britain and the united states this bet monetarist has had a happy ending 
not in western europe 
in the twenty five years european unemployment has risen to measure that monetary policy is tended and that interest rates were increased to fight inflation 
but when inflation has succumbed unemployment has not fallen or almost no 
if the rate of unemployment has not reached the levels of the great depression it remained high enough to make the long-term unemployment or the fear of unemployment in the long term a shocking experience 
the governments of the companies in which the official unemployment rate remains at 10 % or more for several generations have poor economic management 
as a result it seemed to me for 20 years that the balance under jacent politics in western europe collective bargaining and ample social insurance on one side and tight monetary policies of the other was condemned to creak 
european policymakers seem paralysed by a double fear 
central bankers europe fear that their political masters their command to relax monetary policy the structural reforms needed to unlock the aggregate offers are not granted and that the result is a return to inflation years thousand nine hundred seventy 
in short they fear that all the sacrifices made to stabilise prices have been in vain 
the politicians of western europe for their part fear the opposite effect 
they worry that even after structural reforms aimed at reducing the attractiveness of unemployment insurance and motivate workers so that they are going to businesses and companies to the workers central bankers will continue to insist to tighten the purse-strings 
in short they fear that without increasing the production or employment the net effect is not simply that an increase in poverty 
of course these fears are accompanied by the hope that the structural reforms and monetary expansion work in harmony caused a boom in employment and production without causing substantial increase inflation 
but the reality is that no step towards the loosening of monetary policies have been put in place above all with the european central bank débutante anxious to establish its credibility in the fight against inflation and that attempts to structural reforms are hesitant and small 
i am led astray for 20 years the systems of western europe have remained stable despite the exclusion of a large proportion of citizens of a real involvement in economic life 
the growth of the economies of the countries of western europe has continued despite the heavy burden of the 10 % of unemployed but not as quickly as it would have been 
today it seems that i finally have reason if it is not to panic at least worrying 
the french have rejected the european constitution , above all , at least according to appearances because greater european integration feared it would result in its wake the enormous costs and the disruption of neoliberalism 
it is one thing to support the european project when it comes to link germany and france so closely that nobody thinks useful to make war to determine what language should be spoken in alsace lorraine 
it is another when the european project means that the french workers will face competition from polish plumbers of romanian farmers and sellers turks 
in germany the voters seem to evict chancellor gerhard schroeder because his allegiance lukewarm to the neo-liberal project their dislike 
the problem is that they may find themselves governed for four years by a chancellor angela merkel almost as attached to the neo-liberal project that me 
i believe that germany would do better in ten years with more neoliberal policies 
but that does not appear to match the desire of the german electorate which makes absolutely unpredictable the aspect of german politics by four years 
moreover , the discontent of northern europe towards the central bankers , particularly of the ecb and the euro 
not that the end of the european monetary union to be decided but it is simply that some have begun to consider a dark future where the end of emu would be put on the agenda 
which is enough to rattle the prices of assets around the world 
the successes of western europe since the second world war are among the most impressive and the more encouraging success of the history of the world 
everyone should hope that united europe today build on these successes rather than see generations of high rates of unemployment put them in danger 
the attitude of the ecb will have to change 
europe needs a monetary policy given that the unemployment rate fell in northern europe is more important than the price stability of the continent 
the south and east of europe will suffer inflation this essential because regions develop and industrialize the terms of the exchange are improving and under the auspices of a monetary union regional inflation may be a step to cross 
the ecb should not try to balance inflation in the south and east with deflation of the north for artificial reaching targets across the entire continent 
rescued by taxes 
what are we owe our back back back small children 
what measures should we take today to reduce the risks posed to our descendants and to our planet by the increasing likelihood of global warming and climate change 
almost everyone except exxon mobil of vice president dick cheney of their paid servants and deluded acolytes understands that when humans burn hydrocarbons carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere where it acts like a giant coverage which absorbs the infrared radiation emitted by underneath warming the planet 
similarly almost everyone understands that the warming of the planet could be more serious is less serious than the existing models suggest but that this uncertainty is not an excuse for doing nothing 
in fact it should prompt us to better protect ourselves if we knew that global warming will be exactly according to the projections medium-sized 
finally almost everyone agrees that the governments the non-profit institutions and oil companies should spend much more money for research on energy technologies without emitting carbon or able to remove the pollutants from the atmosphere and oceans and so cool the planet by sending more solar radiation 
it is clear that the rich who must bear the burden of solving the problem of climate change over the next few generations 
after all they were able to access industrialisation and wealth by polluting blithely 
today china , india and other developing countries do not have this latitude and it would be unfair to penalize 
it is now time to build not to dismantle or undermine the international institutions which will have to manage our response to climate change in the coming years 
but do we need to do something else now , and over the next decade 
economists like to think in terms of cost 
and when they see a behavior having destructive side effects they like the tax 
the tax is forcing people to feel the damage they cause where it hurts the door currency 
impose a tax on those who drive four of four in the city for example is a way to encourage collective intelligence to decide that the adverse side effects are a good reason to change its behavior 
but it must be a tax just 
a four four which passes through ten seven miles into town and which consumes three comma seven litres of petrol rejected almost three kilos carbon in the atmosphere 
the tax greenhouse effect must it be zero zero comma ten euro to zero comma thirty eight euro or a comma 15 euro per litre 
this choice will be determined by what we learn over the years , but today the amount of the tax is more a matter of philosophical how many believe we duty to our distant descendants 
the australian economist john quiggin has an illuminating discussion on his website 
on the other hand critics point out that the world today is poor average annual gdp per capita in purchasing power parity stands at five thousand five hundred euro around 
one expects that the improvement of technologies and their spread to make the world a much richer in two thousand cent with annual growth of two % it will be almost forty thousand euro per head in terms of purchasing power two thousand six 
these critics believe so we have a lot more need today this marginal expenditure fifty five euro that individuals richest two thousand cent will need four euro cents that they would win by being protected from the effects of climate change 
but what the critics often fail to mention is that the same logic applies to the world 
average annual per capita incomes are currently around thirty thousand six hundred euro in the united states in japan and western europe and less than four thousand six hundred euro for the poorer half of the globe 
the same logic that we need more than fifty five euro today that people two thousand cent will need four hundred additional euro wants the rich should be taxed more to the extent where every three hundred vingts euro four additional taxes in rich countries are reflected by an increase in income per head of fifty five euro in poor countries 
in other words , if the rich are miserly today for our descendants more rich and if we decide to allow them to cope with an ecological disaster we must now be generous with the poor of this world 
conversely , if we are greedy , today to the poor we need to be generous with our descendants 
at least that is what we should do if our actions are based more on moral principles on the leitmotif of leonid brezhnev 's what we have taken we keep 
take pharmacovigilance seriously 
the health threats nuclear reactors firearms and contaminated foods threaten all of us that is why the governments are playing an active role in the limit through regulations often successful 
yet the situation is very different when it comes to the safety of prescription drugs 
in fact for the regulator pharmacovigilance is the poor relation of the public protection 
the scope of the problem is enormous 
nothing that in the united states it is estimated that every year the side effects are responsible for the death of a hundred thousand patients 
if these figures are proved this means that the deaths caused by drugs rank fourth or fifth leading cause of death , according to estimates on mortality used 
in addition the direct annual hospital costs due to adverse effects will run into billions of dollars and all this without mentioning the suffering caused by the secondary effects that do not lead to hospitalization or death 
the difficulties to determine the causes and effects should be taken into account 
it is sometimes difficult to know whether the death or hospitalization of a patient is attributable to a particular drug to disease treated or to the association of two 
this phenomenon is that stress the need to ensure the safety of medicines 
the fact that all drugs in addition to their profits produce undesirable effects among some patients is one of the reasons to be pharmacovigilance 
there is a need to weigh carefully the beneficial effects and unwanted medicines before the approved and use 
these judgments vary according to whether they are issued by a pharmaceutical company , which expects the benefits of its sales or by a patient who could suffer a serious side effect 
the incompleteness of knowledge complicating this estimate 
the rush to put new drugs on the market often leads to an incomplete research on their safety 
more than half of medicines approved causes a serious side effect unknown at the time of its marketing authorisation 
an example when the new class of painkillers called parp cox two was put on the market regulators doctors and patients ignored that these drugs could cause heart attacks and strokes 
tens of thousands of innocent patients can be more have suffered from those side effects before the withdrawal of the first two drugs in this class 
it is difficult to provide a complete list and appropriate the harmful effects of medicines 
the rate of spontaneous alerts to the regulatory agencies is low around a % and the controls are passive in many countries 
it must also rely on the general reluctance to report the side-effects of medicines 
doctors sometimes feel guilty and fear the trial and pharmaceutical companies worry about threats to their profits the regulatory agencies about they must confront the question why this drug has not been allowed 
it is particularly difficult to allocate an undesirable effect to a drug when the symptom is common in the age group the user or the disease treated 
as the risk of heart attacks is important in the elderly , many of whom suffer from pain related to arthritis treatments , requiring painkillers it took six years to make the link between parp cox two and multiplication by two or three of the risks of heart attacks 
a recent survey harris survey in the united states concluded that 60 % of adults are either not convinced everything is not very convinced that drug makers to disclose information about the adverse effects of their products 
this scepticism is justified internal documents obtained during recent trials show that pharmaceutical companies often declined to submit information criticism in terms of security to the regulatory agencies as the law and fail to communicate this information to doctors and patients 
one of the problems is that the consequences of this neglect of the harmful effects of medicines are either non-existent or minimal 
it is time to be serious 
citizens and governments must make pharmacovigilance a priority and commit resources needed to solve the problem 
the penalties for pharmaceutical companies that fails to point out and communicate the information on the safety of their medicines should be increased significantly to an effective deterrent 
the agencies must have the resources to enforce the laws for stricter rules are implemented 
the problem of pharmacovigilance must be seen as a failure of the system 
it is not fair to blame the serious adverse effects physicians , particularly in the absence of comprehensive information on the safety of medicines 
the full cooperation of doctors is essential to solve the problem but it means that we must put an end to their fear of becoming the tribunal 
this approach works well in the aviation industry pilots reporting the mistakes they have threatened to make are not penalised 
patients must be better informed about the risks of drugs they are prescribed on prescription and more involved in their detection and their reporting 
the instructions printed in tiny letters are unnecessary 
the control undesirable effects should be more proactive 
this request more funding should come from the main beneficiaries of the sale of drugs the pharmaceutical industry in the same way that the monitoring of air safety is funded by the airlines 
above all improving pharmacovigilance will depend on if we want the efforts to reach the establishment of an independent office intended to promote coordinate and give indications of the programme of regulation 
that office is in the united kingdom 
other governments should follow this model in order to fulfil their role neglected so far of guardian of public health 
the virtual enemy 
five years have passed since the terrorist attacks of september two thousand one on new york and washington and yet it seems that the decision-makers have hardly learned about the workings of the terrorist cells and their weaknesses 
the bush administration always use the expression war against terrorism and behaves as if it was really a war of usual type when a government in fight another 
yet after five years of military efforts strategies based on the targeting of a single opponent have only made the situation worse 
it is time to understand the new model of conflict emerging 
for the paradigm war works the bush administration referred to al qaeda as a precise enemy 
in reality there is no great organiser or financing terrorist activities 
the bali attacks in madrid and london as well as several attempts uncovered in the united states and britain were all characterised by their organisation dispersed 
it is plots generated independently who have used the ad hoc resources often inside the target country 
these small operations also lacked a scheme common internal 
the terrorist motivations differ from cell to cell even from person to person 
individuals can be motivated by profit or the thirst for power or for political reasons and religious , while other act by hatred or for the great thrill 
in addition there are big differences in terms of the risk of rewards and imperatives as you climb the chain organisational or that you move from one cell to another 
the conventional military models are equipped to decapitate a thing that in this case has no head 
the characteristics of this new structure have already been studied in a very different context 
terrorism is the violent version of a virtual company agile 
a virtual company is a small group who together all alone in organisation just large enough to implement a collective intention 
the virtual companies are unusually innovative , and in the business sector they are without doubt the only system capable of creating a single product effectively 
the industry of film production is a glaring example 
in fact it is without doubt the business model of the future 
the benefits virtual businesses from their lightness in terms of stability 
at the moment the greater part of the price of a product finance the enormous and ineffective organisation which has assembled 
almost all the creativity and the resolution of problems are happening in small businesses and are integrated later by large companies whose infrastructure is expensive and fragile and that retains most of the profits 
this model is the basis of the business world today as the centralisation in has been the strategy of privileged defence 
when you buy a car to general motors four vingts cents of every dollar spent back to gm who manages almost only 
small suppliers provide you actually four vingts % of the value and innovation but only receive 20 % of the reward 
ironically the in-depth research on alternative models have been funded by the us department of defence which as the biggest buyer of complex machinery of the world wanted better quality goods less expensive and more on measure 
the research found the conditions and the trigger mechanisms necessary to facilitate the constitution autonomous small groups opportunistic and to allow them to behave as large companies 
unfortunately the research programme has been cancelled before its findings may not apply to the business world surely because it threatened to large companies 
it is often forgotten that defense secretary donald rumsfeld has abandoned a comfortable retirement to reorganise the us army in a force smaller and more agile using some of these same ideas 
but the organisation of the invasion of iraq where rumsfeld had recommended the use of fewer troops than expected shows a poor understanding of the systems distributed 
while the troops were deployed in the aim of an entry and a withdrawal flexible the bush administration ends up using them for an occupation to the former 
the terrorists have shown a talent greatest to capitalize on the models of operations distributed 
the crowds of texts appear in the muslim world on the strategic studies of jihad 
the most famous in the west is the management of savagery the management of the brutality but only because it was translated and made public 
these books and trends indicate that they become less dogmatic and increasingly complex in terms of adoption modern techniques of management 
their research include surely the young science of management of the virtual company how feed and support of car cells organised 
the first lesson for western decision makers may be that the virtual companies rely on a culture of trust 
certain kinds of confidence can be based on a concept of artificial not us rather than on real values and direct experience 
it is for this reason that the actions of the bush administration only reinforce the dynamics of the virtual company terrorist 
bush 's rhetoric them and we clearly defines another and positioning as a cohesive enemy 
his approach war is helping islamic terrorists to consider the west as a force as united and malicious 
in the future the model of the virtual company will shape the way will be carried out the cases which will be delivered the wars and probably the way government services will be administered 
it promises to separate the management of the finances of the production involving innovations and faster economic growth 
however if western governments do not develop a deep understanding of how to operate these structures they have no chance to combat terrorist enterprise agile 
the expansion as a solidarity 
these days it is often said that the sense of solidarity of the european union has been put at risk , not to say that he has completely exploded by enlargement to the countries of central and eastern europe 
bulgaria and romania closer to their round of entry into the eu and the negotiations to open up with turkey and croatia it has become essential to question this idea 
the values and interests of the new members of the european union more often coincide with those of the first fifteen states 
it is of course true that enlargement has fundamentally changed the union and given birth to new problems and political questions 
however the new member states in central and eastern europe are deeply integrated into the social and cultural economic development of our continent 
the ties that bind us have been eroded by 40 years of soviet domination but this has not changed fundamentally the european nature of these states 
my country poland has always been profound cultural links with other european countries , particularly france 
we have participated in all the major european developments in terms of music of literature and cinema with , for example , andrzej wajda films of the era 's solidarity such as a french production co danton 
in sport also east europeans are integrated for a long time to the rest of europe 
indeed , before the first world war the german national football team was entirely composed of players to the polish surnames 
but above all there is a deep sense among poles hungarians , and czechs and others who feel all europeans 
what is the real sense of the word solidarity as the dictionary defines the small robert relationship between people with a sense of a community of interest 
solidarity as the sense of a unit resulting from common interests also clearly exists within the 15 members of origin that members of the enlarged union today 
the exceptions prove the rule 
the lack of unity within the european union on the iraq issue should not be overshadowed the agreements that the member states have agreed on all other important issues in terms of international affairs 
for economic issues the disagreements on a single regulation of the european union , for example , should not conceal the fact that no member state new or historical has never contested the community market 
finally the enlargement process itself is obviously a symbol of european unity civil social and cultural 
the fact that it provoked debate and discussion does not contradict the conviction shared by all the old and new member states that they have obligation to rebuild a continent after 40 years of division 
a few questions that remain if they are not fundamental source of division are worrying 
should we fear the fact that europe is no longer today a continent purely judéo christian and white 
the citizens of the european union whose origins are in other continents and whose religion is sikh islamist hindu or buddhist can they identify with the values and culture 
they will be able to feel european as has always been the poles or czechs 
these questions are especially valuable in fact , they cannot be avoided in the case of the possible of turkey 's accession to the european union 
european integration is driven by the respect of the values of others 
is it to share them or contribute 
these are thorny issues 
they are particularly difficult if we consider culture as the cement the future of europe 
all european countries probably thought from the beginning that new entrants not europeans would be treated in the same way that the polish immigrants were involved in the ruhr ten ninth century german 
the fact that this has not occurred at least on a large scale is not to say that this cannot happen 
there is only to see the number of respectable citizens of turkish origin living in germany 
or the large number of britons indians and pakistanis of second generation that we see now in suit tie with laptop to the hand always between two aircraft 
europeans must admit , however , that these individuals only represent a minority 
number of immigrant groups in europe are themselves rejected by their communities the fact of the impossible social and economic integration 
the constant threat of terrorism has made the insulation of islamist populations of europe even more dramatic 
the european union simply cannot declare solidarity as a central value and do nothing to promote among those who feel marginalized 
they must be allowed them to feel this relationship between people with a sense of a community of interest 
european solidarity may not survive this neglect and do not survive 
after kyoto 
the treaty of the kyoto protocol is now come into force for the one hundred and twenty six nations that have signed to this day 
it is now time to begin to speculate on the next point how to bring all the nations including the large emitters to discuss what to do after the treaty expires in two thousand twelve 
that is exactly what has recently made the european commission as he unveiled his first strategy for an era post kyoto which will be examined by the european council in march 
while the kyoto protocol represents only a modest reduction of carbon emissions in industrialized countries five comma two % between two thousand eight and two thousand twelve compared to levels of thousand nine hundred four twenty ten with varying targets the countries real progress can be made in supporting development efforts and preserving our planet 
but first all countries must integrate the climate concerns in the planning of their policies and improve their governance in key sectors such as energy infrastructure and transport 
in other words we must act by being aware that climate change and its effects on the inhabitants of rich and poor countries remain a threat to world security 
in the end the approach on the long term will include probably a system based on rules a system of incentives and investments at the level of technological change 
the adaptation at national level will be increasingly recognised as a major issue which will require adequate funding 
the treatment of the effects of climate change and the treatment of emissions reductions should not exclude one another but be complementary 
consider the world post kyoto gives us the chance to start a new dialogue and to consider the new options on climate change 
the nations could establish a more ambitious goal which would be to limit the change on the long term the temperature of the earth and then to allocate emissions rights between the countries in such a way to limit ultimately temperature increases to an acceptable level 
that would need to increase investment in research and development on energy in order to develop new technologies and best a process that must be supported by more solid partnerships between the public and the private 
so far , with only 15 % of the world population rich countries are responsible for more than sixty 15 % of global emissions of carbon dioxide co two and therefore most of the damage to the environment 
this , however , are developing countries and so the poor countries of the world who are the most vulnerable 
it is unrealistic to ask for poor countries , where more than a comma six billion people do not have access to clean energy and technologies to bear the costs associated with the technological change long-awaited 
in conjunction with its partners , the world bank supports financial strategies designed to help developing countries to settle the costs due to climate change 
has this day more than a billion dollars invested in projects gef global environment facility funds for the global environment and about eight billion dollars placed in the co-financing have been engaged in programmes related to climate change 
while the regulatory mechanisms of kyoto and of the european system of emissions negotiable european trading scheme have contributed to the creation of an emerging market for carbon trade the interested parties are now worried about the immediate future 
without regulatory framework after two thousand twelve new opportunities for commencement of transactions based on projects will end in two thousand six splash two thousand seven 
given the long period between the preparation of the projects , and the first benefits of emissions reductions the project developers have only a few years before them to act before the payments of carbon is continuing to make a significant contribution to the financing of projects in the current context 
the development of projects related to the infrastructure is a long process that requires between three and seven years of the identification through the licensing the financing and the building until the first certification of cuts in carbon emissions 
the projects must therefore be operational at the latest by two thousand seven 
the world bank has contributed to move the financing of carbon as a tool of sustainable development and to facilitate the participation of the private sector in the market 
the bank is focused on the representation of the interests of its borrowers by helping them develop assets for the carbon trade according to their own priorities 
but without commitment of governments to limit emissions of greenhouse gases beyond two thousand twelve the carbon market will remain uncertain and the private sector is essential to the success of the market should not extend its participation a significant and lasting 
according to a recent study supported by the world bank on companies interested in the financing of carbon only a society on five surveyed said that it was interested in emissions cuts after two thousand twelve 
the opportunity arises now to look to the future and mobilise the world community all countries without exception although with different responsibilities in the quest for a safer world a world that would prevent the terrible risks , environmental degradation and social conflict involved by inaction 
state of the art or art of the state 
september is traditionally the month when the orchestras and opera companies leave the festivals of aachen salzburg tanglewood and many other home 
this session is also marked on both sides of the atlantic by the return of concerns about the means of financing classical music 
life american symphony is eurocentriste under almost all its aspects except for its funding 
while the americans rely on private donations tax deductible and revenue to finance displays of classical music europeans prefer a direct government support 
ironically , while the defenders of the arts in the united states have long called for the adoption of the european model , which has produced a rich and varied life artistic europe is forced to change course and to guide its system of support towards greater dependence toward private money and revenue 
unfortunately the european system of direct government funding is a victim of european economic growth slow and budget deficits 
the problem is especially for those countries that have adopted the euro since public spending in the arts will be limited during a time by the obligation to keep the deficit below 3 % of gdp 
the pressure on the european institutions performing arts causes concern at several levels 
traditionally the european social democracies prefer to distribute goods and services rare as concerts and operas to a system of queues financed by huge subsidies to keep low prices rather than by the willingness of each to pay 
this will now change 
the defenders of performing arts in europe point the finger at the united states where between other even major conductors must participate actively in research funding and play an active role in the local community on behalf of the orchestra 
they fear that the same thing erupted in europe 
some conductors refusing to handle the bowl at the same time as the stick refused important posts in the united states for this reason feeling that it would thwart their art 
it is said that daniel barenboim has left the chicago symphony orchestra in part because he objected to the fundraising demands expected of him 
but experience shows that north american use of big names in the field of art as the heads of orchestra to participate in the collection of funds does not necessarily in the artistic aspect of the job 
michael tilson thomas to san francisco for example has combined collection of funds effective and artistic direction to propel the san francisco symphony at the summit of north american orchestras 
the europeans anxious about the idea that greater dependence toward private money to mean a conservative programming should also be reassuring to see that the san francisco symphony has one of the most audacious repertoires of united states 
if the public has tastes progressive private money and innovative programming are entirely compatible 
the corollary is that public money makes possible an adventurous programming even if the taste of the public tends to be conservative 
this is one of the reasons why artists in europe like public money he unleashes an exclusive regime , beethoven and mozart 
in addition the public can come to appreciate a repertoire adventurous to force that he proposes 
of course if the public money is reduced to the performing arts not only those here will they be more dependent on private money but the price of places will have to increase 
some regret and prefer the system of tail for obtaining tickets because they fear that higher tariffs do not jeopardise the public future excluding the young 
but low prices for the performing arts do not solve the thorny issue of the access of young 
first of all young people may not benefit from the cheap seats simply because whatever the price classical music is of no interest to them 
then even if they want to go there , it is sometimes impossible to obtain places that are often more available because subscriptions remain between the same hands year after year 
what is the point of having low prices which serve mainly to subsidise the same holders of subscriptions if there are no places 
if the taste for classical music must be subsidised it must encourage better targeted subsidies rather than low prices 
the best way to attract youth to the performing arts is through education 
given that the orchestras americans cannot count on schools or the government to provide the basic music education needed to ensure a constant public to classical music some orchestras are themselves with private money 
in san francisco , for example , the symphony runs a project called keeping score financed with private funds to the tune of twenty three million dollars that includes a national television series of radio broadcasts an interactive learning music and music programmes school 
this type of programme innovative applies as much to european orchestras that americans 
the problem of youth and access to the performing arts exists on both sides of the atlantic 
just as the poor quality of the music education to the public school 
if the orchestras do not care about their own future they may simply not be 
respect for the law to the russian 
everywhere in the world we are concerned about the disappearance of political freedoms in vladimir putin 's russia 
the russians themselves are practically the only ones not to worry about this creeping authoritarianism 
they seem less concerned about the political freedoms that by social protection pensions family violence rights of the child or police brutality 
in reality most russians are indifferent to the efforts by the government to restrict the freedom of the press and the right to protest 
this apathy makes my job as a mediator an institution by the duma parliament to protect the political rights in russia difficult or impossible 
the ombudsman serves as a bridge between the authorities and the people he tries to solve conflicts between organs of the state to citizens 
my office is open not only to the russian citizens but also to foreign nationals and stateless persons who believe that their political rights have been threatened 
we apply the russian constitution but also the principles of international law and human rights standards sometimes even in contradiction with our constitution 
for example as mediator i am opposed to the restriction of the right of russians to be juries 
those who wanted to limit the use of feared juries supposedly for national security 
my office has worked closely with the state to ensure that most of the trials are held with jury 
similarly my office has defended the liberal weekly novoe vremya subject to pressure by the city of moscow on the pretext of a commercial dispute concerning a lease 
the dispute is not resolved but due to my speech the moscow authorities are forced to take account of the negative attitude of the public in their attempts to censor this newspaper 
of course russia offers examples of problems relating to the fundamental political freedoms and much more to the fore as the dirty war in chechnya or the yukos affair 
my office is as much as possible of chechnya although it is not easy since moscow 
i could spend all my time but russia account four twenty nine regions and countless human rights problems to solve 
that is why i have suggested to putin that chechnya to have its own regional mediator , patrolling 
the new chechen authorities seem to welcome 
as regards the yukos affair my office cannot intervene in any legal procedure ongoing 
lawyers for the former director general of yukos mikhail khodorkovsky filed complaints with the european court of human rights in strasbourg 
if khodorkovsky contesting the final decision of the russian courts it will no doubt appeal before this jurisdiction 
it is only at that moment that i be able to give my opinion 
many observers point out , however , that the people that are the subject of a criminal investigation should be released on bail and not imprisoned 
for others it is not possible in the case of khodorkovsky it is very rich and could thus easily escape justice and flee abroad 
that is precisely what made the other individuals accused in the yukos affair 
all these problems in the field of human rights highlight the unfinished nature of russian legal institutions 
for example the duma has put too much time to adopt legislation on the pressure groups who in most democracies developed clearly defines the acceptable and unacceptable behaviour 
khodorkovsky would can be not so much trouble if such laws existed 
but the absence of legislation is directly linked to the absence of clear ideas 
human rights in russia are often flouted simply because the people do not know they have these rights 
the most important objective for my office is that everyone learns to better defend its rights and that the authorities are taking into account the complaints of ordinary russians 
unfortunately , most bureaucrats despise the values of human rights 
but the real difficulty for my office is not ignorance or the legal shortcomings is the fact that in a legal system inadequately developed as that of russia my authority is essentially personal and requires the support of the media 
the notions of human rights is still rudimentary we can best hope a realization that gradually spread 
my strategic objective is to make a better understanding of the ombudsman 's office to get more respect and recognition of the citizens and the state 
it is virtually impossible without cooperation with non-governmental organisations for the defence of human rights in russia 
i believe that one of my tasks is to encourage contacts between these groups and the authorities 
the government 's response to these initiatives will better whether and to what extent the putin government intends to include the political and human rights in the context of its dictatorship of law 
the pope conservative revolutionary 
twenty five years ago the polish people has surprised that one of them cardinal karol wojtyla of krakow has been appointed to the papacy 
some are frightened others have shed tears of joy 
this is as a famous writer the second baptism of poland 
but even in our euphoria we did not expect that the new pope is changing far not only poland but the world 
his first visit to his home country shortly after his inauguration has shown the world the power of the new pope 
the communist police has disappeared from the main streets of warsaw the streets have become models of next 
after decades of deprivation of their autonomy poles have suddenly regained their ability to self-determination 
by saying out loud that there can be no europe without an independent poland on their card , the pope has managed to sweep the colonisation unfair to after war that had permeated poland to soviet power 
then at auschwitz pope said i speak on behalf of all those whose rights are unknown and trampled in the world i am talking about because i am linked we are all linked by the truth 
has this place in this golgotha of modern times he called the poles who remembered their families gazées in the crématoire of auschwitz , as well as those frozen in the concentration camps in siberia to a fraternity devoted to combating hatred and revenge even justified 
some see the pope as the man who caused a religious revival others take for a man of peace 
some see him as a defender of the poor other a criticism of the liberation theology 
for the people of poland jean paul two in that human rights the focal point of his teaching will be forever the man who gave us the courage and the hope which has restored historic our identity 
in fact , during the first decade of his reign the pope has put all its efforts in the fight against the dictatorship and particularly the communist dictatorship 
the strategy made by the pope to the catholic church and its ability to mobilise millions of believers to his cause meant that no one can never repeat the question posed by stalin how many divisions the pope has t it 
jean paul two showed that the moral strength is a weapon powerful enough to undo the division of the world created in yalta 
can be partly because of their strong position anti-communist the catholic church and jean paul two often receive the label of conservatives 
this accusation suggests that the church cannot coexist easily with a pluralist democracy 
it is true that in the fight against communism the polish church has been conservative , thank god 
it has been conservative in its absolute loyalty to the evangelical values to the truth of the faith to its historic identity 
for a system which advocated atheism official and the lie legalised the church has represented a reproach living 
however with the demise of communism the problem encountered by jean paul two and his church at the moment is the next in what language the evangelical values can they be expressed in a world in which the evil is not represented by a political system but is present in every soul 
what is the message of the pope for the post-communist world that he has helped to create 
jean paul two guard undoubtedly its distance with the liberal ideas and liberal state that it often tax of permissiveness and moral relativism 
the pope 's statements are often marred a criticism of individualism in the name of the collective values 
he considers the flaws of liberalism as particularly pernicious in post-communist countries 
the market economy despite its successes practices often seems to his eyes fail to a heart , and to a human face 
it sees the market promotes entrepreneurship at the expense of human solidarity 
jean paul two will not therefore passion for modern western society with its separation from the world of values and he opposed to the moral sensitivities of companies just out of several decades of dictatorship 
as alexander solzhenitsyn pope tends to believe that it is above all in the resistance to totalitarianism that man can become truly free and preserve the fundamental values of civilisation 
i confess that i consider the legacy of communism with more skepticism 
the totalitarian pressure has indeed created exceptional men as jean paul two and alexander solzhenitsyn of people who consider that religious faith has bought the freedom from the lies and solitude 
but it has also created men such as andrei sakharov and vaclav havel , who have defended their supreme values by referring to a secular humanism and speaking on its behalf 
however , for most people life under a totalitarian dictatorship was certainly nothing ennoblissant it was rather a daily immersion in the lies depravity spiritual and the material corruption 
that is why the post-communist societies do no nobility or disinterest which trancheraient deeply with the west 
the defeat of communism has left a large black hole in the souls of the communities a hole which is now fill by ideas of nationalism of intolerance and western consumerism 
but the intuition first of jean paul two is correct the post-communist world of east and west is a spiritual crisis and the pope wishes to undermine it in to be aware of the importance of higher values 
indeed by its words and by example that it shows the pope disrupts the world this last wish to live in the wealth and comfort , and the pope reminds us that we also have to live with dignity 
no labels can only apply to jean paul two who embodies often a set of contrary rejection of compromisoecuménisme ténacitéenthousiasme opening intellectuelleinsistance on theological orthodoxy 
this is a conservative in love with freedom and a supporter of peace which condemns the injustice but which reminds us that the clemency is more important that justice 
it is in that it embodies the paradox that christianity is the sacred principles and sustainable associated with understanding and tolerance 
twenty five years after the departure of jean paul two for rome we poles him remain grateful for having helped us to regain our freedom 
it is a good thing that jean paul two is here 
a world in which everything is changing needs a watchdog to monitor what does not change 
the syndrome interventionist 
kosovo often plays the role of conflict test for the concept of humanitarian intervention 
but while iraq between in the spiral of chaos diplomats and the leaders of all nationalities are wondering again if it is appropriate for alliances of nations or for the international community to intervene when a sovereign country seems unable or unwilling to defend its citizens against genocide or war crimes ethnic cleansing 
at the centre of this debate is the so-called doctrine of the responsibility of protecting 
as a mediator in kosovo appointed by the united nations in the last five years i have had the unique opportunity to observe the effects of this doctrine , after nato intervention in the former yugoslavia in thousand nine hundred four twenty ten nine 
kosovo has become an international experience of building society conducted by the administrative mission caretaker of the un in kosovo unmik 
experience is the right word here 
indeed kosovo was transformed into a test tube of international intervention 
i have lived and worked long enough in kosovo to see the result and i claim that such experiments require more in-depth research 
it is clear that the need for international intervention in the event of a crisis depends on each specific period and a rapid response is often necessary 
however military factors apart from where such interventions are envisaged it is vitally important to concentrate the international policy discussions on the rapid deployment of civilian presence and security linked 
it is even more true when the human suffering is caused by community conflicts as was the case in kosovo 
the immediate deployment of a civil presence and adequate safety directly after the end of the nato bombing of a thousand nine hundred four twenty ten nine could provide appropriate mechanisms of protection against the backlash which has enabled the victims to become executioners 
the peacekeeping forces of nato did not prevent the kidnappings disappearances murderous revenge and the massive destruction of property by ethnic albanian groups which has resulted in a large ethnic cleansing reversed non-albanians serbian majority 
a consequence of this neglect a residue deleterious social and political behind the current kosovo 
instead of calming the community conflicts inter-ethnic hatred is more virulent than ever 
in addition to the lack of security and civilian presence to reassure each community lack in general of legal mechanism to make justice quickly for the crimes committed during and after the intervention has created additional tension 
this tension is so pervasive that any prospect of start the if necessary reconciliation process must now be postponed to a distant future 
similarly in kosovo , the international community has spent little time to help the veterans to consider their collective responsibility for the atrocities that their personal involvement has been directly or indirectly 
without such an effort to try to improve the situation is tantamount to build a house on a pile of sand 
this lack of foresight and projects on the legacy of armed intervention is not only dangerous for the people officially saved it is also against productive 
when a humanitarian intervention is not structured to ensure a basic security antagonisms under jacents that inspired the intervention at the base are that strengthened and not diminished 
six years after the intervention of nato kosovo seems further than ever of stability and social peace 
despite the renewed insurance of the un authorities that kosovo is on the path to reconciliation and real autonomy the nato representatives indicate that there are plans to maintain a long-term military presence in the province in order to ensure that the political process will be put in place with success 
this brings me to another key issue an exit strategy as possible is as important to the success of any future humanitarian intervention that the strategy of entry 
for international intervention has a real chance of success there is from the outset to define the criteria of success 
only such clarity can properly put an end to the commitment of international players 
kosovo such clarity is and has been lacking accordingly nato and the un have no clear idea at the time or on the way in which they must all two withdraw 
one day someone has rightly said that it is easy to bomb but much more difficult to rebuild it is relatively easy to undo a regime militarily but it is much more difficult to build a robust civil society and sustainable in its place 
the united nations general assembly should keep this idea in mind when it begins to codify the doctrine of the responsibility of protecting 
the divisions of the right wing in central europe 
eastern europe is t it achieve a certain political stability 
for a thousand nine hundred four twenty nine the results of the elections have continued to oscillate between the right and the left 
vicktor orban the young and shrewd hungarian prime minister goes t it put an end to this situation 
thanks to a brutal programme designed to absorb his political rivals on his right fidesz hungarian civic party managed to have almost as members that the socialist party on her left 
it has also benefited from internal conflicts in the socialist party , that damaged one of its main assets policies its strict discipline and professionalism inherited from communism 
the efforts made by vicktor orban to bring together under the banner of fidesz a divided right have been partially successful and are unique in eastern europe 
since the collapse of communism in the czech republic in hungary in poland and slovakia the parties of the right moderate are fragmented and lack of a genuine political perspective 
although these countries has not yet fully addressed several tens of years of communist management divisions of the right have facilitated the election victory of the left embodied sometimes by the former communists 
the right-wing forces in central europe face problems similar to those encountered by right-wing parties elsewhere in europe where you can see the social democrats reclaiming the liberal ideas come to occupy them alone the centre of the political spectrum 
in central europe this phenomenon has been amplified by the fact that the ruling parties all political persuasions have had to privatise the economy and introduce under pressure from the european union reforms that in the west would have been performed by the right 
in several countries of central europe left-wing parties have been better placed to carry out these reforms that the right because paradoxically they have greater legitimacy for this 
many people believe that the socialists are not may launch in privatisation or is not set to social protection if there had not absolute necessity 
in central europe the fundamental problem of the right is his lack of identity , clearly defined 
although the politicians from the moderate right claim formally traditional ideologies liberalism or conservatism , for example , their electorate little accustomed to western political concepts do not always understand the meaning of those words 
many opinion polls show that a significant part of the electorate of the different countries of central europe is class of it even right but decades of communism to type paternalistic moved far to the left , the centre of gravity of the region 
so a person can simultaneously declare themselves liberal and ask that the government continues to subsidize the energy education and housing 
under the communist regimes the ideology was merely a tool at the service of power 
as to this time today still a lot of people formally accept the ideological labels but does not want that to the extent that they can remove a tangible benefit in the short term 
this cynicism toward the ideologies creates the brutal turnaround of the electorate 
the problem of identity is exacerbated by the resurgence of nationalism most of the countries of central europe in which the construction of the national identity has been delayed by communism succumb to nationalist sentiments that can be manipulated by politicians 
although some of them say they are right-wing image of vladimir meciar former slovak prime minister have in fact populists demagogues and authoritarian 
the current situation of the right in the countries of central europe is also explained by their history and their tradition 
the political developments in czechoslovakia during the past twenty years of communism has alienated the czech republic and slovakia , poland and hungary 
while poland and hungary have suffered under communism a internal liberalisation that has allowed a part of the activity is officially semi- communist control czechoslovakia has experienced a strict regime stalinist neo-conservatives after the soviet invasion of thousand nine hundred sixty eight 
in a thousand nine hundred four twenty nine when the communist regimes collapsed the communist parties of poland and hungary have become credible democratic parties of the left and they were able to oppose effectively to the parties of the right who created 
but in czechoslovakia the rigid communist party has not been able to give birth to a strong democratic party encré left 
faced with this vacuum the moderate right has had its hands free and was able to retain a certain unity until thousand nine hundred four twenty ten seven 
but the absence of a strong opposition has led to the collapse of the right , which is divided and has lost a common language 
in slovakia country in which the nationalist sentiments have played an important role after a thousand nine hundred four twenty nine the political forces do not come for the moment on an axis right left 
the main political battles between the nationalist and populist forces on the one hand of petrol undemocratic and on the other hand the forces that are fighting for democracy 
the threat of a return to power of meciar led to all the democrats in both the right and the left to stand in the same camp 
even in these circumstances the right remains divided allowing a possible return to power of meciar 
in hungary the right has been a victim of the opposition between conservatives and populist on one side and the liberals belonging mostly to urban classes of the other 
the right-wing parties have not yet agreed to whether they must align the ideologies of traditional western inspiration or on a form of nationalism conservative to hungarian 
although the current ruling coalition made up of conservatives and populists has achieved some success the moment of truth of the right is not yet arrived 
the polish right represents the most difficult 
its problems date back to the time of communism when the solidarity trade union has become the main opposition movement to the communists , while the unions are generally left 
since the fall of communism various groups close of solidarity have wanted to embody the right spreading unrest in the political discourse 
christian democratic parties linked to the church and the liberal parties have been to a certain extent marginalised 
the situation is even more complex than it must count with the populist and nationalist parties they are relatively powerful because they can rely on the peasantry which is an important electoral base in poland 
as in other post-communist countries that are essentially the democratic forces for the left , which have benefited from the divisions of the right 
tired of wal mart 
do you want to know what video clip will soon shaking the decision-makers the world 
the economist thomas holmes following a scenario looks a disturbing to the spread of a global epidemic has prepared a simulation dynamic cartographic showing the expansion of wal mart stores in the united states 
starting with the epicentre to bentonville in arkansas where sam walton opened its first store in thousand nine hundred sixty two the big box stores giants blinds boxes wal mart have now increased to the point that the average american now live in less than seven miles of one of these shops 
it is interesting to note that the shops are moving in the way of the flakes of a flower which is getting and extend 
rather than jump directly to the coasts since four vingts % of americans live within a radius of four vingts miles of the atlantic or the pacific wal mart has spread organically through a chain of suppliers ever-expanding 
even if every new shop steals a part of the clients of the shops wal mart established in the area around the effectiveness of supply steadily improving helps to maintain the overall growth of the chain 
we love it or hate wal mart is undeniably the perfect example of the costs and benefits of modern globalisation 
consumers spend considerably less than in traditional stores 
for example , the economists consider that food mart costs among wal twenty five % cheaper than in a chain of ordinary supermarkets 
the difference in prices for many other consumer products is even greater 
see the astonishing fact with some other shops in the same style target , best buy and home depot wal mart account for approximately 50 % of the increase in productivity america 's much-vaunted compared to europe over the last ten years 
50 % 
and the same kind of advances among the chains of wholesalers account for 20 % further five 
the idea that americans have become better at all during the other rich countries stalled is therefore very wrong 
the miracle of american productivity and the emergence of the trade of style wal mart are practically synonymous 
i have nothing against these great hypermarkets 
they are a boon to consumers at low income and offset in part the tepid growth wages that many of them have suffered over the past two decades 
and i do not agree with some of my friends who snub the shops wal mart and claim to have never set foot 
as a consumer , i love the big box blinds 
it is certainly the case trading partners in america wal mart alone account for more than 10 % of all american imports from china 
but i have reservations about the model wal mart used as pattern director of global growth 
firstly there is the question of its effect on the workers to low wages and on smaller retailers 
surveys show that while remaining within the legality its social policies exploit loopholes in the regulation which , for example , allow it to escape the burden of healthcare costs for many employees wal mart provides health coverage to less than half of its employees 
and the arrival of these hypers in a community crushing retailers long-established often and turn their personality dramatically 
yes , up to a point that is the price of progress 
but the loss of aesthetics and of the community does not depend merely through statistics on income and the price 
the big box blinds are not really nice where their name big boxes 
if their explosive growth continues over the next 20 years the americans they will one day their proliferation as a dramatic illustration of the failure of the models of balanced growth at the regional level 
although many europeans and others would treat the simulation video of holmes replicating the development of wal mart like a horror movie 
the french have can be invented the hypermarket ancestor of the store big box but they have never had the intention to let him develop without control 
the big question for the europeans is whether they can find ways to harness some efficiency gains epitomized by the model wal mart without be overcome by him 
for the americans in addition there is the question of what to do when the phenomenon of big box is blinds equity-price 
if a large part of the american productivity is reduced to leave wal mart and its cousins supermarkets continue their expansion denies that will happen t it when this source of growth are exhausts 
the american economy has many other forces including its financial system higher and its dominant position in goods of high technology but the fact is that the advantage of the united states in this sector has not so far been so striking that the phenomenon wal mart 
it is curious to see how many people seem to think that the us will grow faster than europe and japan over the next ten annéessimplement because that is what happened in the last ten years 
wal mart and others are a central element in our modern era of globalisation 
they are not really the epidemic that their explosive pattern of development indicates but their emergence is not completely benign 
those who wish to emulate the american productivity trends must ask themselves today what they would think the appearance of shops in the form of boxes street politics during their campaign taking the wages down and causing the death of small retailers 
the americans about them must think about the place where is the right balance between aesthetic community and small price 
accept science 
economic progress in the long term is especially allowed by the invention and dissemination of improved technologies 
the scientific revolution has been made possible by the printing press prints the industrial revolution by steam and if india escapes the famine it is thanks to the rise in yields the so-called green revolution 
the era of globalisation that we live in has emerged with the dissemination of computers and internet 
so when we are looking for solutions to global problems some of the most difficult we can also find them at least in part in new technologies that could resolve old seemingly intractable problems 
take the example of poverty in africa 
all the possible explanations have been put forward and are usually the finger on what africans are wrong 
but a visit to the african villages made it clear that the problem is more linked to the fight for survival in physical conditions difficult than to any other inherent problem with african societies 
african farmers produce about a third even less food less per hectare than other operators of the world which has resulted in a large-scale famine exacerbated by the heavy burden of disease 
malaria is a unique challenge in its kind mainly due to the species of mosquitoes of africa particularly able to transmit the disease 
other tropical diseases are parasitic scourges equally vehicles on the continent 
add to the practical difficulty represented by the roads in a bad state and the scarcity of cars and trucks and economic isolation follows 
the challenges of the survival are therefore huge 
practical solutions are accessible , because technologies simple and inexpensive can solve some specific problems 
we can address the low yields thanks to improved seeds specially suited to african conditions associated with technologies to enrich the soil and to manage water 
malaria can control through new nets to the long life and a new generation of effective medicines 
other tropical diseases can also be controlled and technology practice to get drinking water substantially reducing diarrhoeal diseases 
the phones the internet wireless local and more roads could contribute greatly to break the economic isolation african villages 
the donor countries are constantly asking for the africans to change their business policies their government institutions their public administrations and even more 
some of these changes are important but rich countries sometimes go beyond their role by focusing on everything except on how to finance and to introduce practical technologies to solve practical problems 
the mistakes of rich countries would not to consequence if african countries had enough money to adopt the technologies needed all alone but africa is so poor that it needs financial assistance to escape poverty 
the challenges of development in africa are just one example of how difficult problems of companies can be resolved through the development and spread of improved technologies 
the same will be true of the best way to solve the problem of climate change caused by human another of these seemingly intractable global problems 
for the moment the rich countries to alter the global climate with millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide each year by the use of coal , oil and natural gas 
in the coming years china and india will also contribute greatly to the increase in the rate of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 
and yet no country that it is rich or poor did very keen to reduce its energy consumption worried that such a move could threaten its jobs its income and its economic growth 
new technology will provide a solution very important 
already the hybrid car which combine petrol and battery can roughly double the fuel efficiency and divide by two carbon dioxide emissions 
in addition , engineers have developed techniques to capture and underground storage and course of carbon dioxide from burning coal in the plants 
this new technology can reduce four vingts % the emission of carbon dioxide in the production of electricity 
the costs are relatively modest 
consider also the depopulation of the oceans due to overfishing 
the global demand for fish is increasing as global capacity of fishing what threat of extinction some species 
a aquaculture improved in which the fish are bred in incubators of tanks and is still far from a perfect technology particularly for environmental reasons and yet it is very promising 
during a recent visit to africa a prominent agricultural stated that in the world the scientist is more than ever around the farmer but further than ever of the legislator 
politicians do not understand science and rarely seek the advice of scientists and engineers when they want to solve major problems 
everything is seen from the perspective of politics and elections and nothing is regarded as a technical problem requiring a technological expertise which is why the african poverty is so often attributed to corruption rather than of the environmental challenges 
it is easy to dismiss the suggestion that the technology can be the solution 
after all the technological progress are also asking for a good government market forces of university and even more effective 
the policy is also a role to play 
in any case it is time to recognise that the governments are poorly equipped to understand the technological challenges sophisticated and the opportunities that the world could benefit and that new methods are necessary to ensure that we give to science and technology the position needed to tackle a wide range of global issues taking an increasingly urgent 
now it is time that all the major international agencies and all governments take responsibility to use the scientific expertise and technology they will need the twenty-first century 
unblock the situation in latin america 
one of the biggest breaks the head of the global economy is undoubtedly the poor performance of latin america 
since the beginning of the ' thousand nine hundred four vingts latin america has been blocked with income per capita income growing slowly if there was in the majority of the region and with a great crisis to repeat 
many policies have been tempted especially trade liberalisation privatization of state-owned enterprises and ineffective fiscal reforms 
however something prevents latin america forward 
the lack of robust growth is even more disconcerting in the light of the many benefits and social achievements of latin america 
the natural resources are plentiful and the fertile lands abound 
the health conditions are relatively acceptable and all the countries of latin america have made progress against illiteracy the majority getting at least four twenty ten percent of adult literacy 
in addition fertility rates have fallen to a rate that the populations of many countries stabilises probably in the coming decades 
the condition of women has improved and the girls have equal access to education with enrollment rate higher than the boys in many countries 
latin america is probably known for his macho culture but the rate of women in the active population continues to grow and they are increasingly political positions and leading social 
latin america is very proud of other benefits in the long term 
most of its citizens live on the coast and enjoy privileged access to international trade and other live in cities another advantage for growth 
indeed the region is not poor according to international standards but rather stuck in the beach of income funds between the world 's poorest countries and the high income countries of north america to europe and east asia 
how to explain the surprising lack of real growth in the twenty five years 
i reject the responsibility on two unsolved problems but soluble 
the first is there for centuries the social divisions whose origins date back to the european conquest of the native americans in the sixteenth century 
even more than in other countries in latin america is born during a violent conquest 
the europeans have permeated the indian population and have also brought especially in the caribbean basin and brazil of massive cargoes of african slaves 
the companies have become racially and ethnically complex when the european populations have practiced indian and african intermarriage but the trend over the long term the european dominance enslavement and indigenous american african-american and poverty firmly grounded have deeply marked the companies in latin america 
even today income inequalities in latin america are among the most important world reflecting the old models of racial and ethnic division 
the income inequality leaves a large shadow 
the rich are fighting for a long time against taxes needed to increase investment in the education sector and the health of the poor perpetuating the profound social divisions and leaving many individuals without the health and skills required by global competitiveness 
the situation is improving today in some countries such as brazil , which bodes well for the future 
in other countries such as guatemala and parts of the andean region social divisions remain marred by violence and mistrust 
in addition to this problem a fundamental failure of the economic strategy has been largely ignored a failure which is reflected in the major difference between the discussions on public policy in latin america and asia 
in asia the public debate door on technology how asia can 't it catch up 
asian governments act with tenacity to increase the scientific and technological capabilities of their economies 
in latin america the technological revolution world is much less discussed and national policies designed to promote the science and technology is rarely climbing in the foreground 
result latin america has not been able to draw properly party of global technological revolutions 
the developing asian countries now produce computers of semi- drivers of pharmaceutical products and software 
by contrast , even the seller star of latin america chile remains largely an export economy based on resources heavily focused on the export of copper and agricultural products 
these sectors are technologically sophisticated but form a narrow base for long-term development 
the situation is far from being desperate 
brazil has shown predispositions to be a technological export power 
he has managed obviously to export aircraft and many consumer goods sustainable 
mexico has also started to mobilise a huge technological know 
argentina , chile and other countries could become advanced agricultural producers at the vanguard of the agro biotechnology for example if they bothered 
however the countries of latin america have not yet tried to trigger a technological revolution certainly not with the degree of importance the competence of the commitment and funding shown by the asian countries 
such a push could play a major role in the take-up of economic growth 
such a policy would commit to significantly increase research and development expenditure as did the asian countries developing 
the countries of latin america must increase spending up to achieve two % of gnp currently zero comma five % in part through public support for laboratories and universities and in part by benefits for research and development from the private sector they should roll out the red carpet for high-tech multinational firms as asia has done 
they also need to focus more on training in science and technology and encourage a greater proportion of students to receive a university education 
according to the government school and for the new universities as well as for universities agrandies can play a big role as investments in computers and information technology in the schools and communities 
the social programme and the technological programme depend on one of the other 
both require companies to latin america to invest more in individuals who are affected by these programmes , so that the latino americans can put itself at the forefront of progress in terms of global productivity 
if these investments affect all the countries of latin america both rich and poor prospects of the region is illumineront considerably 
the price of real estate , a house of cards 
the first major city to know a boom was london around a thousand nine hundred four twenty sixteen 
this attitude spread to los angeles , new york and sydney to thousand nine hundred four twenty ten seven and paris in thousand nine hundred four twenty ten eight until miami moscow and shanghai in two thousand a vancouver and two thousand two 
these cities and others have seen house prices surge since that time prices are upwards of at least 50 % in constant prices for two thousand 
this was the source of important windfall profits for the owners but also a source of problem for any person preparing to acquire a property 
today , the increase in home prices falters in some of these large cities 
the rate of growth in london and new york has slowed down dramatically over the past year and fell to a % of a real increase in the second quarter of two thousand four 
sydney has the price of homes are actually fell during the second quarter 
is this the end of the boom 
no city in benefit 
worse still , the mood of the real-estate markets could lead to a fall in prices 
no one had predicted the boom then predict its end is risky 
housing prices have shown a terrible bottom-up movement against the previous warnings of the end of the festival 
any prediction about the end of the boom requires an understanding of the reasons for its development in so many different cities 
curiously there is no explanation generally accepted because the ultimate causes of the boom is mainly psychological 
economists prefer to discuss interest rates or the unemployment statistics of concrete factors and likely to be known 
of course these indicators have a legitimate role to play in the explanation of the housing markets , but they are simply not enough to explain the recent booms 
three psychological causes out of all this , first of all , an amendment to the public 's perception about the sources of value in a changing global economy then growing confidence of the public in cities glamour whose name is known worldwide and finally the simple exhilarating dynamic speculative bubbles 
each factor deserves greater if you want to understand the present market conditions and future discern the price trends 
first the world economy seems more chaotic than it was ten years ago 
the fall in share prices since two thousand in most countries gives an air little reassuring to financial assets , stimulating the refuge towards the quality is in this case to the stone 
more terrorism is now seen as a problem for everyone indonesia spain and russia having suffered their own tragedies 
we are reassured by investing in stone , and there is little reason to expect an imminent change 
the fear and the surge in home prices is encourage mutually 
then the public 's trust in the international cities glamour increases thanks to the explosive growth of global communication via the internet and the mobile phone 
just as people increasingly admire international celebrities we centers of business of technology and culture and whose names are familiar to everybody everywhere have a unique value 
as for the fear of terrorism and the lack of confidence in the stock markets the geographical celebrity seems elastic not to say autorenforcée more new york , paris and london are famous more they are glamorous 
finally the contagion that under speculative bubble tends any cannot be ignored 
the current boom has seen the contagion spread inside the markets and through the markets the rising price of fuel popular excitement and thus the price increase it even in the same city and then in other cities to the other side of the planet 
the inhabitants of shanghai do can be struggling not house prices in london but the leaders of public opinion in shanghai know what is happening in london and all boom is producing in this city makes the possibility of a boom in shanghai plausible 
by opposition to the two other psychological reasons the speculative contagion has a natural end 
a speculative bubble that is fueling it even solely on the reaction to rising prices cannot continue indefinitely 
so where that leads t it 
two of the psychological causes suggest a continuous rise in house prices , while the third suggests the end of this movement upward one of these days without specifying when 
i bet that some of the cities so strongly glamorous will continue to assist the slowdown in the growth of home prices and then possibly to their decline 
historically the price of real estate has always demonstrated strong movements and prices in all of these cities is still rising at a rate important even if it is generally somewhat slower than a year or two ago 
if we extrapolate the growth trends it seems reasonable to forecast that prices will continue to grow substantially in most of these cities for a year or two , even if the growth rate continues to decline 
the psychological factors are more important for the long-term forecasts beyond a year when the upward movement no longer plays an important role 
at this stage the prices will probably unstable downwards because the enthusiasm for investment in stone collapses probably at the same time that the decline in price growth 
prices in cities glamour will fall significantly to the next recession or when the economy will suffer are next big shock or even if interest rates rise too quickly 
then the contagion inside and through the markets fall by falling prices for years 
water for all 
this month once more water has taken centre stage in the fourth world water forum of mexico 
it is a good time while the attention of a large part of the world is focused on issues of energy supply and security of hundreds of millions of people in developing countries still see the supply of fresh water as just as important , if not more 
the investigations by the world bank in developing countries show that when you ask the poor to appoint the three most important challenges they face their good health is still part of this list 
and the key factor that determines whether they will keep this good health remains access to clean water 
today the world over a billion people do not have access to 
so they are always more easily prey to bad health 
the world bank estimates that in two thousand thirty five nearly three billion people almost all in developing countries could live in conditions of severe water shortages , particularly if they live in africa to the middle east or south asia 
this will cause the obvious difficulties but it also hamper economic growth needed to these millions of people escape poverty 
in latin america nearly 15 % of the population is nearly sixty 16 million people has no access to safe drinking water and one hundred 16 million people have access to any health service 
the numbers are worse for africa and parts of asia 
this is a situation that few people face in rich countries 
usually the citizens of those countries benefit from public services that meet all their water needs since the drink until irrigation and the health needs 
in addition to other issues related to water , such as the risks posed by the floods have been reduced to manageable levels 
the rich industrial countries have invested very early and massively in infrastructure the institutions and water management 
the results beyond the health benefits that this provides to all have provided evidence of a record economic growth it is enough to examine the hydroelectric investments to understand the positive impact of projects management of water in many countries 
of course the rich countries have some advantages they have generally moderate climates where the rains are regular , and usually pose little risk of drought and flood 
even so they are not immune from disasters related to water as the destruction of new orleans by hurricane katrina has shown 
but the impact of such events on poor countries is far more important 
the extreme fluctuations of the rains floods and droughts can have social and economic effects and result in loss of life on a large scale 
the coast of the gulf of mexico and the countries of central america are constantly the experience of such tragedies the deprived communities are the most vulnerable and least able to deal with these events 
ethiopia and yemen are two examples equally remarkable one than the other 
the development potential of ethiopia is so closely linked to the seasonal rains that sharp movements in the rain and the lack of infrastructure has undermined the growth and perpetuated poverty 
a simple drought can reduce the growth potential of 10 % in the long term 
yemen about him has no permanent surface water and its citizens totally dependent on the rains of groundwater and floods 
to move forward the developing countries need new infrastructure and better management of water 
any approach must be designed in connection with the specific context of each country and the needs of their respective people but there is no forced to basis linked to investments of exploitation of water which ensures that local communities and the environment can learn tangible benefits quickly 
in some countries the implementation of new infrastructure for the water usually mean the creation of channels of pumping stations and dikes 
other countries may need more profound reservoirs sewage treatment plants more modern systems or of water transport improved 
all of this can possibly be designed to improve and extend the reserves of water for irrigation , power generation and industrial use private and while guaranteeing a certain security against droughts and some protection against flooding 
the key to the success of any increase investment in infrastructure of water st. to increase proportionally investments in the institutions that administer water 
if the infrastructure is badly managed that will not help to improve the health of populations or support economic growth the organisation of water and water management must function pair 
the infrastructure can and must be developed in parallel with good institutions well managed in respect for the environment and with a fair share of costs and benefits 
a policy of investment in the water that reduced the vulnerability of the poor and provides access to the water for all requires a personalized management and a special partnership between the donor countries the governments of developing countries the private sector and local communities 
delegates from the world water forum will have multiple opportunities to forge and strengthen these partnerships 
if they succeed the benefits that will draw the poor people of the world will be immense 
germany in a state of economic shock 
over the past ten years germany experienced economic growth the slowest of the european union and the growth europe the slower the world 
one thousand nine hundred four fifteen to twenty two thousand five german growth will not exceeded 14 comma six % while the average of the old eu was twenty four % that of the united states thirty nine comma nine % and that of the global economy forty five comma six % 
that is what is so bad results of germany 
according to franz müntefering leader of the social democratic party at the head of germany that is simply because the country is already where other people want go 
the slow german growth supports it is a sign of natural convergence 
this theory is far from convincing 
germany has recently been doubled in terms of per capita income by many eu countries including ireland , the united kingdom , the netherlands and france and its growth is slower than their 
another theory more plausible is that over the past fifteen years several external challenges or shocks have simultaneously rocked the country 
trapped by its rigidity its social system extended and a labour market very regulated germany has been unable to react to these shocks and began to encounter problems 
this theory is not without reminiscent of the british historian arnold toynbee that empires crumble because they are unable to respond to the external challenges 
the first shock was the intensification of globalisation that caused the massive influx of low-wage competition 
even if globalisation is a gradual process she won in energy when china has decided to enter the game 
china is ten times the size of japan and japan had not been very easy to manage 
the instruments of precision and the german optical equipment , for example , have lost competitiveness when japan entered into stage 
the second shock has been that of european integration including enlargement in the north and south 
the dismantling of the eu 's internal frontiers has expanded all of a sudden the size of national markets and caused the economies of scale planned 
but this phenomenon has favoured the small european countries that the big and has involved more competition for germany , the biggest economy in europe 
take the mobile phone maker nokia 
thanks to the economies of scale made possible by the common market , nokia has been able to fully exploit its inventions so that german siemens had recently decided to drop the mobile phone market 
the third shock has been the euro the european currency has caused rapid convergence of long-term interest rates that in some countries have reached up to five to seven points of %age more than in germany 
freed from the exchange rate risks international investors are asking for more risk premium in these countries and willingly provide all of their money on favourable terms what was once the preserve of germany 
europe is that profits because the capital are now better distributed and growth driven by the movement of economies of germany to remote areas and formerly disadvantaged in the euro zone 
however the benefit is doubtful for german workers who also would have wanted to take advantage of this capital 
the fourth shock has taken the form of the eastward enlargement of the eu , which has caused extraordinary opportunities for trade and investment but also the flurry of labor at low prices 
on average wage levels in the ten countries which joined the eu in two thousand four represent only 14 % of those of west germany 
low wage competition has led to substantial relocation and offshore activities that have allowed the german companies to remain competitive by reducing their labor demand national 
given that neither the unions or the german social system could not accept pay cuts the result has been an increase in unemployment and the slowdown in growth 
the fifth shock that is the unification of germany a failure in terms of economy 
gdp per person of working age in east germany accounted for 61 % of the level of west germany in thousand nine hundred four twenty sixteen but it is waning today at fifty nine % 
the slow growth of the east of the country has worsened the german average while the huge demand for public funds is widening public debt 
the weakness of the fiscal position in turn has undermined investor confidence with obvious impact on economic growth 
these five shocks are historical developments beneficial for the whole world but problematic for germany 
if the country wants to face up to its challenges and continue to grow it must make its labour market 
this is that if wages are adjust downwards to adapt to the new global environment that german workers redeviendront competitive and that the country is again a low unemployment rate by exploiting its human capital until the constraint of capacity 
the new government that voters will likely choose in september will be faced with the difficult task of put the germans in the face of reality and introduce the necessary reforms 
it was only then we will know if germany is able to face the challenge of toynbee who expects 
the lessons of the tsunami 
many lessons emerge from the tsunami cause of both of devastation and loss of human life in asia 
this is proof of globalisation whereas television showed the vivid images of the destruction of homes in the world 
indeed it is in those moments where the world really looks like a global village 
of course , it seems that the information on the scale of the disaster take longer to reach the president bush 's ranch in crawford , texas 
but he finally decided to interrupt his holiday to offer aid that the amount has ceased to be revised upwards in international competition that promised to benefit those who wanted desperately to be helped 
american aid still seems mean-spirited by comparison with the amounts offered by countries that do not have a fraction of american wealth 
australia , which is sparsely populated has offered more than double american aid japan has promised 50 % more than america and europe has embarked on a sum five times 
this has helped many observers point out that the richest country in the world was in fact the more wretched in terms of international aid even more when it is compared to the sums involved in defence and the war 
this disaster is international , too , is it appropriate that the united nations to take the lead in coordinating the humanitarian effort 
unfortunately , in an effort that was widely seen as a new attempt to undermine multilateralism the united states have tried to take the head of a core group of assistance programme for ignoring the relentless efforts within the region and under the auspices of the united nations 
what that has been the pattern of america it decided later join wisely the united nations in their efforts 
the rhetoric used to save the face of the bush administration , claiming that it was set up a core group in the absence of any other effort has slowly been neglected 
the response of some countries in the region was really impressive showing the progress made in the establishment of governments efficient and effective 
myriad details were examined thailand sent ambassadors in the affected regions of the country to help meet the needs of citizens " aida " those who have lost everything passport and goods home soigna wounded mit systems in place of identification of the body and traita the difficulties posed by the shortage of body bags and the lack of places for the conservation of body refrigerated 
countries like thailand have seen that they could cope with the financial consequences by themselves have asked that humanitarian aid is being sent to other countries 
they have asked that one thing the reduction of tariffs and better access to foreign markets 
they were asking for charity just a chance to win their own income 
they have received at least as i write that a silence implacable 
furthermore the g seven chose to contribute significantly by offering to alleviate the debt 
this is particularly important in the case of indonesia , whose debt service amounts to one hundred and thirty two billion dollars 60 of which ten due to public creditors or guaranteed by the government administrations 
even without the throes of the tsunami the burden of this debt would have been a huge disability in the development of this country still recovering from the consequences of the financial crisis of thousand nine hundred four twenty ten seven 
indeed the indonesian debt relief is a convincing case to the extent that most of the debts were incurred on the occasion of loans granted to the corrupt government of suharto 
the leaders knew or should have known that a part of the total claimed was not going to be attributed to the development of indonesia 
more a part of the debt was incurred during the crisis of thousand nine hundred four twenty ten seven thousand nine hundred four twenty ten eight aggravated and extended by the policies imposed by the imf 
no one pretends that it is possible to alter or to prevent the forces of nature 
rather , we must learn to manage them 
this is now warning systems improved to prevent possible tsunamis 
we already have , however , received a warning in the field of climate change 
most countries recognise this and gathered in rio and kyoto to act together even if it is insufficient the kyoto protocol was designed as a first step in the right direction 
unfortunately the warming of the planet will destroy probably the same countries that those who come to be devastated by the tsunami 
the islands of low altitude as the maldives will be submerged 
we are not yet a global village 
after contesting the scientific evidence highlighting the problems the biggest polluter in the world the united states has simply refused to act beyond the simple appeal to a certain voluntary restriction that we see little to work in america in any case 
the international community must still consider the treatment to treat this absurd that refuses to take responsibility for global citizen 
the optimists say that the technology will enable us to solve these problems 
the realists will see that in the long race between technology and the environment it seems that the technology is to this day , the big loser 
the nature as shown by the tsunami has its own clock 
until we have learned to the respect we will miss all the train 
the accuracy of the experts 
every day the experts we are bombarded with their views on subjects as diverse as the iraqi insurgents coca growers bolivians european central bankers and the politburo of north korea 
how are they credible these experts 
an optimistic view is that as long as those who sell expertise are competing vigorously for the attention of the media sagaces buyers market mechanisms will ensure quality control 
the experts published in the opinion pages of newspapers or who spend on television and radio must certainly enjoy a good reputation because otherwise they would have been eliminated 
skeptics warn , however , that the media we impose their choice of speakers and that they are less interested in the debates reasoned that by how to adapt to the popular prejudices 
as a result the celebrity may very well be linked negatively and not positively to the accuracy long-term 
until recently nobody knew who was right because nobody preserved trace the results of these experts 
but a research staggered over twenty years suggests today that sceptics are the closest to the truth 
i describe this project in detail in my book " expert political judgment how good is it how can we know 
the political judgment of experts that is it 
how do we know the original idea was to ask for thousands of predictions from hundreds of experts about the fates of dozens of countries and noted these predictions according to their accuracy 
we have discovered that not only the media are not eliminating bad ideas , but they often favour especially when the truth is too complex to be presented much 
the evidence fall into two categories 
first as have warned the sceptical when hordes of experts are fighting for the spotlight many are tempted to claim that they know more than they actually 
the experts providing for the worst and the best are those who have the more inclined to exaggerate 
between a thousand nine hundred four twenty five and two thousand five experts were the most optimistic forecasts over ten years that exaggerated the chances of major positive changes both in the financial markets by ex a dow jones to thirty six thousand and in terms of global policy , for example , the calm in the middle east and dynamic growth in africa sub saharan 
they have assigned probabilities sixty five % to rosy scenarios that materialised in only 15 % of cases 
during the same period the the most pessimistic experts were even more mistaken by exaggerating the risks of negative changes even where the experts were too optimistic in good news and adding many other i am still waiting for the imminent disintegration of canada of nigeria , india , indonesia , south africa of belgium and sudan 
they have attributed the odds of 70 % to dire scenarios that have realised that in 12 % of cases 
in addition , as had again predicted the skeptical experts claiming to know more in reality rarely pay their mistakes 
indeed the media their pay much attention while neglecting their colleagues more modest 
you can see this process particularly highlighted when following the philosopher sir isaiah berlin we catégorisons hérissons experts and foxes 
hedgehogs are those who have big ideas and amourachent grand theories libertarianism marxism environmentalism etc . 
their self-confidence can be contagious 
they know how to maintain the momentum of a discussion by multiplying the reasons showing that they are right and that the others are wrong 
that is what their wins the approval of the media 
but they do not know at what time based on their mental brake by making concessions to other points of view 
they take their theories too seriously 
result hedgehogs commit more mistakes but they accumulate more success on google 
the eclectic foxes arrive better to calm their ideological enthusiasm 
they feel more comfortable in the face of prolonged uncertainty about who has reason even in bitter debates admit their shortcomings and give legitimacy to opposing views 
they punctuate their conversations of conjonctions which limit the scope of their arguments , but although 
as they avoid too simplify the foxes commit fewer errors 
the foxes are often agree with hedgehogs until a certain point before complicate things yes my colleague was right when he said that the saudi monarchy is vulnerable , but remember that the states are rare and that the government has many ways to crush the opposition 
imagine that your job in the media depend on your ability to broaden your audience 
which would select you an expert who balance of arguments antagonistic and concludes that the most likely outcome is that nothing will change or an expert who takes the audience on tenterhooks with stories of radical islamists who take control and cause a surge in oil prices 
in short , the qualities that make the foxes more inclined to the accuracy make them less popular 
at this point in the sceptics little charitable gloussent that we have the media that we deserve 
but this is not just 
no society has even created a reliable method for assessing the results of the experts 
even the citizens who adopted the accuracy have little means to know that they sacrifice when they change of the chain to move from boring foxes to hérissons charismatic 
it is here that between a modest proposal that applies to all democracies the market of ideas works better if it is easier for people to see exchanges between accuracy and entertainment or between the accuracy and loyalty to a party 
do they not reportedly more reports of experts who have had the most often right 
in this case the experts could become more reliable showing more humility and political debate begin to be less strident 
agree it is not easy to create ways to assess who was right and who would cover the whole spectrum of opinions reasonable 
but in a world where as yeats the worst are full of passionate intensity and the best lack any conviction it is worth trying 
what future for europe 
in many ways two thousand five represents the annus horibilis europe 
it has started well with the approval of the proposed constitutional treaty by the spanish voters but it has turned sour when french and dutch voters rejected it shortly after 
those votes reflected in part the discontent of voters toward the internal policies as well as their disappointment with the conduct of government of european affairs 
governments are then sent to offer them always more of these cases unsatisfactory 
in the days that followed , these elections were they do not agree on the european union budget for the period from two thousand seven to two thousand thirteen 
the french and british leaders have engaged in a dispute that has wrecked the summit which followed just before britain takes over the rotating presidency of the european union in july 
usually the countries concerned use the presidency of the european union to demonstrate their ability to solve problems and move the european union 
but since the beginning of december britain sleeps 
in addition to the funeral of the proposed constitutional treaty it has largely abandoned the issue of the budget 
there is very little chance that it reaches to adopt the budget this year , and less to quickly resolve the dispute the european union will have no operating budget for two thousand seven 
even if the budget will eventually be adopted the austrian presidency which opens the first january will absolutely not depressing affairs 
the biggest problem is the inability to accelerate its growth and to offer jobs to its citizens 
this is mainly due to the three major france , germany and italy that produce 70 % of european gdp 
the collective response adopted in two thousand was the lisbon strategy which aims to make the european union the most dynamic economy and more competitive in the field of knowledge in the world in two thousand ten 
a more realistic it is designed to offer governments the necessary encouragement for the care of reforms of everything that slows economic growth and productivity 
this means the clash of a myriad of interest groups since the industrial lobbies until the unions and the frozen bureaucrats who have so far managed to protect their area 
the strategy is based on the peer pressure and is to point the finger at the governments , which are not going to confuse them 
in practice , however , the peer pressure turned into collusion of peers 
when the leaders of the european union met last spring to take stock of their progress they have admitted a pitiful that the objectives of the lisbon strategy had little chance of achieving 
they could at best now stop pretending to be this strategy and continue their progress in other areas 
unfortunately josé manuel barroso who presided over the summit two thousand while he was prime minister of portugal and president of the european commission had put his presidency in stake in the case of the lisbon strategy 
we must expect to see the defending of desperate way 
one of the few good ideas to the lisbon strategy was to remove the barriers for the exchange of services 
the competition of services in europe is restricted by countless national regulations which for example determine strictly regulated professions such as hairdressing or plumbing 
one of the key features of recent decades is the significant increase in productivity in the field of services in the united states , but this is absolutely not happened in europe 
guess why 
because the services account for 70 % of european gdp and the potential impact of a competition improved is important 
however , it is always difficult politically to remove the protections 
the european commission has made a proposal in two thousand five at the same time that the constitution was put to the vote 
it is hardly surprising that this proposal has quickly was abandoned 
today , while a large number of groups of private interests are trying to dilute it up to strip it of all its meaning this battle will certainly be included in the agenda of the european union for two thousand six 
europe also blocks progress of the doha round in international trade negotiations the fact of the agricultural lobby who fight to preserve its subsidies 
many governments fear their farmers at the point of having no choice other than to not give whatever the circumstances 
europe has accepted the idea of a single trade policy 
when the differences are as deep as they are in the case of agriculture there is no latitude for successful negotiations 
there is little reason to remain optimistic 
and what will the future of the ecb which has to adjust its key interest rates to zero comma twenty five % after 30 months of waiting 
the experts may not agree on the relevance of this decision but no one is in agreement with the many political leaders who say that this small increase will derail the little recovery in economic growth 
the acidity of political attacks against the ecb could trigger dangerous debates on the restriction of its independence 
even if there is no question that this will happen because it would require changing the european treaty all the noise is not healthy 
it deflects the ecb its objectives and has flesh out the idea that europe is a bad thing , and above all , this will be used as a scapegoat by the governments failing to explain their failures 
we can expect other reactions anti ecb 
europe is in a rut 
the current team of leaders has disappointed greatly 
yet we have a chance to see the light at the end of the tunnel with their gradual replacement 
in germany , chancellor angela merkel seems more positive on the issue of europe and more focused on the reforms that his predecessor , but it has the hands linked by the grand coalition that supports 
in france , president jacques chirac image par excellence of the leader hostage to its pressure groups unsteady , so powerless towards the end of his mandate scheduled for two thousand seven 
the two leaders appointed to replace him dominique de villepin and nicolas sarkozy both in government clashing on the bottom of the agendas of reform , but the years that precedent an election do not encourage radical changes 
italy about it will have to decide whether it wants to replace prime minister silvio berlusconi , who shows no interest in the reforms and european affairs by romano prodi man prudent and former president of the european commission 
tony blair once ardent defender of europe at least according to the demanding standards of britain may well have to cede finally power to gordon brown who is well known for his lack of warmth towards european integration 
fortunately britain has always been of outsider 
finally , whatever the light at the end of the tunnel it shines can be not before two thousand seven after the french elections 
tame politicians on both sides of the atlantic 
despite the occasional ronchonnements politicians nobody seriously doubt the independence of the european central bank nor the fact that the monetary policy in force in the euro zone is therefore well protected against political pressures 
but the recent death of the stability and growth pact killed by germany his father with a france playing the role of co conspirateur and complicit complacent reminds us of a key lesson elected politicians find difficult if not impossible to abandon a immense power in the area of tax policy 
this situation applies across the atlantic 
the us federal reserve is , of course , extremely independent 
but any attempt to limit the fiscal discretion of the us federal government in the way of the stability pact for example the law grammrudman notorious of the clinton era collapses always at the end to the pressure of the president and congress 
in the years of election monetary policy can be used to stimulate if this is no longer an economy as fiscal policy and that is the objective of politicians 
but the unconsidered use of one of these two mechanisms in order to achieve short-term goals could create long-term costs for certain restrictions imposed on the latitude that have politicians to influence the macroeconomic policies 
when politicians can control inflation in exercising a decisive influence on the central banks they can use their power to devalue the burden of public debt , thus avoiding the need for an additional tax to repay this debt 
this has been the great lesson years thousand nine hundred seventy and the early years thousand nine hundred four vingts when a rampant inflation has forced politicians to renounce this power to the benefit of independent central banks which only could convince the markets that price stability would be restored 
the monetary policy , however , is not a single method of drafting economic policies 
the aspects of fiscal policy could also be delegated to independent bureaucrats in order to keep the politicians on the ranks 
why , for example not given to an independent bureaucracy a few goals of redistribution or control over the level of public investment or management of the deficits 
an independent tax authority could probably apply the long-term objectives of a society in these areas better than the politicians who have their eyes set on the next elections 
indeed , in principle , it is impossible to understand why the monetary policy and fiscal policy must be considered so differently one being fully delegated to an agency bureaucrat and the other being completely discretionary and left in the hands of politicians 
so why this vast difference t it , in fact , both in america and in europe 
because the fiscal policy is the major tool used by politicians to attract and retain the support of a winning coalition of voters made up of pensioners of officials and owners of the middle classes while imposing costs on the coalition loser 
it is not necessary to keep 100 % of voters , but just a sufficient number to victory 
the fiscal card plays a critical role in the choice of groups of voters to buy 
the tax authorities independent or tax rules such as the stability pact hinder this political use of fiscal policy that is proving expensive 
after all if politicians cannot win elections by taking the money of a few voters including future generations who will bear part of the bill to restore to others they will have to work much harder to show some ability to produce public benefits for all 
this is a task much more difficult 
of course the policy also includes effects of redistribution 
think of the various effects of interest rates on debtors by opposition creditors 
monetary policy is , however , a rather more indirect clumsy and imprecise to choose the winners and losers that fiscal policy 
independent central banks can sometimes be a nuisance for politicians but at least they can serve as scapegoats when necessary a role which the political benefits outweigh the costs of the loss of control on a useful tool 
these considerations should guide the choice of the system to replace the stability pact in europe 
it is now quite clear that national governments and especially those of the large countries will never accept limits on their hefty fiscal discretion 
they can have temporarily withdrawn their freedom of manoeuvre in fiscal policy long enough to allow the launch of the euro but in normal conditions national governments will claim their tax territory 
the european commission must therefore cease to wage a battle of rear guard who only weakens his credibility , especially in the eyes of the small countries which are the only ones on which it is possible to apply pressure to accept unwanted fiscal rules 
realistically the commission can only ask the european national governments to ensure that their tax accounts are transparent and clear 
it is impossible to prevent the use of fiscal policy policy 
but at least the fiscal measures of a country should not be hidden in the notes obscure footnote in its budgets 
even this limited target can be hard to achieve 
a strategic lack of transparency is in the interest of astute politicians who want to keep a pressure group , by concealing the costs of the largesse of the public to the majority of citizens 
the rules governing the behaviour of politicians must not be written as if officials disinterested and well-intentioned would apply them 
politicians are ready to give a lot of trouble to satisfy their supporters and win elections 
we can best hope to ensure that the worst acts they commit to be made to face discovered 
the european union will t it promises to turkey 
there are more than 40 years turkey has asked to become an associate member of the european economic community 
the association agreement of thousand nine hundred sixty three has created a special relationship crowned with the customs union in thousand nine hundred four twenty sixteen 
for all these years european governments have continued to reaffirm that turkey could become a state full member provided to respect the membership criteria 
formal recognition of his candidacy into a thousand nine hundred four twenty ten nine prompted turkey to take a set of reforms without precedent in the field of human rights and the rights of minorities including the abolition of the death penalty the adoption of guarantees against torture promoting religious freedoms and the equality between the sexes and restricting the role of the army in political life 
if the european union considers the membership criteria were met it must start negotiations at the beginning of the year two thousand five 
otherwise the eu reneging on its political commitments and seriously undermine his credibility in the world 
yet around europe this membership is viewed with scepticism due to the size of turkey and its economic situation by fear of a mass immigration and , above all , cultural and social differences a euphemism refers to islam 
we cannot deny that some of these factors are huge challenges 
but they are often exaggerated and certainly not insurmountable 
negotiations with turkey would be long and membership may not take place before two thousand fifteen 
this period would allow turkey as the union to prepare 
with four vingts million inhabitants turkey would become one of the largest member states of the european union 
but the role of the size of the country is limited in the eu 's decision-making process where the political influence depends more on the economic power 
in addition turkey is for several decades a responsible member of many european institutions and there is no reason to think that it behaving differently in the union 
because of the weakness of its economy turkey could claim to be substantial subsidies 
but these transfers would depend on financial policy of the eu at the time of the accession of the outcome of negotiations and economic developments turkish 
in all cases the capping of the budget practised by the eu would an explosion of financial cost of turkey 's accession 
immigration should not cause unnecessary concern 
human mobility is limited and the turkish workers would probably the right to move freely in the european union after a long period of transition can be not before two thousand twenty five 
given the strong growth expected of the turkish economy and falling birth rate experts estimate that there would be about two comma seven million immigrants 
meanwhile the reduction and the ageing of the population in most of europe have made immigration essential 
but among the countries of origin likely of migrants turkey offers the best chance of successful adaptation 
it is the muslim population of turkey , which is the most emotion 
many have the feeling that turkey has no place in a european company founded on a culture and christian traditions 
it also fears that the islamists do a day of turkey a fundamentalist state 
as unlikely as it is because secularism is strongly rooted in turkey this risk cannot be entirely eliminated 
but there are in any democracy where extremist groups could divert the democratic process to achieve their ends 
the best way to prevent such a disaster is probably to strengthen the democratic system and for it to anchor turkey firmly in a bloc of countries them as democratic 
as for the european union it must decide whether it wants to be a christian club closed or instead an open society strengthened and enriched by its cultural and religious diversity 
turkey 's accession would provide a strong response with particular resonance in the muslim world 
the need to challenge the arguments against turkey 's membership of the fact that its benefits are rarely mentioned a single geopolitical position at the crossroads of the balkans of the south caucasus central asia and the middle east regions of vital importance for the security of europe a transit country for energy supply of military capacity at a time when the eu is in the process of putting its new european defence policy and a strong economic potential labor young and dynamic 
at the same time it must take account of the risks of rejection of turkey the likelihood of failure of the process of reforms that would enhance the extremist movements and would cause instability and political unrest at the doors of the eu 
turkey 's entry into the european union opens up broad prospects and comes challenges to overcome 
but the prospects are far superior 
the game of democracy 
in calcutta when a younger kid came along and insisted to take part in the game played my friends we let it go but only after having chuchoté in the ear of the other words 
when we were children it was important to control the cruel art of 
the technique of 
this applies to children and adults also applies to international institutions 
indeed the organisations which have formally committed to involve all nations in their decisions are often controlled by small groups of powerful nations while others are only make a mockery of participation 
the world trade organisation wto itself saying based on the principle of a country a vote sees in reality its agenda programmed in the wings by a small group of nations 
it is now common for the international organisations which publish a report all involve stakeholders and reflect their views 
the report is then evolutionary generally presented on a web site and all without exception ngos unions and other civil society organisations are invited to make suggestions 
this promotes a sense of participation but as a friend paid in these matters has taught me the secret is to finally ignore all the comments received and in drafting the report as if there was no website and as if any participation had been recorded 
increasingly the free expression of opinion influence or control the behaviour of the government 
take the united states 
americans have voiced their opinion freely in newspapers to television in the discussion forums on the internet on the war planned to george bush in iraq 
never before was there so much opposition to a war 
what happened or rather what has not happened is admirable almost no effort has been undertaken to muzzle critics of government , as is the case in china and in several countries dictatorial 
but the largest democracies in the world the united states india the uk etc are more adept at banning the opinions freely expressed aimed to restrict the actions of the government 
the war in iraq is perhaps the best evidence 
leave aside the immorality of the war and god knows how it is immoral i wish to draw attention to this growing ability and on the tendency of democracies to deal with so neutralise public opinion 
they have adopted the strategy of the 
when the mature democracies they become more than ever paid out in the management of opinion and in most cases in shaping the opinion 
every comment by hans blix on un inspections he led in iraq members of the bush administration paraphrasaient what blix said 
that paraphrase subtly alter of the comments of blix in order to support the arguments of america in favour of the war 
by repeating the comments airbrushed out the bush administration hoped that public opinion would agree with the war 
it can be difficult to reverse a regime totalitariste and hold elections but the toughest job is to transform the votes of the voters in a true democracy 
for individuals used to living in a totalitarian state this is not easy to learn the meaning of the term participation 
hence the popular belief that democracies such as wine improve over the age 
although this may be true maturity has its own disadvantage 
while citizens of a democracy continually learn to participate democratic governments continually learn to reach their goals despite the participation 
there is no denying that the civic participation all too often serves only to legitimise pretence 
we need to recognize and deal with this problem in order to prevent the established democracies of atrophy and in order to help the new democracies to become more efficient 
because it is not only morally wrong to leave of nations and communities feel marginalised and without a voice that is the best way to frustration rabies and terrorism 
redistribution of governance in asia 
the governance of the way in which decisions that affect the public interest are taken has become a key factor for determining the pace of development of a country a successful governance leads changes resolved 
the failures are punished by the unease dissatisfaction and stagnation 
the ten eight april will be held in bangkok a conference to discuss the prospects for improving governance in asia 
asian policymakers today must face an environment far different from that of their predecessors fifty years earlier 
the asian population has more than doubled since thousand nine hundred and fifty mainly in the poorest countries 
the political system in these countries was adapted for populations little important stable and rural 
today these companies must also manage urban centres extended that talent and multiple applications from the urban populations 
the world economy has also changed radically 
the increase in the flow of goods capital and knowledge in the world means that the foreign organisations and individuals have a greater influence further complicating the task of national governments concerned by the internal management of their own nations 
the international institutions such as the wto have changed frames of reference within which economic decisions are taken 
the changes in the local economies are also radicals 
in parts of asia levels of life soared 
foreign investment own external to the regions , or even have damaged the structure of the domestic economies 
the old models of economic growth , however , such as the orientation of exports or the selective use of import restrictions that produced satisfactory results in east asia in the last century are less well adapted to the new laws of international exchange 
so we need to create new rules of the game 
in most asian countries the official rules must be simplified and applied more fairly 
an approach to return to sources is essential in three related areas in which the national governments must take the direction the reduction of corruption the strengthening of property rights and the consistent application of legal principles 
few countries can score points in these areas 
the close links between the business world and governments have been accused of being responsible for the financial crises that have hit south asia is in thousand nine hundred four twenty ten seven 
in some parts of south asia violent conflicts and the power of the interests in place have endangered the legal principles 
the result of such failures is that the elites flourish while the mass suffers 
a clear structure of formal rules remains the best antidote to these failures because they reinforce the informal habits on which rely both companies 
the cases will not lead to court but in the meetings where the confidence and reputation are essential elements 
as the shows robert putnam social theorist social capital , the networks standards and social trust which facilitate cooperation and coordination to the benefit of all is as much a factor as a result of economic growth 
given the power to all members of civil society as possible door to instill more surely specific goals in the efforts to move the nations 
the government of the private sector and civil society all have a role to play in the strengthening of social capital 
but successful interactions between these sectors simply cannot be sought , without any input and it is essential that the role of everyone must clearly defined 
number of asian governments recognize the need to redefine their role more clearly 
following the crisis of thousand nine hundred four twenty ten seven governments have taken out a little more of the markets in recognition of the limits of their capacity to act and how it is important to let private entrepreneurship develop 
yet the governments have a role to play in the promotion of a favourable environment in which the markets can operate 
the control regulations and enforcement are two important ways but different work say through mixed partnerships between the public and the private sector which are increasingly used in many asian economies innovative 
the valuable role of civil society in the expression of community views that governments cannot achieve is also recognised but his relationship to the government and the business world is characterised more often by the conflict that cooperation 
the role of the private sector in the decision-making process , too , must often be clarified where the companies are too influential , compared to the governments their needs to operate benefit can lead to policies promoting the elites rather than the masses 
the metaphor of the game with its rules and its participants leads some to think in terms of international competition 
it is not very good since our interdependent world is not a zero-sum game where the gains of a nation represent the loss of another 
in fact the nations are not engaged in a competition the opponent each other as is the case for companies 
the trade represents a positive sum game where all countries benefit from the exploitation of their areas of comparative advantage 
good governance can improve this positive sum game and ensure that companies and individuals from these countries participate in profits 
it is in some way of thinking to governments as well as to entities entering competing providing a better service to their people that other governments 
what makes an important role in international comparisons systems 
in this spirit the conference of the unctad undp this month governance in asia underpinning competitiveness in a global economy governance in asia consolidate competitiveness in the global economy will bring together policymakers from across asia to discuss the challenges facing the governance must face in asia 
the role of the government , the only player to have the legitimacy of a popular mandate is fundamentally important in the direction of a nation moving forward 
the private sector and civil society , of course , are increasingly important partners for governments 
the functioning of relations between these participants deeply will influence the future of development in asia 
the ten eight brumaire of arnold schwarzenegger 
replace a governor that they had re-elected barely a year earlier by arnold schwarzenegger must have given to the californian voters an enormous pleasure although tinged with guilt 
some members of the opposition in germany would dearly love to do the same with chancellor gerhard schröder , although they have not yet 
found of film star to replace him 
several other european governments also know a certain unpopularity shortly after their election 
this situation is also true in non-eu countries such as the recently acclaimed brazilian president luis inacio lula da silva without talking about the south korean president to roh moo hyun who has called for a referendum to stop the decline in his popularity 
it would appear that nowadays the effects of the electoral success quickly fade 
each country must it therefore adopt a procedure of reminder to preserve the legitimacy of the governments 
absolutely not 
democracy to borrow the terms of the philosopher karl popper is defined by the ability to remove those who are in power without violence it is then under this definition a method by trial and error 
but the leaders must be given the chance to govern 
in fact , they have to have a chance to make mistakes as long as their decisions do not affect the foundations of the democratic order him even 
the method by trial and error involves the possibility of being wrong before try again 
the first mistake of californian voters on the attractiveness of the immediate future which is hardly surprising in a state where the immediate satisfaction is itself saying a fundamental value 
but this desire sometimes seems damning in democracies post modern all the countries of the world 
indeed democracy today has adopted a pop culture of fads which disappear as fast as they came the pop group the hysterical fans today will be forgotten tomorrow and there are plenty of others that are waiting in the wings 
in politics this situation can be dangerous because it encourages speedy decisions whatever their importance according to popular opinion that prevails momentarily 
the call for an increased number of referendums reflects and fuels this trend 
the referendums are mostly snapshots 
switzerland with his pace usually slower and its in-depth political debate before the elections is probably the only exception to this rule 
in general the referendums use to measure the popularity of political leaders at a given moment whatever the problem at stake 
if and when britain will decide on the adoption of the euro it is more likely that the outcome of this vote we learn all sorts of things on tony blair and on the european union but very little on the merits of the common currency 
the arguments in favour of a representative government not inconsiderable remain 
democracy is to govern organising debates taking important decisions after in-depth deliberations that at least in the big countries must be conducted in a parliament by elected representatives 
the parliaments wish sometimes act quickly and they may be forced to do so , but in general they take enough time to examine the issues in the detail 
the parliaments speak before forming the conclusions of where their name 
take the case of germany country in which some leaders of the group of christians opposition democrats burn of desire to reduce the government schröder negate 
obviously the proposed reforms and already partly enacted by the government are unpopular and there is little doubt that a year after his re-election the coalition of social democrats and the greens did very little chance to convince the polls 
but who can know what the voters will think in three years ago when the government 's mandate will end 
by the next election voters with the decline could realise that there was no real alternative to the policies of schröder and it may even be expected that the beneficial effects of these painful reforms their become apparent by then 
the leaders need time to take and apply both unpopular decisions that popular 
they need courage to lead to parliamentary majorities precarious often on the road to popularity with ups and downs 
that is why they are forced to take the measures the more painful during their first year in office , and then radoucir to the approach of the next election 
the partnership precarious of prime minister tony blair and the finance minister gordon brown perfectly illustrates this kind of tactic 
the leaders who will never their popularity are not worthy of their position 
california has also demonstrated the bad example and californians will probably have to pay a high price for their mistake 
it will , however , probably not as high as paid by france a century and a half ago when louis napoleon elected by universal suffrage has transformed through a referendum excessively popular in napoleon three this vote is the last in france until the end of the second empire 
californians , of course , will not be deprived of the right to vote but their stubbornness may generate a form unpredictable and irresponsible of state policy 
it is certain that democracy implies a limited duration in the time during which the powerful of this world must be able to exercise their power without dissent 
a functioning democracy must give them enough time to win the accession of elected representatives to legislate and to apply their programme 
these two imperatives are inherently contradictory but a representative parliamentary democracy is still the best way to ensure the balance between the two 
anything else would be as stable as the ten best pop songs this week 
herbert hoover and the stability pact 
in the middle of july the good and great finance ministers of the member countries of the european monetary union emu met to discuss the economic situation in the euro zone 
they ruminated over the most recent economic forecast which projects annual gdp growth in the eurozone this year at a pathetically anemic zero comma seven % 
then , with the exception of a single minister they have all decided that their economy was to suffer a little of this obscenity or worse 
they have reaffirmed their commitment to the stability and growth pact , which calls for the euro zone countries tax increases and cuts in public expenditure increasing the pressure on their economy 
this pact is already pushing germany to the recession the italian government struggles to revise its growth forecasts quickly enough not to be overtaken by an index of production failing 
yet this does not seem enough to force the official to review their priorities 
some european finance ministers still consider the stability pact as the cornerstone of emu 
others talk of the importance of adhere to the rule of the game 
still others argue that recovery must be done in the spirit of the pact , even if it remains essential to restore economic growth 
view of the other side of the atlantic all these reasons seem extremely strange 
the last time that the us government has tried to ensure a balanced budget despite the recession it was seventy years under herbert hoover 's presidency at the beginning of the great depression 
since a broad consensus has established in the united states on the cycles of economic depression which require the use of fiscal deficits to relieve the suffering stimulate demand general and rush the recovery 
economists call these cycles of tax bursts of automatic stabilisers 
when household incomes fall the same is true of the income of the public sector 
tax cuts can increase disposable income 
but mainly when household incomes fall social spending of the government increase triggering the recovery in demand from production of investment and employment 
the lower taxes and increasing spending broaden the budget deficit but soundly and effective 
the american side of the atlantic the usefulness of these fiscal stabilisers is not challenged 
on the contrary to every recession threatens political debate revolves around their strengthening by pulses 
not more than it is a question of fiscal discipline 
every time that proposals to amend the constitution to balance the budget have surfaced the proposals have always offered exceptions not only in the event of war but also in recession 
we know the origins of the stability and growth pact 
the countries of northern europe , particularly germany and the netherlands are always keen to maintain a report low between their debt and their gdp and interest rates relatively low 
when these countries have found that the southern european countries italy and greece particularly had usual a report high between their debt and their gdp and nominal interest rate quite high because of their tolerance visible against inflation 
the countries of northern europe feared that the deficits of the south can create finally pressure on the partial monetarisation their debt through inflation of the euro or more precisely their leaders feared that investors scared for the same reasons require higher interest rates 
the stability and growth pact was intended to keep the debt of the countries of the southern europe to low levels thus keeping interest rates low enough to reassure investors about the fact that the national debt would never be allowed to rise to the point of generating inflationary pressure serious 
yet if you look at the economic problems of the euro zone today the threat of nominal interest rate high in the long term is certainly not part of the ten main concerns investors 
at worst , investors do not fear that a high debt governments to slow inflation in actionnant printing money 
the problems of the european union come from an index of production averaging high structural unemployment , low productivity growth a common agricultural policy unnecessary and unfair and the forecast structural adjustments to the expansion of the european union even 
to a certain point of view it is good that the euro zone finance ministers are ready to maintain their national debt to the lowest in the long term it is a sign that the victories on inflation won in the years thousand nine hundred seventy will not be purely and simply ignored 
but it is dangerous to fixated on the past 
there is no safer road towards economic disaster than those of historical blinkers 
as in show herbert hoover , when we do not believe that the economic problems of the previous generation we may not see the dangers that are directly under our eyes 
the ghosts of past our economy 
in the famous novel by charles dickens has christmas carol singing a christmas ebeneezer scrooge a businessman without soul is harassed by the spirit of christmas past 
now economists are similarly disturbed by ghosts undesirable when they think about the resurgence of economic ills that were believed to be dead and buried long 
whether stephen roach of morgan stanley or paul krugman of princeton the governors of the american federal reserve or anyone else in japan economists in the world are concerned about deflation 
their concerns date back the thread of economic thought of fifty years time when economists had discovered that the only thing to do against deflation was to avoid it like the plague 
in a thousand nine hundred thirty three irving fisher milton friedman 's predecessor at the head of school american monetarist announced that governments could prevent deep depressions in avoiding deflation 
deflation the steady ongoing decline in prices encouraged the world of business and consumers cut their spending and hoard cash 
this reduces the ability of shops and banks to repay their debts and can trigger a series of bankruptcies enormous destroying confidence in the financial system , which then feeds the fear and herding 
such encouragement to accumulate rather than to spend maintain the request to the lowest , and always downwards while unemployment grows and grows over a period of time very long that even politicians and economists who defend hard the policies laissez faire cannot accept 
so is that the keynesian solution use monetary policies lower interest rates and fiscal inflation of public spending and cut taxes to keep the economy away from the abyss that makes deflation possible 
yet if this issue was settled over fifty years earlier why is it haunt us 
why is t it a threat that worries both japan today and is worrying in the united states 
at the end of the ' thousand nine hundred and forty those who présidèrent to the creation of an international economic order after war tried to create an international monetary system that has enough would stabilise the exchange rate for producers and consumers outside the dangers of excessive fluctuations and irrational of exchange rates b would allow nations to develop their own macroeconomic policies and c can warn catastrophic panics which not only affect the banks and individuals but also the entire nations who produced the international financial crisis destructive of the great depression 
this result in the creation of a system where bretton wood exchange rates are fixed but adjusted that became over the years the system floating years thousand nine hundred four vingts 
then came the years thousand nine hundred four twenty ten 
all of a sudden financial crises incredibly destructive réapparurent following the popular panic in mexico in thailand in korea in brazil etc and looked like the financial panic of american thousand eight hundred sixty thirteen or to the crisis in the austrian creditanstalt thousand nine hundred thirty one 
argentina 's crisis at the end of the year two thousand a looked extraordinary way to argentina of baring brothers in thousand eight hundred four twenty ten if that politicians and international bankers seemed to have a much better idea of what to do to minimize the damage that they do not seem to have today 
and if those who bâtirent the international monetary system after war worked to put in place of guard crazy to protect us of the dangers of the international financial crisis created by the popular panics why this kind of crisis is returning it today 
the truth is that the economic policies familiar with a whole range of possible disasters confuse anyone who seems most threatening for anyone who seems most distant 
in the united states , the bush administration remains skeptical of the stimulative power of monetary policy and wants big fiscal deficits to reduce unemployment hoping that the future dangers posed by persistent deficits investment weakened sluggish growth loss of confidence uncontrollable inflation and exchange rate depreciation can be finessed , or will not be visible until after the departure of the bush team presidency 
in europe , the european central bank believes that the danger of a uncontrolled inflation following a loss of public confidence in its commitment to low inflation outweighs the cost of unemployment which is still too high 
in developing countries the capital controls to prevent financial crises is seen as an obstacle to the attraction of the capital needed to industrialization and as a potential source of corruption since the financial flows spend in one way or another in the hands of the nephew by alliance of vice finance minister 
flexible exchange rates designed to allow markets to indicate the loss of confidence in the currency also put exporters in a competitive situation difficult compared to producers of foreign countries whose prices have been battered by exchange rate little predictable 
even the substitution policies of imports today were adopted much criticised originally by developing countries for good and bad reasons the closure " protectionist markets of developed countries during the great depression would have disastrous consequences on the economies of developing countries 
the ghosts of past our economy back because the lessons of this are still saturated 
politicians and policymakers put forward their economic approach as the one and only doctrine 
but what they do in fact is to manage the most important issues of the day at the expense of the disappearance of institutions and policies put in place by their predecessors to control of the problems they received as the most pressing 
the visitors night ebeneezer scrooge were able to convince him that it was wrong and to open our eyes on its mistakes 
hope that economists today will also the lesson of their unwanted ghosts

justification for humanitarian intervention 
i have visited the former soviet republics of central asia thousand nine hundred four twenty ten eight in order to take part in talks on democratic development which took place or which was due to take place in these newly independent countries 
my hosts were former communist leaders now that assumed the role of more or less democratically elected presidents 
each of them spoke without constraints of institutions democratic procedures and respect for the law 
but human rights were a completely separate issue 
i have presented in each country , a list of political prisoners by asking what was their fate 
in one country the president has immediately decided to release a man accused of plotting a coup 
but even this apparent success was morally ambiguous 
the president had not taken a political decision he had given a personal favour 
i had received a gift in him even just another demonstration of the arbitrary exercise of power of the president and not a sign of respect of moral principles 
in a single country i have discussed with a leader of the opposition islamic fundamentalist which was launched in a long civil war against the government 
this man fancied himself president of the committee of national reconciliation 
armed guards to the teeth him when he strongly supported the notion of democratisation 
indeed he considered this notion as the surest way to power because the vast majority of the population thought exactly like him 
democracy implied it more worrying he would eliminate it did not elaborate on the exact meaning of this term the population opposed to his ideas 
in democracies deprived of democrats it is even more complicated to discuss human rights that procedural formalities because these rights are not considered the rights in the legal sense but simply as access of conscience or as gifts in exchange for another valuable asset 
this distinction is particularly important because it draws attention to the limited effectiveness of official legal standards as a means of promoting human rights 
this gap between human rights and the behaviour of leaders has led to the most important change ever occurred in the conduct of international affairs of our time the advent of humanitarian intervention 
this change is initially produced outside the established international institutions and the un system taking its origin of the french group doctors without borders who believed that human rights were a value more important than national sovereignty 
doctors without borders has introduced the concept of right to intervene in the humanitarian disasters bypassing the restrictions of the classical international law 
the international system has also quickly adopted and transformed this notion and several humanitarian interventions 
the nato intervention in kosovo is a precedent which the secretary of state colin powell has used to justify the war with iraq 
but if convincing as either the cause of a military humanitarian intervention such actions should be taken under the aegis of the un charter 
after all the promotion of human rights has been the guiding principle of the establishment of the un 
its task in this area has been declared in the universal declaration of human rights of thousand nine hundred and forty eight in the helsinki accords of thousand nine hundred sixty 15 which lent human rights legal supremacy on the sovereignty of individual states 
however , there is a blatant contradiction between the universality and the supremacy of human rights and the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of member states who are also an integral part of the un documents 
one way to overcome this contradiction is to introduce in the un charter a new chapter dedicated to human rights and to reformulate the chapter four of the use of force in international relations 
the principle of sovereignty must also be redefined in him even 
the world needs a system of legal orders bilateral and multilateral agreements institutions of control and supervision appropriate to regulate the use of force for humanitarian reasons 
the legal restrictions on humanitarian intervention are necessary because the dictators use it too often to justify a criminal aggression 
adolf hitler has drawn up its strategy when it has dismantled czechoslovakia itself saying to defend the sudeten germans and later when it invaded my homeland poland 
as has again demonstrated milosevic in the years thousand nine hundred four twenty ten when he was trying to defend the innocent serbs in croatia and bosnia justify the military intervention solely on the basis of moral principles leaves too much free rein to distort these principles and abuse 
that is why the debates on the reform of the security council should focus not on the modification of its membership , but on its mission 
the council must be made explicit responsible for the safety of the man and its protection in addition to his current role of safeguarding of more traditional notions of international security 
the principle of not intervening in the internal affairs of a state has never been absolute and globalisation presents this principle with a radical challenge 
the term international relations assume an order westphalien commitments among of sovereign nations who has replaced the medieval order of communities defined by the personal allegiance to a king 
but the next westphalien today is in decline and the significance of the state borders
