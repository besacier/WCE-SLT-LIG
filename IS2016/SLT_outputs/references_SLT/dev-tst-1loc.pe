The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were outraged Mr Camus said
I have heard about a possible legal action to come he said
Jean Claude Camus estimated that Johnny Hallyday had left far too fast to Los Angeles with the permission from the Parisian surgeon
I had this doctor personally on the phone who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and I was amazed given that I have had myself two spinal disc herniations he added
Shortly before on RTL he had indicated that the singer had apparently left without a drain without anything after his operation in Paris
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in show business
He operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death in a clinic in Neuilly sur Seine where he worked at the time
In 2007 he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage
But he is also a doctor with a dodgy reputation who was repeatedly condemned by the justice system in medical liability cases as well as for tax fraud and swindling
Olivier Metzner Esq the lawyer for the national medical society accused him of being a man without scruples pursued regularly before the organization s Council and someone who is far from being recommendable
After several days of silence Dr Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer David Koubbi
He indicated that the operation went perfectly well and the post operative tests were normal
The operation was not haemorrhagic and therefore didn t need to put a drain he added
In any event the singer s tour whose health problems have increased since this summer appears in parentheses
Quite evidently a resumption of the Tour on January 8th in Amiens as planned seems much too soon said Mr Camus
The UDF association increases the tone and commands the new centre to stop using its acronym
The UDF association controlled by François Bayrou MoDem responded Friday to the takeover attempt of the president of the New Centre Hervé Morin on the symbol of the former Giscardian party requiring him to do not use it on any material back up at the risk of prosecution
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF acronym judging that François Bayrou does not deserve to defend its political legacy after reaching out towards the left wing
The defence minister whose party is a partner of the UMP had also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC
To press its approach he received Hervé de Charette s support of ex UMP now in NC which claims UDF copywrite for being the first to deposit it in 2004 in the National Institute of Industrial Property
But on Friday evening the Bureau of the UDF Association controlled by friends of François Bayrou who do not want to lose has come out of its silence to launch a formal notice to the minister and to the deputy demanding that they stop the use of the acronym and that they transfer the ownership of the brand under threat of prosecution
You have increased in recent days statements indicating that you were going to propose to your political movement to resume using the acronym UDF wrote the association in a letter signed by 19 of 24 board members including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem as well as Senator John Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance
You have also seen fit to place on your militant material and on the home page of your site the name of this movement the New Center and the slogan the UDF today the signatories of the letter also note
As you know you have no right to use this symbol explains the UFD office which calls on the NC to stop immediately the use of the UFD name for any credibility as well as of its internet site
He also asks Hervé de Charette to pass on the property of the brand to its legitimate copyright holders
If you did not do it courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF warn the signatories
In their letter they specify that UDF is an independent political movement since 1978 and argued that Mr Morin and his friends made the choice to leave it in 2007 to create a competitor party like others did in 2002 to create UMP
The new centre therefore did not have according to them any right to use the acronym UDF Union for French democracy
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its membership to the modem for three years and creating an office in charge of defending the material and moral interests of education founded by Valery Giscard d Estaing
As for Hervé de Charette is pursuing the bureau when he established the brand he was more unites the UDF for three years but the UMP
He takes advantage outrageously and fraudulently of the absence of file of the UDF acronym to file it on his behalf
This unscrupulousness is in the process of turning into crime they proclaimed before mocking the strategy of the NC It would seem to us that in politics as in life it is worthier to make a name for oneself than to try to escape anonymity by fraudulently taking a name one has no right to
Liliane Bettencourt affair françois marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness
The court in Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist François Marie Banier to determine if as accused by the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt he took advantage of the weakness of the octogenarian to steal part of her fortune
The photographer of 62 years known for his photos of stars will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness a criminal offence with a maximum sentence of three years imprisonment and 375 000 euros fine
This decision means that there will indeed be a trial in this case worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France where mother and daughter have been ripping each other apart while holding the reins of the L Oréal cosmetics empire
But the 15th criminal court has also ordered that a medical expertise to Liliane Bettencourt 87 years old should be led collectively by three doctors
The heir and main shareholder of L Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination not anyway under the terms proposed by the public prosecutor of Nanterre during the investigation
The doctors named on Friday must submit a report before March 10 2010 particularly saying whether Liliane Bettencourt could have been in a weakened state and during what periods
I think she will submit it
I am going to talk to her about it Mrs Bettencourt s lawyer Georges Kiejman said at the exit of the hearing
For his part the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt Meyers Olivier Metzner welcomed the court s decision
This is excellent news The expertise will show that he Mr Banier has manipulated this elderly lady who must be protected he said
For two years now the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has engaged in criminal proceedings against François Marie Banier photographer and jack of all trades artist whom she accuses of having benefited for years from her mother s weakness to obtain a billion Euros worth of gifts in the form of checks life insurance policies and paintings by the Old Masters
On her side Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer that she considers as a long time friend
While the court should examine the admissibility of the action by Mrs Bettencourt Meyers the lawyers pleadings turned sometimes into the big family outpouring on Friday
Thus the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt indicated three letters sent by her in 1999 2003 and 2005 to her notary in which she was saying she was wary of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt Meyers
In the letter of 2003 Liliane Bettencourt added according to the lawyer Please explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier once twice a day for 15 years
Françoise I have never been able to speak to him since his marriage
For his part the prosecutor of Nanterre once again judged that the plaintiff was not able to act all the more because a guardianship judge declined in recent days to grant her request for an order of protection for her mother
Liliane Bettencourt has the full ability to act justly she is not under protection and has no guardian
Nobody else has to act in her place said the representative of the Crown Marie Christine Daubigney
The court decided finally that it would pronounce itself once the trial will take place on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt Meyers
Managerial revolution or end of business intelligence
If nothing changes in the governance of the big French companies our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been vain
For more than a decade the attitude of the management of large companies with respect to its employees recalls the position of companies with respect to the consumers before the marketing revolution it is about making the staff adhere to values determined from on high as it was about in the past of imposing on the consumer products conceived by factory technicians
By putting the customer at the heart of the company the marketing revolution has put the strategies of market conquest in place although the authoritarian temptation to impose products unrelated to factors of customer preference returns regularly
Demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demoralization
Suicides at France Telecom PSA or Renault are only the visible part of a much more general phenomenon which hits particularly managers
These layoffs seriously threaten the development of all of the company s intellectual functions including R D and even more its business intelligence
Indeed the IE requires of all the stakeholders a proactive approach and a forward looking vision it needs employees to make a commitment that the recipes of an authoritarian management authoritarian completely frustrate
This is why we call for a managerial revolution which would involve putting the staff at the center of the company s concerns to the same degree as the clients
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls
The investigation of domestic opinion likes the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees will it encourage this revolution in managerial practices
Unfortunately I m afraid not
First because I was able to note that in a new situation any structure finally ends up after many detours in doing primarily what it has always done
Then because authoritarianism one of the diseases of power grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures
Finally because most of the leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour
Coming from the great schools of engineers they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology
They are adopting out of intellectual comfort the old behaviorist theory recently reactivated by American neuroscience and widely aired without its knowledge by learning institutions and the media
Thus suggesting that it is possible to handle the levers sic of executives involvement a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro fr is it reinforces the leaders in a mechanistic governance position inappropriate for the actual world
Identify and measure the causes of mobilization
Instead the managerial revolution necessary to the good functioning of modern companies requires them to adopt a finalist vision of human behaviour
It is to include in any reasoning or practice of governance a fundamental observation for employees the commitment to the company is only possible if it is clear that the latter is a means of achieving part of their dreams their ambitions their projects
Currently only the studies arising from the Multifunctional Analysis adopt this conception of the motives of the employees
These studies have shown that they judge their company based on predetermined popular opinion which allows them through their perceived image of the company to assess what it offers them for the realization of their lifetime plans
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of the mobilisation factors business managers can control foreshadow and anticipate their social performance and put their human resources s management back on the right track
Thus they create a breeding ground for a concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence
Oslo speech the just war brings praises from the right to Obama
The American right welcomed on Friday the speech given the evening before in Oslo by Barack Obama pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize winner of 2009 had defended the concept of a just war against the enemies of the United States
The Conservatives who had ridiculed awarding the prize to Mr Obama on October 9th applauded this time the presidential speech like Sarah Palin former candidate for the vice presidency during the 2008 elections
I liked what he said said Mrs Palin the muse of the right wing of the Republican Party in the daily newspaper USA Today adding that she herself had addressed the sometimes necessary subject of the war in her memoirs which have just been published
War is obviously the last thing in my opinion that Americans want to but it is necessary
We must stop these terrorists over there she felt
Mr Obama who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan dedicated himself Thursday in Oslo to justifying the use of force a way to explain his decision to send 30 000 additional troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier
Another opponent of Mr Obama Newt Gingrich has estimated that the president has done a very good job in Oslo
I found the speech very good welcomed the former president of the House of Representatives who has particularly appreciated the mention of The existence of evil in the world in the presidential statement
In some parts I found this speech quite historic said Mr Gingrich interviewed during the radio programme The Takeaway
The former elected official regarded by some as a candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012 said that he was delighted to have seen a president from the left remind members of the Nobel Committee that they would not be free and could not put a price on peace if the recourse to force did not exist
For Michael Gerson a former George W Bush press member turned Washington Post columnist Mr Obama gave a very American speech
In addition to representing himself as a citizen of the world as he always does he spoke as an American president reminding the Europeans that they live in a bubble of security that they have not created and that they don t do much to preserve it Mr Gerson said
Among the few on the right not to be convinced a hawk in the Bush era former UN Ambassador John Bolton described the speech as being dull turgid and lacking inspiration on the National Review Online site
To the left of the president the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force
When one connects the war with the notion of justice it is easy to justify the killing of innocent people he warned
The centre left press remained however laudatory toward the president
The Los Angeles Times while continuing to think that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr Obama has described his speech as superproduction even for an orator known for his talent
The speech in Oslo should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against wars poverty and oppression the California daily flared
Mr Obama gave the speech he must deemed the New York Times judging it bleak and edifying at the same time
Reutirs three marathons for an agreement which saves the Christmas supplies
After three marathon sessions of negotiations the unions of the road sector and TLF only employer organization to have stayed until the end have reached an agreement on Friday evening that puts an end to the slogans of strike and to the threat weighing on the Christmas supplies
In the signatories meeting on Friday evening Dominique Bussereau the Secretary of State for Transport was delighted with this agreement which was reached after several negotiating sessions that started on Wednesday morning
After a second night of debate the negotiators left in the early morning on Friday with the hope to sign soon after the late morning the text of agreement
Even if three employers organisations FNTR Unostra OTRE have closed the door
But it took still more than six hours of a meeting began at 11 a m so that everyone agree and that at 6 p m the text is signed
The conflict would have been very damaging for the companies and it was feared that it will disrupt the Christmas holidays parties said Mr Bussereau
The text provides a salary increase of 4 for the lowest wages in the local and regional road transport and 2 9 for the highest ones international road transport
In the hourly rate for low earners we re going from 8 72 euros to 9 06
It is not much but we start very far away said Patrice Clos FO
Tonight we will order to our activists that there was no obstacles no blockade of the supplies centres
But there may still be some holdouts who are not happy he added
Philippe grillot president of TLF welcomed a good agreement even if it was difficult to concede the increases on the senior salaries because of international competition
According to him the increases will be around 170 Euro per month for low wages and from 100 to 120 Euro for the highest ones
It is the agreement of common sense and respect of employees Maxime Dumont CFDT said while Thierry Douine CFTC welcomed a historic agreement
As for him Richard Jaubert CGT has come up with an acceptable compromise
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of travel expenses by 3 and maintaining the general state of road transport till the first half of 2010 which will make it possible to address the issue of a 13th month and modernization of the collective agreement
Mr Bussereau reminded that a drop of 100 million euros in employers contributions was the subject of a governmental amendment to the financial bill reform for 2009 voted in the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly
The government will ask the Senate to vote it in identical term
The signing of TLF allows that the agreement applies in the first instance to companies belonging to this organisation and in the second instance to the entire profession in case of an extension by the Minister of Labour
It will be in the shortest possible time assured Mr Bussereau
The opposition of employers organisations can only delay the process
The FNTR denounced a fool s market because the 100 million euros had already been promised for the sector to offset some of the carbon tax
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency not in conclusion to a shared analysis but not to upset the turkey eaters for the next Christmas Eve the Unostra complained
For the Otre the agreement risks digging the grave of a very large number of small and medium sized businesses in the next 12 months
RER A disruption this weekend trade unions unhappy with the RATP s proposals
The disruptions on the RER A the biggest line of urban public transportation in France are going to continue during the weekend while a meeting Friday on the second day of the strike between the unions and management of the RATP has left them unsatisfied as to their demand for a bonus
On Saturday and Sunday during this important shopping weekend before Christmas there will only be trains between 10 00 a m and 8 p m with a train out of two on the central section between La Défense and Nation and a train out of four outside the central section
The interconnection with SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Préfecture which will force passengers to change trains
The Galeries Lafayette who expect 200 000 customers every day were delighted that the RATP is making efforts to serve the department stores
The RER A crosses the city of Paris from West to East
The RATP section runs from Saint Germain en Laye and Nanterre to Boissy Saint Léger and Marne la Vallée
On Friday about a train out of two circulated at peak times and almost no train off peak as planned
Like Thursday there was no melee on the dock since the Franciliens had organised themselves
And in the morning the station of Saint Germain en Laye Yvelines was much less crowded than usual particularly because of the absence of schoolboys and secondary school pupils
At Boissy Saint Léger Val de Marne Jack Nbakina an engineer for 29 years explained that he got up an hour and a half earlier to be sure to arrive on time
The Saint Lazare station has not been saturated said the SNCF which had provided a management of agents and policemen
RER A operated by SNCF from or to Cergy le Haut arrived or went to Saint Lazare station to join the tube
New general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday which will examine the results found to be disappointing by the trade unions there is a meeting with management on Friday afternoon
The RER director proposes to negotiate a special protocol for the RER A on all aspects working time career development etc
This is not what the drivers wanted who demand a due allowance according to Thierry Garon South
The RATP has even put to one side its premium proposals cried out the CGT stressing that the management was not able to solve a problem while it s done for the truck drivers and the SNCF
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for a broader examination of the working conditions the RATP said
That also made the trade unions say that the company was making fun of users of the weekend
In the course of the morning some 150 drivers had invaded a committee of establishment at the headquarters in Paris
This is when the leadership which previously refused any discussion during the strike had suggested for the sake of appeasement the meeting
The conflict threatens to widen to the RER B on Tuesday after a warning by UNSA and Indépendants
The trade unions ask for a bonus of 120 euros UNSA to 150 euros with EUR 30 variable CGT FO CFDT South Indépendants and complain of the deterioration of the working conditions on that one million daily passengers line
The drivers of the RER all in the second part of careers have from 2 200 to 2 700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros in premiums for staggered hours Sundays and holidays
The Turkish justice dissolved the pro Kurdish party a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the dissolution of the main pro Kurdish party of the country a decision that was immediately followed by expressions of anger by the Kurdish community in the south east and Istanbul
This decision is likely to greatly complicate the task of the government which has just reached out to the Kurdish community to try to put an end to 25 years of conflict
The Democratic Society Party DTP was dissolved because it had become a hotbed of activities prejudicial to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity the President of the Court Hasim Kiliç told the press after four days of deliberations
The decision was unanimous in the 11 judges while a qualified majority of seven was required to make the dissolution said Mr Kiliç adding that 37 party seniors including its president Ahmet Türk and member of Parliament Aysel Tugluk are banned from politics for five years
The judge has also announced the parliamentary immunity closure which was enjoyed by Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluk and confiscated party s assets by the Treasury
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament out of 550
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that members would be moving out of the Parliament rather than sitting as parliament members without a party
The decision follows a process triggered in 2007 by the Court of Cassation s prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya which accuses the DTP to obey directives of the Kurdistan Workers Party PKK considered as a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels
The party assures however that it has no organic link with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and calls for the government to negotiate with it
The court s verdict comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights to try to stop the Kurds support of the PKK and put an end to the conflict
The leaders of the DTP had said that a dissolution could lead to an escalation of tensions in the Anatolian south east where many demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks
Upon the announcement of the judgment a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP in Diyarbakir the big city in the south east populated by a majority of Kurds
The police fired tear gas grenades and used water cannons while demonstrators launched Molotov cocktails or stones with slings
One hundred people marched also in Istanbul
After the verdict Mr türk insisted that the court ruling would deepen despair
Turkey cannot solve this issue Kurdish Ed by banning a party he said to the press
The government formed by a party stemming from the Islamist movement has also deplored the decision
We are opposed by principle to the closure of parties
This does not solve anything minister of Energy Taner Yildiz said
This decision is a complete undermining of the democratic overtures launched by the government political analyst Ahmet Insel commented You could I suppose use torpedoing if you prefer
We can expect of course a reaction from the PKK he added
On Thursday the PKK has claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey one of the most lethal in recent months
The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang brauburger wishes is a very harsh winter
But the road winter services manager FES precises clearly that this is not to annoy people
This is simply so that the agents can test the vehicles and learn to control them
According to meteologists that could be for this weekend
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to tackle the snow and ice
The FES follows a very elaborate plan
Mr Brauburger explains that when it starts to snow on Frankfurt city and temperatures are below zero winter services vehicles travel 20 main roads nicknamed A roads
That includes the streets with a great deal of traffic the main arteries such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße
Also included are access for the firefighters the routes of public transport the pedestrian areas and the sloping streets as the Atzelbergstraße
The agents of the FES begin their service at three in the morning
If necessary the 1 040 kilometers of roadway must be salted with a road surfacing material which adheres well in 3 hours at the maximum
This is why works at FES begin at 3 o clock in the morning so that the roads are clear when the daily traffics begins
Where it is becoming more difficult it is when the snow starts falling at 7 30 in the morning
This is causing problems the head of the road clearing and sanding service says to us because no driver is willing to let the salting vehicles pass by
Then if it does not snow anymore we deal with the access roads and the feeder roads like the Rat Beil Straße
Secondary roads and side streets come last
Mr Brauburger knows that it always causes a few complaints
At 5 a m the pedestrian FES team is in motion to clear first those zones deemed dangerous and passages
As to the bicycle paths the FES services cannot usually take care of them
Mr brauburger specifies that there is in Frankfurt a service special that deals to monitor the state bridges between 22 00 and 4 30
Since the ice forms very quickly on these surfaces the salting vehicles act as soon as the temperature falls below 2 degrees
It also happens that the police call for help from this special service when it is needed
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae looked like the other carnivorous dinosaurs this biped measured approximately 2 meters long by 1 50 m high its rear limbs were powerful its elongated skull was equipped with sharp and curved teeth its short arms ended in sickle claws and it had a long tail
If this species had lived a few million years later she would not have had anything outstanding
But as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues report it in the magazine Science on Thursday the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological features
This animal was living 215 million years ago in New Mexico which was then part of the emerged lands of the supercontinent Pangea and was near the equator
Sertling Nesbitt said that the discovery of Tawa sheds new light on the evolution of the first dinosaurs
Indeed he informs us about the relationship the distribution and the characteristics of these last
It s in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt has undertaken searches with other paleontologists on the Gohst Crawford ranch site in northern New Mexico
Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah a member of the excavation team tells how they sometimes found about a dozen skeletal remains in a single day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating back to the Triassic Period
The scientists realised very quickly that a portion of these bones belonged to a new species
The excavations have revealed the remains of five specimens
A discovery which confirms theories about the beginning of the evolution of dinosaurs
Researchers have named it Tawa after the word of the Hopi Indians for the Sun God
For Sterling Nesbitt it is a quite exceptional discovery the fossils of dinosaurs from Trias are extremely rare and limited to a few fragments of incomplete bones
Not all the experts in palaeontology share this enthusiasm
For example Martin Sander from the University of Bonn does not find this discovery particularly spectacular but he adds that it allows us to confirm some theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs
According to current knowledge dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago
Most of the older fossils however are fragmented and incomplete which makes the classification of the very first dinosaurs a very difficult process
The experts are wondering amongst each other during which period the saurians divided into three major evolutionary groups the théropods carnivores which include the tyrannosaurus and the velociraptor that appeared later on and from which the birds descended the sauropods four legged with a long neck and those that are related to them and the ornithischian herbivores of which species such as the triceratops and stegosaurus are part
According to research conducted by S Nesbitt et al Tawa is one of the first theropods
This species presents an interesting ratio of features both primitive and developed S Nesbitt said
Researchers have found signs which suggests that the Tawa hallae had small air bags in his bones near the skull as have the birds that are the descendants of theropods
These small pockets of air facilitate the breathing of birds compared to mammals
It seems that in the Tawa hallae the vertebrae were partially filled with air
According to Randall Irmis the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air bags in his bones
Since the descendants of the immense sauropods also had hollow backbones with air sacs in them one might think that their common ancestor already had that beneficial innovation
Three successive waves of migration to North America
As the most primitive known dinosaurs had lived in South America researchers concluded that the saurian had appeared over there
Consequently the three main lines of evolution divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world that is to say the whole of the emerged land which formed the Pangee supercontinent
It seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of palaeontologists has also discovered the remains of two other theropods which are not particularly related to it
The three species can not descend from a common ancestor that would have migrated the researchers argue
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History of New York and co author of the magazine Science Studies said that there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America
Of course there are a few contradictions
Martin Sander paleontologist in Bonn said that there exists an even older species the Silesaurus that lived in present day Poland and that belongs to a group related to dinosaurs
According to him that could give a distorted view because there is in South America a large number of dinosaur fossils that have been preserved while one finds virtually none on other continents
However how the dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetrapods of the Jurassic era when they belong to a relatively rare branch of cousins to the reptiles is still a mystery
During Trias dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles such as the ancestors of present day crocodiles and many other lizards
Towards the end of Trias dinosaurs spread across the globe promoting the development of many new species while others that were related to them disappeared between Trias and Jurassic
Such a success is however not eternal
To explain this transformation Martin Sander sees two hypotheses
There may have been a mass extinction to which dinosaurs survived randomly whereas other reptiles disappeared
Or the dinosaurs were better suited and so they could eliminate the competition on the ground
In any case such a success is not eternal
150 million years later the fall of a meteorite fostered the development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Triassic and that since this time were vegetating in the shadows it was mammals
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world
There are the ones from teachers of the University of Toronto the University of Cambridge the University of Vienna or of Berkeley in California
There are those of lecturers of the University of Naples Quebec Edinburgh New York São Paulo Berlin or Bremen
The evacuation by the police of the casino of the J W Goethe University in Frankfurt made waves around the world
278 professors and other teachers from the J W Goethe University but also from other institutions of higher education in Germany Europe and North and South America expressed their solidarity with the student protesters of the Westend Campus
In a statement written in German and English they were condemning the intervention of the police requested by the executive committee of the university
Last week University President Werner Müller Estler evacuated the buildings occupied by the striking students and teachers after graffiti had been scrawled on walls and works of art
Five students were injured during the evacuation
The signatories believe that the damage did not justify such violence from the police squad against the students and teachers who had organized their own courses
The evacuation is an unacceptable breach of the freedom of research and education
Focusing the attention exclusively on vandalism acts serves only to delegitimize and criminalize the protest and is trying to make forget the mobilisation s reasons
The Managing Committee of the University has thus evaded the debates that would be yet necessary
Lecturers requires that the ongoing criminal prosecution should be suspended immediately
The majority of the occupants did not take part in the vandalism
Legitimation of the protests
Young people from trade union Verdi of services sector and the German Confederation of Unions DGB show solidarity with students
The protests are only the legitimate expression of a growing concern for our own future said Alexander Klein regional secretary of young people from the trade union Verdi
As for the Science Minister of Hesse Land Eva Kühne Hörmann CDU she has sided with the action taken by the President of the University and the police
We thank the president of the university
Any sit in and defacement of the premises is totally unacceptable she said at the Regional Parliament of Wiesbaden last Thursday during the television programme Aktuelle Stunde
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism said the CDU member of the Peter Beuth regional parliament
The parliament groups from the opposition SPD the Greens and the Left Party die Linke did not share this point of view
The CSU is making an excuse of a few daubed walls to criminalise the protests Janine Wissler from the La Gauche Linke party said
Instead of considering the arguments and the claims of the students one shrugs them off
The party La Gauche has filed a motion which summons the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of the intervention of the police
The new Silicon valley
For a long time she had the reputation of a secret city forbidden to the Western visitors
Zelenograd one of the ten districts of Moscow was under the Soviet regime a place of research for secret arming under strict monitoring
Today with its 216 000 people 37 km from the centre of Moscow the town has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley
Major production and research sites in micro and nano electronics have set up there
Since September 2008 representatives of Zelenograd have created ties with Riedberg Frankfurt s science area with academic institutions and companies at the center of innovations in Frankfurt FIZ
There were mutual meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a memorandum of close cooperation
The signatories were the Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the Prefect of Zelenograd Anatoly Smimov for the Russian delegation and Edwin Schwarz Project Section Head for Frankfurt
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and SMEs which the skill is scientific research will leave to Zelenograd for a seminar
Scientific exchange
It is a lasting scientific exchange
But also of economic relations
It will enable companies of the FIZ to enter the fully expanding Russian market
Conversely the Russian scientific companies want to secure contracts in Germany
Zelenograd is the headquarters of institutions and famous Soviet research companies
There is the Institute of electrical engineering of Moscow the big firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika
The town was founded in 1958 as a planned socialist city for weapon research
Zelenograd literal translation of green city takes its name of the forested hills at the heart of which the research centres are located
The S21 project an obstacle to Stuttgart
We cannot put high enough the extent of the Stuttgart 21 project
For his supporters it is nothing less than new heart of Europe
If one wants S21 is far more than the burial of a railway station in the ground more than a massive construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden Württemberg into a dispiriting chaos of work sites for a decade
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s
The train stations with front of the line tracks that ended in the heart of cities had a reputation at the time of being relics of 19th century transportation techniques that had the effect of slowing modern rail traffic because too much time was required to get the engines from the back to the front
Arrival short stop departure that is what you have to do
This is why the front line stations must disappear in Frankfurt and Munich
And in Stuttgart too a railway station which is located half way between Paris and Budapest Bratislava on the Magistral trans european line and whose slogan is Heart of Europe
The project S21 will really start although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost of putting the railway stations under ground in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant
As a matter of fact stations at the head of each line do not really pose problems of entry and exit since the advent of modern trains reversible ones with auto rails and pilot cars at both ends
However the achievement of Stuttgart 21 alongside the new route of the inter city line towards Ulm is triggered now
The regional and municipal policies prevailed
The railway company is of the part because it is the taxpayer who paid the price of the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the public enterprise
From an urban point of view this project let itself relatively well justify
One obtains an urban area that according to the graphics of the planners generated by computer will be very green
For the railway transportation system the S21 is harmful
The passage station and the section enlargement are designed for a people traffic which was attribued and this is typical of the 1980s a huge growth
At the time the competition of cheap flights did not exist yet
Modern traffic policy should first concentrate on improving merchandise shipping since railway transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck over the highway
But the new route with its inclines is not suited to freight trains
The S21 and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects
For example six billion euros will be swallowed up in the project of the Souabe
It is the official number
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion is more realistic
One thing is sure in the next decade this money will be missed for other junction and congestion points in the network
The list of the Ministry of Transport mentions 60 large projects in all
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section across the Rhine Valley of a good 180 kilometres
Since 1987 this line is built in slow motion
It would really be urgent here to accelerate hard
But the S21 project has the effect of a braking sabot
The Rhine Valley route is becoming the bottleneck of international freight traffic and it is happening in the very heart of Europe
The government is reviewing the judgement concerning the airport
At the Regional Parliament of Wiesbaden the Land s government has raised the possibility to appeal the judgment of the Administrative Court in Hesse regarding the ban on air flights at night
The Economy Minister Dieter Posch FDP has announced that the coalition CDU FDP had entrusted experts to examine the legal status of the ruling by the administrative court which is a document containing more than 400 pages
The Court of Kassel had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation regarding the ban on night flights in case the construction project of the north west runway of the airport of Frankfurt would be realized
The permission to land for 17 planes between 11 p m and 5 00 a m as envisaged by the government of the Land is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against nocturnal air nuisances
The coalition must have decided by January 4th if it wants to make a further appeal against the ruling
The opposition criticises this delay and tries to put pressure on the government representative so that he gives up the appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig
The head of the parlimentary group SPD Torsten Schäfer Gümbel asked the CDU and FDP to back up their promises made before the elections to ban night flights Otherwise it would be consdidered as going back on their word
It is very difficult to be allowed to keep its word said the Greens leader Tariq al Wazir alluding to the FDP s electoral catchphrase We keep our promises
The minister Dieter Posch refute accusations from Schäfer Gümbel which claims that the national government is trying to allow night flights using weaseling lawyers
It takes time to perform a precise legal review
The coalition does not wish to make any decisions on the basis of a quick first impression
The decision must be legally accountable said Stefan Müller FDP
The opposition s interpretation of the statements of his faction about the ban on night flights is completely erroneous
US banks pay back the allocated aid
The big American banks very affected by the crisis are breaking their link with the state
Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury 45 billion more than 30 billion euros corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan
The American television channel CNBC said in a report that Citigroup considered also to repay the received aid
Banking institutions are trying to get rid of legal restrictions tied to the acceptance of certain amounts such as limitations on the bonuses awarded to CEO s as well as the payment of higher fees
The Bank of America launched a capital increase by the sale of securities from investors who reported 19 billion dollars of new money
The rest of the money comes from the bank s savings that have been filled by the sale of several branches from other sectors
Last Wednesdday evening Kenneth Lewis the CEO of Bank of America made a point to thank the American taxpayers the injection of capital has considerably helped to overcome a difficult period
The banking institution had overestimated its resources in buying the Merrill Lynch investment bank at the height of the financial turmoil
Citigroup is also considering getting money on financial markets in order to free itself from the guardianship of the State
The American bank could thus launch on Thursday a 20 billion capital increase reported the CNBC channel quoting banking circles
Citigroup spokesman did not wish to comment this information
In June the Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley banks had repaid the money they received
Accelerated election
Ultimately everything has past faster than expected
Barely two weeks after the sacking of the current holder of the post of chief editor Nikolaus Brender by the board of directors of the German channel ZDF the successor is already appointed
The Commission wanted to vote last night to confirm the nomination
Peter Frey who runs the Berlin newsroom of ZDF was the odds on favourite
The process has not wanted to confirm officially the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure
However it seems that there was also the wish not to further harm ZDF intendant Markus Schächter in case the proposal would not be accepted by the Board
Frey who is the candidate of Schächter needed the votes of nine members of the Commission out of 14
The result of the vote was not yet known at the conclusion of the redation of this edition
Two weeks ago Schächter had proposed to the board to extend Nikolaus Brender s contract five years but it was rejected
Only 7 of the council members had declared themselves to be in favor of Brender s renewal while 7 others had voted against Bender s impeachment by the vote represented a bitter though predictable failure for Schächter
Indeed the CDU which has a majority on the board had already suggested several weeks before the vote their unwillingness to renew Brender to his post
It is Roland Koch the Minister President of the Hesse Land who had organised a league against the chief editor
He had rejected extending the contract of the esteemed editor in chief citing the fact that the ratings of the ZDF newscasts had fallen under Brender
This is why protests were still taking place almost until the vote lashing out at the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF
At the end there was even 35 experts in public law who had interfered in the debate and felt that the way to act Koch was unconstitutional
But it will have achieved nothing
Peter Frey who is he
Peter Frey was born on August 4th 1957 in Bingen
He has studied politics pedagogy and Romance languages Spanish
He then worked at the Südwestfunk radio body of Rhineland Palatinate and at the Frankfurter Rundschau German daily newspaper of national significance
In 1983 he becomes an editor at ZDF first for the news magazine heute journal a newspaper today
Then his journey continues from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy executive editor at the time then Washington correspondant in 1991 and 1992 and until 1998 he was the editor and presenter of Morgenmagazins a bimonthly news program airing during the morning until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin editorial board
After the disgrace of Brender whereas he had just been elected journalist of the year by the specialized revue Medium Magazin the Greens have announced they will put down a constitutional complaint
The enemy of Koch on board the minister Rhineland president Palatinate Kurt Beck said last week that the states should change the intergovernmental ZDF treaty so that the intendant proposals of employeers may not be blocked by a political majority biased
Nevertheless Beck has no plans to ask for the withdrawal of the politicians who are members of committees overseeing the ZDF
Peter Frey the likely successor to Brender had ably maneuvered before the board by vehemently criticising the Commission s decision to dismiss Brender
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence Schächter was able to propose him for the position of Editor in Chief without losing face the same way the Administration Council could elect him without anyone suspecting it was partisan politics to place him in the post
In the arithmetic representations of parties Frey is classified as a left wing liberal
Large cleanup in the academic studies
Partial success for students After a year of instructive strike ministers of education and cultural affairs of Länder decide to be more accommodating during a meeting between ministers and representatives from the conference of vice chancellors an agreement has been set up stipulating that working conditions of bachelor or masters degree students should be improved
In future students should be able to complete their studies
They particularly agreed to reduce the weight of exams a unique exam should end the chosen study module
Furthermore the burden of work will have to be reconsidered to ensure a realistic and acceptable proportion
The political authorities and and institutions of higher education wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad
The states have also pledged to set up more flexible joint structural requirements for the Bachelors and Masters tracks
Regionally there should be no different regulation from a Land to another
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June the Minister of Education of the federal states and the rectors of the universities have been constantly repeating the currently fashionable term studiability
But for the first time this expression seems to take a practical meaning
The Accreditation Council has decided to slash the number of some tests Each module should normally be completed by a single examination we read in a thirty page document on the future conditions of entry to university degree programs
Reinhold Grimm President of the Accreditation Council says that by greatly reducing the burden of the tests one should be able to stop the disruptions which have been considerably damaging to the ability to learn
Studyability should moreover be in future the benchmark of the organization of studies
The modules as the substance must be examined carefully to see if we cannot prevent this stifling feeling felt sometimes in the course choice
Hamburg Berlin According to the latest RAID information about Kunduz the opposition believes that Defence minister Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg CSU is guilty of deliberate deception
Students should have the opportunity and the necessary leeway to allow and encourage personal initiative
The new regulation will affect the new University courses but will also be suited to the existing courses
These cycles must be reaccredited every 5 years which means however that it is only by 2015 that all the cycles will have been examined
There are 10 accrediting agencies responsible for the entire federal territory that depend on accreditation councils created by the Länder
In October Education Ministers had pressure the Landër so that they influence the agencies in order to make the programs not too heavy and the review system not too strict
In some states specialized universities and colleges have already come to an agreement with their regional ministers to take appropriate action
So far Rhineland Palatinate is the only state which agreed to give more money to the development of Bologna process
With these funds universities should organize tutorial programs and strengthen the offices of teaching orientation as well as the exam offices and those of international relations service
The Länder and the universities forecast for this a budget of 10 million euros
In early 2010 the government wants to introduce an amendment to the law on institutions of higher education to the Parliament
Following this there will only be one exam to take to finish the studies
The curriculum will have to be more flexible and besides we must be able to guarantee that we will accept the marks given by other institutions of higher education and access to the Masters degree must be simplified
By the end of next year the studiability of all academic cycles will be examined
Last Thursday the government and opposition once again have debated the question of study conditions in the country
The decisions were appreciated but criticisms have been heard
The federal President of the socialist students union has indicated that he wished that the organisation for educational policy does not happen again in the future behind the closed doors of Ministers and vice chancellors of universities
After the education strike at the latest the students as well as concerned persons should be able to express themselves a little
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the president of delegates to the conference of rectors HRK Margret Wintermantel The experience of the students is very useful to us she said Thursday during a meeting with the education ministers of the states with which the HRK is working on a common reform project
For the Union of Education and Science gew the decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough It demands the right and opportunity for each Bachelor graduate to enroll in a Master Cycle
Andreas Keller member of the steering committee of the GEW further requests that the federal states assure today s Bachelors students that tomorrow there will be enough places for Masters students and that learning conditions will be as good as possible
The Länder must therefore hire more lecturers
However the education ministers have not mentioned the possibility of easing access to the Master
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is with the words arrived in Germany and it is beautiful almost no more inspection points that begins a work of the poet Werner Söllner in which he describes in snippets of troubling sentences the experience of a dissident arrived in Germany who won the freedom but lost at the same time his linguistic territory
Werner Söllner born in 1951 in Banat in Romania was first a professor of German and English in Bucharest and subsequently Collection Manager in a publishing house for young people before settling in Frankfurt am Main
Söllner received various literary prizes in 1993 he held the much coveted Chair of Poetry at Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been the Director of the literature forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm Artist House in Frankfurt
He caused people to talk a lot about him in non literary circles last Tuesday at a conference in Munich whose theme was German Literature in the Mirror in Romania and the Distorting Mirror of Your Securitat Files
Visibly disturbed and embarrassed Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow German Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner William Totok Franz Hodjak and Helmut Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informer for the Securitate political police
In 1989 Söllner received the German language prize together with some of the other participants
The enlistment tests had begun insidiously in 1971
I am concludes Söllner someone who has not sufficiently known how to withstand the trials of intimidation of the Securitate
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter IM Walter
Almost simultaneously with the awarding of the Nobel prize to Herta Müller for his exemplary literary battles with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship the literary scene is shaken especially the community of German writers of Romanian origin by a case which clearly shows the abyss and the heinous acts of a political system based on police surveillance and intelligence
Werner Söllner is as far as one can say based on current knowledge not just guilty but also a victim
In his own Securitat dossier Walter played a role literature expert Michael Markel said after Söllner s confession and he referred to the positive influence of Walter who had interceded on his behalf
he may had been able to get him out of difficult situations at that time according to Markel
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment
The form in which Söllner made his statement before the public was unexpected however the admission by a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian Intelligence Service SRI is not in fact so surprising
Germany is a pleasant haven for Securitat spies Herta Müller had already written in July in the newspaper Die Zeit after having read the 914 pages of her own dossier
We may suppose that the victims will have made speculation and will sometimes have guessed what real names were hiding behind the borrowed names Sorin voicu and also Walter
In contrast to Germany where consultation of the Stasi dossiers is a reliable process for the moment the attitude toward the legacy of the Securitat s files is still very confused
A systematic clarification has been repeatedly frustrated and slowed down in the past
It is that only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate CNSAS but the return of files has rather dragged on since
There is since 2005 a law that defines the management of archives
That the influence of former members of the Securitat in Romania is still considerable is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the Securitat of Temesvar who after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller spoke in a very disdainful way about the winner
She had a psychosis and ultimately they only questioned her once
The infamy of power felt it could express itself here without any hindrance under the guise of freedom of expression
Certainly many unavoidable questions are involved in the Söllner case as so often happens in the context of a cover up
Why now Who was robbed The measured reaction of listeners to Söllner s confession gives us hope that the next chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller which received the Nobel prize yesterday it is more than a note at the bottom of page
Uproars in the Champions League
We had the impression that a representative was coming dressed to the nines coming straight from a nice Christmas celebration where a sporting goods manufacturer had displayed his merchandise when the new VfB coach Christian Gross showed up at 11 45 in a Mercedes C Class he had just called for with an orange plastic shopping bag from the manufacturer in his hand
The man whose bald skull drew the attention allowed himself to be led in the city which was still foreign to him
Otherwise our quinquagenarian would have been able to take the wheel himself he had not drunk any alcohol and he was not drunk with happiness either
He had spent a pleasant evening but tomorrow he had to go back to work
Because it is now that it would start
The words of the Swiiss that we just hired three days earlier were clear We have indeed reached the round before the quarterfinals that is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3 to 1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success It will be a rough struggle not to drop again
The tough work awaits us on Sunday
There it comes to daily repeated in Mainz the results of the Champions League
And the weaknesses which have been dug out after the three punishing goals from Marica 5 Träsch 8 and Pogrebnyak 11 have to be overcome
Draw of a lottery
The Champions League round of sixteen match go 16 17 23 24 February return match 9 10 16 17 March will be drawn on the December18 in Nyon
The sudden office taking s joy of Babbel s successor was finally moderate
And the joy was not moderated only for those who had brought them luck who had transmitted to the destabilized Stuttgart professionals an unfailing desire and joy to play
I went to see the players and I told them that they should concentrate on their strengths I advised them to be more courageous the souls plumber Gross explained the recipe for success that was sounding so well but which was no longer efficient with the therapist Babbel
It has triggered a certain magic confessed Jens Lehmann supporter of Babbel in soccer when there is a new impetus things happen sometimes that one would never have thought possible
And Sami Khedira who after weeks of pause for injury rank best player in the world thanks to its dynamism tried to describe the phenomenon seen by a proverbial fresh wind and the working method of the new leader It is someone to go into action and requires discipline
This is what we need in the current situation
But apparently Babbel had lacked some
VfB Stuttgart has not yet turned the corner warned manager Horst Heldt
For the time being VfB Stuttgart is mostly in need of tenacity
Just as Gross the players and the manager refrain about overstating the victory against the completely exceeded and weakened defense of the Romanian guests
They had also won in Glasgow before having had four days later a rude awakening in Leverkusen with the 0 4 objected Khedira
Horst Heldt the manager said that they had actually reached one of the objectives of the season but there were others which were still very far off
We have not yet passed the difficult hurdle
If Heldt is not moody to celebrate the day of his 40th birthday even after the first victory at home for three months is due to the weekend s events as a television interview of the goalkeeper Jens Lehmann triggered just before the match begins
There are decisions that others make and not Jens countered Heldt in response to Lehmann s acerbic criticism
He had accused the direction of weakness in style and said that it had decided to change the coach under pressure from pubescent fans
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of loss of authority and of jealousy the fact that his day off after the game had been taken away from him
The statements of Lehmann were marked by a pure selfishness thrust Heldt and announced the consequences for the goalkeeper
They were more likely to become friends for life these two quadragenarians
In any case they were in agreement about everything else which is to say that without the previous work on the group by the replaced coach the strong and aggressive sports representation would not have been possible
Babbel and his assistants played a large part in the success retorted Heldt and Lehmann in unison and even the man with the plastic bag agreed
World heavyweight championship
Heavy fighting in Bern Kevin Johnson the challenger repeatedly provoked Vitali Klitschko the world champion both verbally and with gestures
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title of heavy weight champion of the world according to the version of the WBC Federation
Judges were unanimous he won by points
Hamburg Vitali Klitschko retains his title of world heavyweight champion
The WBC Federation announced that the 38 year old champion had won a unanimous victory on points Saturday night against the American Kevin Johnson 120 10
For the third time Klitschko honorably defends his title since his comeback on the stage in October 2008
Beforehand the Ukrainian had already won the title of world champion of the WBO and WBC federations twice
Unfortunately he didn t pass the KO as expected
Klitschko coming out 39 times a winner in 41 professional fights has had to concede his defeat twice because of injuries
The Johnson challenger has had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight
In the Berne Arena before 17 000 spectators the great Klitschko wanted above all to control the fight from his height of 6 ft 7 in using his left hook
Johnson about four inches shorter who proclaimed before the duel the end of the Klitschko era managed to avoid the champion s blows preventing Klitschko from bringing into play his dangerous right counterpunch
Johnson too passive in action for a challenger has above all tried to make the rounds
Although he kept provoking Klitschko by words and gestures his strokes reached only very rarely the champion
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000 to have exceeded with Klitschko the distance of 12 rounds
The challenger had done a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight
He insulted Klitschko calling him a dirty zombie who is not really capable
During the weighing on Friday the champion could not help provoking Johnson by making him drop his sunglasses from his nose to be able to see his eyes
Fourth victory since Klitschko s comeback
Klitschko imposed again during his fourth fight since his comeback on the 11th of October 2008
After a break of almost four years he had beaten at the time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered his WBC belt that he had to leave before without a fight
This year defending his title of champion he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola from the USA
I only took one hit in this fight and am in perfect shape said Klitschko to explain his quick return on the ring
His dream is to try to gather in the family the four most important titles
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations
But it is Britain s David Hague who having dethroned the big Nikolai Walujew 2 13 metres in November is wearing the belt of the WBA
This summer Haye had cancelled a game against Vitali Klitschko which should have taken place in September
It would seem that its marketing company now intends to have this match played at Wembley Stadium in London
The Kunduz case
A frontal attack by the opposition the head of the parliament coalition Green Group Jürgen Trittin accused Defense Minister Guttenberg of lying about the Kunduz case
The SPD and La Gauche die Linke parties ask the Chancellor for explanations
Hamburg Berlin After reviewing the latest intel on Kunduz air attack the opposition accused the minister of defence Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg CSU to have hidden willingly some facts
The Minister has intentionally formulated an untruth on the deadly attack on two tankers last September said the leader of the green parliamentary group Jürgen Trittin on Saturday during the information programme of the ARD channel Tagesschau News at 8pm
In clear this means that he lied
The order of killing has been given to total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan Isaf
It is in essence the content of the report available to NATO and that has been read by Mr Guttenberg Trittin said
Last Friday according to new revelations from the media the goal of the strike was in reality not to destroy the stolen trucks but to eliminate two major Taliban leaders
According to the inquiry report of NATO 142 people were killed or injured during the American aerial attack which was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein military commander from Kunduz
On Saturday the Greens the SPD and the Left called on Chancellor Angela Merkel CDU to speak to the Parliament as soon as possible and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast believe that Mrs Angela Merkel must clearly state whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government s Afghan policy and whether the chancellery army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy
The government spokesperson categorically rejects these criticisms
The chancellery has in no way influenced the interventions of the military in Afghanistan he said
On Saturday voices were getting louder to express doubts regarding the real reasons concerning the referral of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert as it was presented by the ministry
According to the pieces of information from the Spiegel newspaper the information they had handed over to Guttenberg concerning the attack of the tankers were both accurate and complete
Officially they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hid some troublesome details from the Minister
From staff members of the two senior officials one hears however that they have informed the Ministry of Defense of the existence of several reports including a two page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police
The Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reported that Wichert would have meanwhile called for a facts clarification in a letter
Until now he has received no reply
On Saturday the ministry did not want to comment these accusations and refers to the inquiry commission of the federal parliament which would be formed next Wednesday to bring the facs in question to light
The worlds of dream
Some see while awake images and voices that nobody else sees or hears
It is not only among patients with psychological illnesses or under the effect of drugs that the boundaries between fantasy and reality become blurred
While these phenomena occur during sleep everything is going very well
When we are lying in our darkened bedrooms we can give ourselves over to dreams and to the wildest fantasies without any barriers
However the one who experiences the state of dream when awaken hears and sees things that others do not has quickly the reputation of being mad or drugged in our Western world or at least of being an eccentric
Such images and voices only appear among those who are mentally ill or under the effects of drugs
It is our imagination that is involved it is the same neuronal activity which allows us to design houses paint pictures or write novels but which sometimes causes the boundaries between dreaming madness and reality to merge
A state of conscious awakening taking the shape of a dream can present itself in the most diverse forms called in the best of cases visions in the worst madness
But even if the cause and the effect can be distinguished from one another the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda the trance states of shamans psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance of neurotransmitter substances in the brain first and foremost dopamine norepinephrine serotonin and achétylcholine breaks and that the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted
Complex hallucinations and delirious thoughts are very often present during schizophrenic psychosis
The earth s gravity strength has no more power over the person
Since Antiquity philosophers and doctors have always looked into the relationship between madness and dream
For Aristotle hallucinations were a form of daydreaming Wilhelm Griesinger one of the founders of modern psychiatry noted in 1861 a great similarity between madness and dreaming for Sigmund Freud the dream state was a psychosis with all of the irregularities imaginings delusions and sensory illusions that go into one
We are in the autumn of 2001 when Henning T turned into a figure of a comic strip
His body is two dimensional with screaming colours
Gravity has no more power over him he is hovering close to the ceiling
He feels a blow
Behind him winged evil creatures grimacing with a bloody mouth showing their teeth
They are chasing him kicking him with heavy blazing boots drop him against the walls he feels pains in his all body
Thundering evil howling voices coming from the walls and the radio
He can no longer stand these voices that insult and humiliate him
Henning T rips two cables from his stereo system makes a loop from them and attaches it to a hook set in the ceiling
He climbs on an audio subwoofer and puts the loop around his neck
He jumps
The loop is coming off
May this teach you a lesson the voices scream in a chorus to tear the eardrum go to a clinic and go cure yourself
Today Henning T is 40 years old he has experienced six acute psychosis the last one goes back to 2 years ago the first one nearly 20 years ago
It was triggered by LSD
The diagnosis paranoid schizo affective psychosis in addition he is manic depressive he takes medication for depression mania and schizophrenia
He has learnt to live with his illness he has been married for three years
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fears terrible and deep despairs
Illusions are a harsh reality
Around one percent of the population suffer from schizophrenia at least once in their life in psychiatric clinics it is the most common illness after depression
In a schizophrenia crisis people can no longer make the difference between the inside world and the outside world they are in a state of strong excitement which makes that they may suffer from hallucinations megalomania relationship madness or persecution
It is very common to hear voices voices which order which comments or talk
Optical hallucinations are not rare either
The affected person can no longer distinguish between what is important and what is insignificant the brain can no longer filter the disruptive signals the conscious is flooded with sensations
Just like the dream the psychosis opens the floodgates to a tide of ideas and fantasies that emerged from the deepest layers of consciousness
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject according to Professor Thomas Fuchs head of department of psychiatry of the University Hospital Center in Heidelberg Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum
The schizophrenic is in the centre of the situation everything has a meaning that is focused on him
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role he feels like dreaming overcome by the events and he cannot act on them actively
This is the reason why schizophrenics often feel threatened watched manipulated
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust reality illusions are a harsh reality to wake up is excluded
To experience a hallucination once in his life
Unlike the dream according to Fuchs the sensory and space structure of the reality that is perceived during the psychosis is fundamentally preserved
Thoughts and delirious hallucinations are based on reality lived alienation happens in a real framework
Why our brain does this kind of antic is still a puzzle for researchers
Exceptional situations can cause one to momentarily lose his or her sense of reality according to Fuchs
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors
Researchers suspect that the people involved presents tiny brain damage
We assume that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy Fuchs explains
But what is still unexplained is how the anomaly of the neuronal system happens and also the fact that it does not happen for many years
The environmental factors also play a role stress or a traumatic experience can be a psychosis trigger however if there is a predisposition
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters
When our brain heats up
What is crazy says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck is that the psychotics suffer from hallucinations and take their costly medicines to unravel them when others are buying very expensive drugs to obtain them
The perception of pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a point of view
For ten years Kasten has collected reports about hallucinations and the phenomena relating to visual delusions last year he published his findings in a work entitled The Imaginary World In Our Heads
Hallucinations are part of the typical concomitant phenomena of psychoses but also of an impressive number of many other pathologies
One counts among them psychological troubles such as borderline personality disorder or depression but also migraines epilepsy multiple sclerosis Alzheimer s or traumatic brain injuries
It is surprising to find that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy people are subject to hallucinations
The hallucinations according to Kasten consists of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited
They take shape when the areas of the brain which deal with sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently curbed when our brains heat up but also when there is lack of stimulation
Drugs can trigger this state as well as a brain injury or a psychosis
But the lack of stimulus too stress unhappy love affairs or other exceptional mental states
In recent studies one third of participants acknowledges having had at least once in his life the experience of a hallucination
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K is 16 she lives in the little town of Mecklembourg formerly Pomerania and she goes to school
A girl pretty normal to tell the truth
If the images and voices weren t there
During recess a thin young boy with chestnut hair speaks to him
When she answers him her comrades look at her surprised nobody else sees or hears this boy
They believe that this timid girl is a dreamy lunatic but Sarah K is not dreaming she is certain about that
She is awaker hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl who is sitting next to her on the bench
She can even sense his presence temporarily
It is a pleasant feeling she finds this youth sympathetic
Am I crazy she sometimes asks herself
But she knows very well that this youth and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again
By night spooks are generaly frightening
Often the visions are cumbersome
When she is in class sometimes she cannot follow the course because to her eyes and ears the professor seems to be introducing a new pupil who is invisible to the others even though the professor is obviously in the midst of explaining some equations at the blackboard
By night the outbreaks are generally frightening
When in the darkness of her room she awaits sleep which happens too rarely and far too late she often cannot distinguish if she is awake or already dreaming if the images she sees grinning faces or the girl with bloody cuts on her arms and her legs are in front of her open or closed eyes
Leave me alone she cries at the creatures
She doesn t talk about it to his parents or friends she would be taken for crazy
Autumn 2009 Sarah K is now 20 years old
She had her baccalaureate last year and she lives with her friend
One year ago the hallucinations have ceased
Since she contacted via Internet the psychologist Kasten she knows well that she is not insane
Madness is also a work of art of despair
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough incentives the probability is high that he will have hallucinations after some time
I suppose that the brain not being occupied enough makes sure that there is activity in there
Sarah K only daughter was afraid of other children when she was small and often played all alone
Her hallucinations began when she learned at age 13 that the man she had called Daddy since she was in age of thinking was not her real father
The same areas of the brain are active in visual and acoustic hallucinations and with real impressions and sounds so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to tell the difference between illusion and reality Each experience according to Kasten takes place in the brain reality is formed there
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain which is why they seem so real
For Kasten nighttime dreams are also a form of hallucination
The hallucinations of healthy people are no different fundamentally from those in acute psychoses
Unlike schizophrenics the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images
This is why Kasten advises her patients to cherish the hallucinations as a particular talent
There is a only one step between dream and hallucination
In our world too focused on the conscience we unfortunately quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for ailments according to Michael Schmidt Degenhard professor at Heidelberg clinic and chief doctor of psychiatry and psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale hospital in Düsseldorf
A psychosis is a very serious illness painful but also with something positive and creative in it madness is a work of art of despair
Schmidt Degenhard has studied the form of experience called oniroïd a specific form of the modification of consciousness brought about by dreaming
Oniroïd experiences are very complex dream like states which are perceived as real by the person who experiences them and which he cannot differentiate from dreaming even when he is awake
The oniroïd state of consciousness occurs during a trauma or in situations of extreme pathology as in patients with polyradiculopathy who while fully conscious experience paralysis
According to Schmidt Degenhard when a human being is threatened with the loss of his self and his world due to a total and permanent inability to move he replaces this real situation which disrupts his life with his own fantasy world disassociated from reality
It is a state of mental limit between dream and hallucination
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality a change in the world has taken place but the real situation is represented in the imagination
This is in fact an intense form of means and performing in a situation intolerable in itself an organizational capacity that is given to us men in order to not sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness
Everything is real even later in memories
Peter Classen Cornelius from Zurich and art historian also describes his oniroid experiences in his book Change of heart as an action to safeguard the soul
He was 49 when his awareness left for a several days journey after the operation of a corneas with a transplant meanwhile his body was doomed to stand still while being resuscitated
Claussen plunges into a world which he has created visits foreign places travels in time He sees himself as an old man bedridden in a railway sanatorium a robot at his bedside looking after his health
He lives during the Middle Ages among nobles who manufacture drugs based on blood
He is kidnapped by a Greek on a motorbike who takes him to his country he surfs with his hospital bed on a mass of hardened ice in the Alps and he meets a Korean mafioso
He is completely absorbed in this imaginary world everything is real even later in his memories
According to Claussen these interior voyages differ fundamentally from any dream
The dream is a completely different state he writes describing what he has lived
Instead of dreams the memories from the mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later
You could even say that they are much more distinct and intensive than true live experience
The intensity of this experience shatters the horizon of our other everyday experiences according to the psychiatrist Schmidt Degenhard
Ultimately oniroïdes delusions psychoses hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our interior representations of exterior reality are even in a waking state
Any change in the state of consciousness sums up psychologist Kasten can cause a distortion of what we call reality
An experiment that can also be quite enriching
The first snows can fall
Burda
At 27 years old the children will take over the publishing house
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of Burda editions is an interim solution in the long term Hubert Burda hopes that his two children will take the press group over he told Spiegel magazine
The holding company must remain 100 a family business
Hamburg In the long term publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at 27 years old and are firmly committed to integrate the company Hubert Burda 69 said to Spiegel
All details have been settled in advance
The question about whether or not they will be active in the company will be asked later on
One will also have to see if they are able
We cannot impose their children to 7 500 employees without knowing whether they have the ability to look at it
This will demoralize children as well as the company
Burda let it be known last Thursday that he is pulling out of his post as President Director General beginning in January and that his successor would be Paul Bernhard Kallen
Kallen 52 years of age has been a member of the board since 1999
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector
Later he held the Treasury department that is to say he was responsible of the company capital and after Jürgen Todenhöfer s departure he also took the head of the marketing the foreign department the printing and the finance
Thus for the first time it is not a family member who is head of Burda Editions
Burda s children are respectively 19 and 17 years old his son Felix who would now be 42 died a few years ago
The nomination of Kallen also serves to make the connection for the next 10 or 15 years
Burda specifies that the holding company must remain 100 in the hands of the family
Ruination has always taken place in the families who have let themselves being led by a bulimia for capital who have made enormous unfortunate speculations by thinking that they could always climb higher
This has never been my strategy
I have never had one universal power dream said Burda
I absolutely do not see myself in the role of preceptor of the country as Springer could be and I do not intend to be part of the international leagues like the Time these companies have become much too important

Endesa and Barcelona are equipped with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa in collaboration with the Ayuntamiento of Barcelona has created the Oficina Live
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital
The LIVE Office Logistics for the Integration of the Electric Vehicle will define and coordinate the road map for the integration of electric cars in the city and will put agreements with regard to mobility in place while taking steps coordinating presenting grants etc
Moreover it will develop the MOVELE project promote the electric car and welcome the opinions and the work of the sectors involved
Ultimately the idea is to launch what will become the future of transportation
3 electrical cities
But Barcelona is not the only city that will get involved in the implantation of electric car in Spain
Madrid and Seville come to join the project
It is the three cities chosen by the government within the framework of the Movele Plan in order to launch the implementation of electric cars
The electric company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat in Catalonia
It aims to promote Research and Development technology in the autonomous community of Catalonia
Among these latter can be found the activities related to energy especially to energy efficiency
This is not the only initiative to which Endesa takes part in terms of promoting the electric car
The company takes part in standardisation groups at the European level and is currently involved in a range of supplementary projects such as G4V ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE
Zapatero predicts a peaceful future for the engine sector
The president José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero foresees a future of peace for the Spanish automotive industry which he reminded is the country s main area of export
In the president s presentation of the economic report for 2009 Zapatero recalled the measures initiated by the executive over the course of the year in support of the automotive sector
Without the Plan of Competitiveness for the automotive sector we would have today a desolate landscape closures of some of our main production sites the President of the government said
With this plan and the brands decision to remain in Spain in a very competitive field we can see peaceful vistas for the future of this industry which is our main export business he added
In that sense he pointed out that the Competitiveness Plan included in the Full Plan for the Automotive Sector PIA has devoted 800 million euros to the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 ancillary businesses which mobilized an investment of more than 3 000 million euros
The chief executive explained that this investment was intended as much for the development of new models as for the modernization of already existing products and processes
Zapatero also emphasized government measures to support the demand referring to Plan 2000E established in collaboration with the autonomous communities and the car companies
According to the President this plan has helped reduce by 6 the average emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and has contributed to a sharp increase of registrations which have improved by 40 in November

Mazda3 i stop a long lasting sporting spirit
Madza intends to prove that sport spirit is not angry with environment respect
To this effect it has just added to the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system called i Stop a device which at least for the moment is available only on the 150 horsepower 2 0 gasoline engine
This second generation of Mazda3 is known for the good marks it has received overall
The details the finishing of the vehicle the habitability the behaviour the mechanics the i Stop system
All these aspects are noticeable in the new Mazda3
Starting with the driving position it appears that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixation
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant
Continuing with the whole formed by the dashboard and the console we see how Mazda has followed the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design with many buttons and control panels along with vivid red and blue colors
This style reminds us partially of the Honda Civic
It is why we can say that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic both Japanese contrast with the seriousness of German products particularly the Volkswagen Golf which everyone wants to overtake
Continuing with the cockpit this Japanese compact car offers a habitability more than sufficient to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort
In addition to all this a large trunk with regular shapes
The automatic stop and start engine system at least for the moment is only available with the two liter 150 horsepower gasoline engine with manual six speed shift
This engine is a true joy It is shown in its finesse its low noise its benefits and consumption control
Indeed although the most requested Mazda3 are the diesel models those who do not do a large number of kilometers per year should not rule out this i Stop with gasoline engine both for its great speed comfort and for its controlled consumption
Regarding the level of equipment the model chosen for the test is the Sport meaning the one which offers the highest number of series elements
Among the standard equipments the Blind Spot Information System BLIS which erase blind spots the traction and stability controls the speed regulator photosensitive inside mirror on board computer on a large screen parking sensors independent air conditioning rain and light sensors Bluetooth and Bluetooth audio and the 17 inches alignment wheels are particularly remarkable
Moreover as if this equipment weren t enough this version had the Premium Pack which for 1 500 more includes among other features bi xenon adaptive headlights and an audio system with a Bose disc changer
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2 0 i stop is one of the best compact cars in its class
It is especially demonstrated by the quality of materials used by his behaviour and by his high level of equipment
Moreover those who do not travel many miles per year will be able to choose the i Stop version only associated with the gasoline 2 0 engine of 150 hp
The only drawback of this model is its high price which cost between 21 770 Euro for the Luxury finishing and 23 270 Euro for the tested model the Sportive
In return for this large sum of money the Mazda3 will give us a large dose of satisfaction every day

FonPeek s promise
Peek is extremely limited it is a device which only allows you to look at your e mail without offering the possibility of seeing certain types of attachments or surfing the Internet
It took advantage of its five minutes of fame in the United States when TIME magazine named it one of the products of the year
In truth it is more difficult to see him in the streets but the idea seems interesting especially for young people
Unlike Smartphones Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription less than half of the cost for example of a subscription for an iPhone
Given its success the company has launched two new devices one designed exclusively for Twitter the other with a free lifetime data service six times more expensive than the Peek
Fonpeek presented yesterday at the Le Web event is the invention European version and its third incarnation
It is just as limited as its American big brother but contains a surprise
The price of its monthly subscription about 12 euros includes the roaming across Europe
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is like to lose access to one s data when one crosses a border or to desperately seek a cafeteria with WiFi or a connection to FON to be able to check one s e mail
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and it makes a long time that it should work
Indeed some operators benefit from special traveling arrangements and options but as far as I am concerned I would need to have obtained a PhD in physics to understand them and to wear magnifying glasses to read the small printed lines
The repeated reminders of the European Commission to propose affordable roaming fees across Europe have been barely perceptible
Outside one s native country one hesitates to use the data and that s not wrong
That a small device like Fonpeek it is always funny that it is called FON even though it does not have WiFi offers this kind of fare means that operators are starting to think differently and are considering various suggestions that help making their data network profitable
Kindle is another good example it includes the download of books and other research on the Internet
Without a subscription and without any hassle
It is a connected device and one pays at its purchase and not every month
And this is what I hope to see some day for the FonPeek an option to buy with an access for life same as Peek has already offered it in the United States
It s not that I want to buy it
I read my mail on my phone thank you
I wish for it simply because I believe that it is a more fair formula for the consumer
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system
Michelle s favourite colour
Yellow is probably the favourite colour of the first lady of the United States
She went to the United States presidential inauguration of Barack Obama with a dress and a coat of this color and in effect she chose the same to accompany him in the second instance without doubt the most important of his life the awarding in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize
Michelle Obama was wearing a model very similar in those two occasions in addition to their resembling colour drawing a yellow to green with bright reflections both times consisted of three parts the penitent the jacket and the coat in the same tissues and was adorned of a large embroidery and a necklace
So at first glance it seems that the first lady of the United states is following the aftermath of the Princess of Asturias and chose to get the same clothes
But the fabrics from which the two outfits were cut make them very different
While she wore a heavy lace fabric for the inauguration in Oslo she wore a printed velvet
The accessories are also different green shoes with medium heels for the first event and a similar model but gold trimmed this time
The hairdressing has changed too The hair is now raised whereas she was having it undone last time
75 of working mothers have had professional problems because of their childbearing
Discrimination at work has risen in recent years especially for the young generation women who want to be mothers
This is what was shown by the Fertility and Careers of Women in Spain study carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer Woman s Institute
The inquiry carried out on 9 737 women from ages 15 to 75 leaves no room for doubt 75 of working mothers have seen their careers limited because of motherhood
The study indicates that there are many differences having to do with the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children whether the woman is working or not and the type of employment
Those who do not work outside the home work part time or have a less stable jobs get married sooner have their first pregnancy sooner and have more children
On the other hand women having a stable job mainly in the public sector reject entering a couple and the first pregnancy and have fewer children
Women between 35 and 49 years of age with a permanent job have their first child on average 3 7 years after becoming a couple This figure rises to 4 1 among those who work in the public sector These data show that women who had a stable job needed more time in their lives to get it which led them to delay the union and the arrival of children
In addition the type of employment greatly influenced motherhood but not as much the beginning of life as a couple explains Margarita Delgado the researcher at the CSIC
The level of education is another factor which widens the gap between the age of marriage of women and their first child
According to the investigation the more they are educated the more they marry and have their first child later
The difference remains even among women of the same generation
For example in the group being between 35 and 49 years old those who have had elementary and advanced education have become mothers for the first time respectively at 25 1 and 32 1 years old on average
Another distinction also appears among women according to their education level
While those who have done studies elementary marry and have their first child before finding a stable job those who have done studies of average level or above reverse this programme and give priority to obtain a stable job as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child says Mrs Delgado
Diane Kruger is worth it too

Delicious pleasure this book is also a moving invitation to readings and rereadings
I leave you here a few snapshots
On Albert Camus In its pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea but a spiritual impulse almost physical which I even felt without naming it pleasure against disastrous fate morals without guilt and innocence without any god
On Samuel Beckett Nihilistic allegorical Christian he wrote what he had in his blood not in his head between impotence and ignorance with a splendid poetic wit devoid of meaning like the blade of the knife that failed to kill him
On Graham Greene Our man has been inspired by this woman with a passion that lasted 13 years in the flesh of which he joined the emotion of adultery to the pleasure of remorse a spiritual privilege which was to reach heaven by the road to perdition
On James Joyce Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach It is one of the 8 000 meter summits of universal literature which it is necessary to climb by the North face on which the best mountain climbers let go and then catch themselves again
On William Faulkner He was a strange character
By himself he said sometimes he was the heir of a landowner of the county and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile
These two dreams were of greatness
About Louis Ferdinand Céline This writer take in the mad scream pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to lead his echo deep in the night of the 20th century in its literal form and he did it in self escape invoking the posteriority with an asticots violent speech
About Dorothy Parker One day she knelt and prayed Dear God I beg you to do that I stop writing like a woman
On Joseph Conrad On his tombstone was engraved Spenser s verse Sleep after effort after the storm the port rest after war worn out after life death is very pleasing
On Virginia Wolf in her luggage she was carrying her depression too
Her husband accepted very normally that she told him that Edward VII was spying on her between the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek
There has never been a man as patient and as deeply in love with a neurotic whose literary talent exceeded her madness
On Pío Baroja What did Martín Santos do if it is not trying to hide Joyce at Baroja s

A cowardly attack
Last week my mother who is about 70 was strolling through our neighborhood in the city of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 passed her and our dog a mixed blood rescued from the ASPCA and weighing no more than six kilos and without saying a word they kicked him twice which left the dog seriously injured
Our indignation is huge because we do not see what is fun in gratuitously attacking a small defenceless animal which moreover was on leash
One must also add the outrage of a lady who was quietly passing by and who when she injured these individuals came to fear for her physical well being since an oddball who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman a child an elderly person or ultimately any person weaker than him
The episode happened around 5 p m on a normal Tuesday in an usually quiet district
The dog moaned all day
Of course we filed a complaint at the neighborhood police station even though we doubt that much will come of it and though we don t want to offend any sensitivities we just want to say that the cowardly killers were Spanish
Outrage led us to denounce this deed
We do not understand what is happening in young people s mind for them to find amusing to mistreat defenceless animals without reason which gives us love friendship and companionship
We don t know where good education and respect of animals and people has gone
Michelin and Festival together for the wearing of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin in collaboration with the Spanish foundation for road safety fesvial has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmets mainly among younger motorcyclists as indicated it today both structures
This initiative aims at raising awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet since it is the only element of protection to prevent injuries to the head or even death in a two wheelers accident
Michelin has indicated that this campaign showed its commitment to road safety which goes beyond the design and manufacture of safer products and said that it contributed to this goal by other actions of an educational and informative nature
This new campaign of encouragement for the wearing of a helmet when on two wheels with the slogan to be or not to be will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages in order to ensure the widest diffusion
Finally Michelin has pointed out that road safety is a constant concern for the company because as a manufacturer of tyres for two wheeled vehicles one of its main goals is to develop always safer products
The sale of light commercial vehicles is improving
After nearly two years ago the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain account for an increase of 12 6 compared to 2008 and more important they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline according to figures from the employers association of the manufacturers Anfac and ganvam the dealers
However it should be set against the good news since the yardstick used for comparison the month of November 2008 has been particularly bad with a decrease of 60 compared to the previous year
As a result despite last month s rebound registrations accumulated during the past 11 months are 40 below those of the previous year
Since January if you add all vehicles in the category of light commercial vehicles derivatives of tourist cars pick ups minivans small vans and light trucks 95 853 have been sold
The big clouds that affect their demand the most have not dissipated Indeed although they are also bought by individuals most of the purchases are made by small or medium sized businesses which pay in almost 100 of the cases by means of outside financing
Thus besides the restrictions implied by limiting bank loans we have to add other factors such as the increase in unemployment or the persistence of the poor economic situation
Dealing with this situation and unlike passenger cars purchase aids of 2000E have been little used
In addition to individuals the self employed and the small businesses which want to acquire a commercial vehicle slightly under 3 5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer can also benefit but the number of operations speaks for itself
Yesterday at Ganvam they brought up again the need for management to pay particular attention to these vehicles and to industrial vehicles trucks and buses
The Dealers Association foresees a 2010 similar to the year that is ending for which it calculates a drop in sales of passenger cars and 4x4s of 19
Emergency brake assist is now mandatory
As has occurred with the ABS anti lock braking system and as will be the case with the ESP stability control systems to aid in emergency braking will be a compulsory element in European cars
They are already mandatory in newly registred cars and light commercial vehicles while a tolerance period for the rest of vehicles has been set until the end of February 2011
The measure imposed by the European Union aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians even if by its mode of action it can also help prevent many rear collisions
Emergency brake assist increase pressure on the breakes in emergency situation detected by the system thanks to the kick given by the driver
But this last one does not maintain the pressure until the end
According to a study conducted by Bosch the manufacturer of automobile components a third of drivers involved in an accident had not been able to rely on the brake before the collision and half of them had not benefited from its full force
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid however requires the maximum from the brake system reducing the distance the car needs to stop
According to an EU study if all cars were equipped with this feature as many as 1 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year
This reduction would be even more important by popularizing the so called intelligent emergency braking systems we estimate that one accident with road casualties out of four would be avoided
In this case the vehicle is equipped with a system which thanks to a radar or a camera detects obstacles and warns the driver in addition to slightly acting on the brakes
If the driver reacts he is helping it by increasing pressure on the pedal if it is necessary
If he does not react and although the collision is inevitable the facility exert the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage
General Motors postponed until January the plan for Opel
While workers from Opel s Figueruelas plant Zaragoza have been warned by Nick Reilly the new president of General Motors GM Europe that production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April probably the 8th according to Javier Ortega the North American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the Opel rescue plan
Nick Reilly the new President of GM Europe intends for each point of the plan to have been approved in advance by the concerned party
And this may mean that the final document which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located will be postponed until early 2010
In contrast at GM we are assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days
Another crucial step for the Balkans
Since the world has been focused on Iraq North Korea and a possible crisis with Iran over nuclear weapons Kosovo has gone somewhat unnoticed
The public will soon have the opportunity to turn its attention once again toward this province after the decision is made regarding its fate
The United States and their European friends have repeatedly stated their intention to take before the end of the year the difficult decision to separate or not Kosovo from Serbia
This decision crucial to the future of an unstable region will test Western resolve and unity
The talks this year in Vienna orchestrated by the United Nations have shown that an agreement between Serbia and Kosovo on a final status will not happen
Negotiations are continuing but as UN negotiator and former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari said very tactfully in the Security Council they are in actual fact dead
No Serbian leader will accept the independence of Kosovo because nationalism remains the dominant political force in the country
Indeed the Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica the apostle of Serbian nationalism has made every effort to undermine the interim government of Kosovo
He is eager to hold a national referendum this very month on a new constitution without serious parliamentary debate or the usual prior education of the public
The main objective of this new constitution consists in the preamble which maintains Kosovo in its status as an inalienable part of Serbia
The Kosovo Albanians have said they will accept no link with Serbia so tiny that it is
Throughout the 1990s they virtually left Serb managed Kosovo by creating parallel institutions
Their mass forced exodus in 1999 and the NATO intervention that followed putting an end to the Serbian reign and establishing a quasi state under the auspices of the UN has made any solution other than that of independence intolerable
A month or two from now the Contact Group in the Balkans the United States the United Kingdom France Germany Italy and Russia will consider the recommendations of Ahtisaari on the final status of Kosovo and will perhaps offer a solution to the Security Council which must make the final decision
In public all members of the contact group attempted to leave the question of Kosovo s final status open but in private the United States and some of its allies told the two parties they propose the independence this year
Some members of the Security Council notably Russia and China take a dim view of or remain sceptical about an imposed solution and few governments are in favor of dividing up the territory of another nation however compelling the circumstances may be
The choice by the Security Council to approve independence depends largely on the possibility of preventing a Russian veto which will require considerable diplomatic efforts
The nature of the independence granted also has its importance
Independent Kosovo should be able to live in safety and its minorities should be protected
The north of Kosovo today in great part under the control of Belgrade must not be partitioned off in fact while not being so in name
In order to reduce the blow dealt to Serbia the Security Council must avoid granting independence in such a convoluted manner that the new state cannot really function
If the Security Council fails to make a decision as to a final status it will create a critical situation Kosovo will declare its independence unilaterally and all the nations will have to decide whether or not to recognize the new country
If that happens it is highly likely that the Serbs in northern Kosovo will declare their own independence
At least Serbia will greatly campaign against any recognition
In fact the government of Serbia is already trying to convince the West to defer the decision until mid 2007
He claims that if Kosovo becomes independent the ultra nationalist Radical Party will rise to power in the coming elections and he believes that holding elections this year will prompt the Contact Group to reject his proposal in the Security Council
Moreover the government has encouraged the leaders of the Republika Srpska from Bosnia to threaten to hold their own referendum on the separation from a still fragile Bosnia
And they keep pressing in vain for the removal of Ahtisaari in order to extend the Vienna talks
The timing for the organisation of the constitutional referendum appears to be part of this dilatory strategy
Some hope that postponement will stimulate violence in Kosovo and will push the West to reconsider the independence of Kosovo
This tactic may be working
Many EU countries are worried about the implications of the withdrawal of territory from of a country as well as the impact of the independence of Kosovo on Serbian Democracy
Being given the political instability of Serbia they put in doubt the damage that would cause a delay in the short term which would be mainly self inflicted
But delaying the decision would only allow Kostunica to find new ways to make even more difficult a decision by the Security Council
The West should ignore the siren song of Belgrade
Serbian politics will be chaotic and unstable in the near future and the Serbian politicians will try to use this as an excuse to avoid facing the loss of Kosovo
Similarly establishing ties between Serbia and Kosovo whatever the circumstances will be problematic
But a failure to make a definitive decision today on the final status of Kosovo will produce a situation that is worse than in the Balkans will hold up Serbia s movement toward the West and its future accession to the EU will condemn Kosovo s ethnic minorities to a dangerous ambiguity and will endanger fragile nations such as Bosnia and Macedonia
The only realistic option for Kosovo is independence
If Serbia wants to rejoin the West it must not relinquish this opportunity by letting itself get trapped by its nationalist past
A new and dangerous beginning for South Korea
North Korea s decision to expel the UN atomic energy inspectors is one more reason to consider the election of Roh Moo Hyun to the presidency of South Korea two weeks earlier as a historic landslide
The beginning of his mandate does not only coincide with one of the most dangerous events of Korea for decades but his presidency will also hold spectator to a testing relationship between the U S and South Korea to a degree never achieved before
The victory of Roh on Lee Hoi Chang shows a generational change in the Korean policy with a young people determined to win a freedom of movement in its relations with the United States
In fact generation differences were the decisive factor in the presidential election race replacing the regional feelings that dominated every presidential race before it
According to a report more than 60 of the 20 to 30 year old population voted for Roh creating a gap of 2 3 in this presidential race which for the first time in 31 years found two men face to face fighting one on one
The populist and nationalist position of Roh will be quickly and severely tested by the reality when he takes his post in February
But if one associates the generational change that brought him to power with a strong popular will to continue with the commitments as regards North Korea beyond the fact that North Korea continues to strengthen its nuclear power and the recipe is complete for a disagreement with the United States
Roh a student who passed the bar examination without ever going to a university nor doing his duty has managed to convince voters that he would open a new era in politics reflecting a better South Korea enriched and with a strengthened middle class sweeping away the political games that are dominated by insiders regional disputes and the struggles of factions
His style and rhetoric put forth a new image for Korea of a man of the people engaged in eliminating the sclerotic networks of favoritism and corruption
For the first time in the modern history of Korea the presidential campaign has truly been the site of debates on the central issues which the country must face rather than focusing on the parties and personalities
The candidate Roh has called for new relations between South Korea and America based on the principle of independence and equality
Thus he announced no longer wanting to be an extension of the US nor to go to Washington to take the traditional photo He also promised to continue the policy of President Kim Dae Jung called the politics of the sun ray in its involvement with the North
It is remarkable that Roh won the election despite the decision of North Korea to reactivate its nuclear reactors arrested since 1994
A few years earlier that simple gesture would have condemned the candidacy of Roh
That he has overcome this obstacle without changing his position on engagement with North Korea shows that times have changed quite radically
The People s urgent desire for change rather than a comfortable situation has now become the main concern of North Korea
The Roh election campaign also benefited from a growing trend of anti Americanism
The acquittal by an American military tribunal of two American soldiers who accidentally killed two Korean schoolchildren on board their armored vehicle in June last year set off demonstrations in streets all across the country
Although President George W Bush apologized twice for the deaths of two girls demand continued to grow for modification of the agreement on the status of the armed forces Status of Force Agreement SOFA which governs the legal treatment reserved for American troops stationed in South Korea
The Koreans insist that the American soldiers who commit crimes should be judged by the Korean courts
This expression of wounded national pride was possible after the extraordinary performance of the South Korean team at soccer s World Cup last summer which helped convince the Koreans of the full maturity of their country and who thus can now defend themselves without the presence of 37 000 American soldiers
In fact many Koreans now see the American presence and not the communist regime of North Korea as the biggest obstacle to unification
According to a recent poll only 54 8 of Koreans still favour the maintenance of American troops in their country while 31 7 oppose it
These feelings will form part of the test of diplomacy which will give shape to the presidency of Roh since its inception because it needs to rethink the relationship between Korea and the United States even as the Bush administration is concerned about North Korea s nuclear ambitions and its role in the spread of weapons of mass destruction in rogue states
For now Korean voters apparently insensitive to threats posed by the nuclear weapons of North Korea support Roh s policy of maintaining dialogue and economic exchanges with the North
Under the presidency of Roh the domestic policy of South Korea and its relations with the United States and North Korea will necessitate an almost total revamping
Will he be able to walk the tightrope of maintaining security in the peninsula while remaining committed to America and keeping the support of his electorate
Knowing these targets would be a difficult test even for the most experienced and the most cynical politician then knowing if President Roh can succeed would be a good omen
Any failure however connotes so horrific outlook that nobody can really wish him that
To each his path towards peace
Over the next three weeks the Israeli army will engage in an exercise without precedent Instead of defending the country against external enemies or terrorists it is going to evacuate by force if necessary 9 000 Israelis in their homes
The unilateral withdrawal of Israel is the culmination of a deep political change caused by two convictions that are somewhat contradictory and which characterised the policies of the Prime Minister Ariel Sharon since 2003 first that the road map initially launched by the United States is going nowhere and then that the status quo is untenable
For Sharon there is no doubt that the 9 000 Jewish settlers who live among the 1 2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have no future
Therefore without negotiations a unilateral withdrawal is the only sensible approach to reducing violence and stabilisation
This policy has deeply disturbed Israel The settlers for most religious but not all have felt betrayed by Sharon the father of settlements
It is today the Israeli left although reluctantly that realises the new pragmatism preached by Sharon is perhaps the first step in the right direction
Just as de Gaulle in Algeria Sharon has redesigned the maps of the Israeli policy
The last few weeks have been the setting for massive demonstrations some of them nearly violent A number of settlers have declared that they would not obey the evacuation orders
The army and the police have mobilized nearly 50 000 soldiers to carry out the evictions successfully
This approach by force is traumatic not only for the settlers but also for many other Israelis
Only the next few days and weeks can tell us if the evacuation is going on peacefully or not
Meanwhile Sharon has paid dearly for his policy
Right wing parties have left the ruling coalition it has lost its majority in his own Likud party and its finance minister Benjamin Netanyahu has left its government
It is only by inviting Shimon Peres s Labour party into his Cabinet that Sharon managed to retain his parliamentary majority
The question evidently arises on the situation after the withdrawal from Gaza
Initially this retreat leaves many governments sceptical but they have come to realize as they say in Washington that this was the only thing to do
Among them as among the Palestinians some hope that after the withdrawal from Gaza it will be possible to return to the road map and resume negotiations that will lead to a final agreement between Israel and the Palestinians
It is a huge mistake
Even if he is motivated by the best intentions hopes to resurrect the road map is not realistic
Future negotiations will have to address the issue of final borders between Israel and Palestine the fate of the 200 000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank the status of Jerusalem and the problem of the Palestinian refugees of 1947 48
The chasm between the Israeli and Palestinian positions on these issues has not diminished since the unsuccessful negotiations at Camp David in 2000 while fear and lack of confidence have only grown
To try to enter into negotiations under such circumstances would not only be a futile exercise but could serve to further increase the alienation and suspicion on both sides
The failure of the Annan Plan for Cyprus suggests that good intentions are not enough and disagreements in Cyprus were miniscule compared to what divides Israelis and Palestinians
What is therefore possible
The only rational way to proceed is probably to recognize that the unilateral steps of each side can further promote the cause of reduced violence and final reconciliation
On the Israeli side other withdrawals of dozens of small isolated settlements from the West Bank causing the evacuation of 20 000 to 30 000 settlers could prove politically feasible and would provide the Palestinians with a contiguous territory in the West Bank
For the Palestinians consolidating control of a dozen security services and militias under the Palestinian Authority would be an significant step forward
The Palestinian leader Abu Mazen acknowledges it but the question is whether he is capable of it
The Palestinian Authority could also take the difficult path of telling the refugees that contrary to 50 years of Palestinian propaganda they will not return to Israel but will have to settle in the West Bank and Gaza areas that will become part of the ultimate Palestinian State
In an ideal world conflicts are resolved through agreements and treaties
But in real life as the examples of Cyprus Bosnia and Kosovo illustrate stabilization and the slow decline in violence can sometimes lead to the same goal even without formal agreement
Plausible fault of alternative one can only hope that it will be also the case for the Israelis and the Palestinians
A new world
BERLIN Like old horses becoming frisky again at the sound of the bugle the strategists of the Cold War feel their adrenalin rate increasing when missile defense is once again in the headlines
To be sure the anti missile defense proposed by Bill Clinton reluctantly and George W Bush enthusiastically and solidly backed by the American Congress does not resemble the Star Wars dream of Ronald Reagan 20 years ago the NMD nuclear missile defense an American anti missile defense system is only supposed to catch a modest number of warheads and thus does not furnish complete protection against enemy missiles
But the question revives the old debates about deterrence of mutual assured destruction and control of nuclear weapons and reanimates the rivalry between the nuclear powers at a time when nuclear weapons have lost much of their raison d etre
Strangely even while he is not certain that the missile defence programme concluded the debate rages on
Even if the system works it will take between 10 and 15 years perhaps more before it is operational
Things are also heating up about something which if it exists one day may only have little impact
Ordinarily cautious governments are now lining up as if the future awaited them in the wings
How can this strange behaviour be explained
Certainly not by a blind faith in technology
After all the history of missile defense is full of examples of technological disappointments for its supporters whether or not they are part of the government
No sane person can assume that what has never succeeded before that is destroying a small number of warheads in flight is going to happen overnight
Out of the three tests that were carried out so far one failed in part the other two completely it is the reason why President Clinton has preferred to pass the problem on to his successor
If President Bush is now as he mentioned working toward a new formula it will take even more time to develop the structure and design a testing program
And we cannot be sure that will work
Governments are worried at the present time not because of what will be possible or not but about the intentions real or supposed of America
Although the Americans say loud and clear that the missile defence programme is not aimed against anyone in particular that the only goal of the US is to protect their citizens from countries like Iraq or North Korea almost everyone is convinced of the opposite the Russians fear that Americans want to cement their military superiority and the inferiority of Russia permanently the Chinese fear that the missile defence programme is a sign of America s determination that Taiwan remain independent Europeans fear that America s plans will create tensions with Russia and between the United States of Europe
Because what is of primary importance is political intentions and not technical capabilities now that the missile defense program is creating problems it is pushing Russia to confrontation making China nervous and strengthening a European sense of a lack of unity with the United States
The damage begins at the starting line while the path remains uncertain
The political consequences are further reinforced by the fact that thirty years ago the United States and the Soviet Union gave up on establishing an effective defense against strategic nuclear missiles
Normally an American defense project still in an embryonic state should not cause as much excitement as the NMD
But the 1972 Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty banning for an undetermined amount of time systems designed to protect both of these two countries against such nuclear attacks
Given the way the United States proceeds with the nuclear missile defense program it will either have to violate the treaty or give six months advance notice to condemn it which the two signatories are entitled to do if they feel it is vital to their security
In the eyes of many it would mean that America chooses to abandon the structure of the control of nuclear weapons built during the last part of the Cold War
The Bush administration claims that because the Cold War is over the formal disappearance of the ABM Treaty would not endanger nuclear stability
But the stability is as well as a problem of perception policy than of technical calculations
By limiting the antimissile strategy the old treaty offers some insurance of desuasion for the governments that have nuclear weapons
Its demise would affect all other agreements on weapons controls
Russia threatens of tearing them all up if the US leave the ABM treaty
Even if this threat lacks credibility it would first be harmful to Russian interests it rests on a certain logic
The main question posed by the NMD is not how to prepare for a world missile defense but how to alleviate the concerns regarding current policies
A few attempts are made quietly in the background
Legal experts in Washington suggest that a moderate amount of preparation for missile construction and radar sites does not violate the ABM Treaty and therefore does not force the United States to denounce it
For now the Bush administration will wait for the test results before making a decision
Moscow and Washington both suggested that a deep cut to their offensive nuclear arsenal is possible
The assurance that the United States will include them in the deliberations makes the sceptical European allies more indulgent
The most important of the measures meant to gain trust a modification of the ABM Treaty in order to allow a limited antimissile defense is being studied
The previous nyet from Russia might not turn out to be final
Thus the political turmoil which Russia and Europe are involved in will perhaps calm down
But China
It is not part of an alliance like Europe or a network of arms control treaties with which political solutions can be found such as Russia and it is a contributing factor to the instability in Asia and the nervousness in China
There the trust can only be built on a rapprochement between China and the United States
Unfortunately there is nothing to indicate that Washington was aware of the gravity of the problem
The old cold war planners are very disappointed by it all
As they revise the vocabulary and abbreviations of the royal era of deterrence they discover that it is a lost world
The missile defence does not threat strategic stability between the US and Russia but if it is poorly presented it endangers the long term political vision
In announcing its determination to carry out a future missile defense program the United States has created a policy storm that it must deal with now if it wants to avoid the worst of the damage
To avoid a lost generation
A little bit everywhere unemployed young people adrift are a cause for worry
They are a problem in developing countries which have an increasingly strong population explosion the equivalent of baby boom in the West at the end of the second world war
But the period that followed the war in most developed countries has been an era of unprecedented prosperity for the baby boom that now approaches retirement
Will the future also be promising for the 1 billion and a some odd young people aged 12 to 24 years in developing countries
These countries should with all possible urgency combine the investments and the political measures necessary to encourage young people to get training find work remain in good health start a family and exercise their citizenship
The benefit is considerable if they succeed accelerated development thanks to the contribution of a young population and a decrease in the dependency rate
In East Asia this demographic dividend is said to be the cause of more than a quarter of the economic growth in the region
Developing countries have already invested a lot as far as younger people are concerned
They are now better educated and healthier than previous generations
More than 80 of children go to primary school compared to 50 in 1970 and infant mortality has fallen from more than 10 to 6 5 during the same period
But governments should not be satisfied with investing on behalf of children they must also begin to deal with the new generation of young people
However in countries where the vast majority of children complete primary education few of them have access to secondary school
The young represent half of new cases of HIV infection
In the Middle East and North Africa a quarter of young people are without work
All this raises difficult questions what is it that hinders access to secondary education
Is it illiteracy that sometimes remains high even at the end of primary school or the lack of resources
Why are there not more young people who know how to protect themselves against AIDS
Why do companies in these countries often complain of a shortage of skilled labour when so many students find themselves unemployed upon leaving university
An effective policy directed toward the young is based on three different types of action more opportunities for success offered to young people more skills and the offer of a second chance
Governments must offer more possibility for success to young people by improving the access to and quality of care and education
It s only in secondary school that students benifit of there primary school teachings
However many young people are still unprepared for the secondary and positions are rare
Today employers want highly skilled workers
In countries as diverse as Algeria Bangladesh Brazil China Estonia and Zambia qualifications and inadequate training are difficult obstacles to overcome
If you want to prevent young people getting caught up in jobs without any hope of promotion or simply having no employment they must be able to enjoy a better education and training that meets the needs of companies
Many countries are now trying to facilitate access to secondary high school education particularly through conditional aid programs that allow for the distribution of funds to poor families whose children attend school regularly
These programs have helped increase the number of pupils in secondary school in Mexico Ecuador Bangladesh and Cambodia
But for these programmes to have a purpose the pupils must have the skills necessary to enter secondary school
In Morocco for example more than 80 of children accomplish a first round of education but less than 20 reach the required level
The measures are also needed to help young people make good decisions
Although a government cannot replace the parents or the community it can incite young people and their families to take care of themselves
With the necessary information and adequate encouragement the young will be better equipped to make decisions as to their health and their future
In Cameroon Horizon Jeunes a program on sexual hygiene intended for the young people in the cities helped to increase their knowledge in this area and change their behavior Thus the rate of young women insisting on the use of condoms rose from 58 to 76 in the group that took part in the program
Another example in the Dominican Republic the rate of enrollment in high schools increased when students were informed of the amount of money earned by those who finished their secondary education an amount that they had greatly underestimated
In Bangladesh the assistance project for the female secondary school has financially helped girls aged 11 to 14 to continue their studies and delay their marriage
Governments should also offer a second chance to young people who have failed because of circumstances or bad choices
The corresponding programmes must be well designed well targeted and coordinated in a way that provides adequate support to their beneficiaries
And so in sub Saharan Africa thousands of young fighters 100 000 in Sudan alone hope to rebuild their lives for peacetime but they are obviously in need of training and employment medical care and psychological support
With political will measures based on the efforts of the young people themselves to increase their chances of success and their skills and the offer of a second chance to those who need it these countries could maximize their demographic advantage
They can either seize this opportunity for growth to improve their development prospects or take the risk of a lost generation embittered at the lack of a future
End with European paternalism
The Italian President of the European Union bears a huge responsibility that of reinvigorating the expansion as an essential aspect of the new EU
The best place to start would be to encourage a better attitude towards adopting the Euro by the countries entering the Union
In fact the paternalistic attitude of EU institutions to the country homebuyers threatens to create a two tier Europe which will complicate the process of integration
The conceding countries have held their market share by achieving trade integration with EU countries that are more advanced than other countries
Three of them Estonia Latvia and Lithuania have a currency board system or a fixed exchange rate with the euro like Bulgaria which must join the EU in 2007
The others have shown their interest for several years in adopting the euro from the beginning unilaterally in some cases even before they enter the EU a position openly advocated by the National Bank of Poland and to a lesser degree by the National Bank of Hungary and the National Bank of the Czech Republic
However despite their progress in getting their rates of inflation and interest closer to European levels a good many candidate countries fear that with the total openness required for accession to the EU they will be exposing themselves to the risk of sudden stoppages of capital flow and to currency crises
They have learned the lessons of Latin America and Asia in the 1990s
The euro adoption would very easily permit them to escape such risks and to focus their efforts on the creation of a real growth for their economies
However the response of the European institutions and especially the European Central Bank and the European Commission was negative the candidates were made to understand that they must first pass two years in the European exchange rate mechanism ERM II where candidates for the Euro would have to show what their policies were able to accomplish
At the start even the currency boards were seen as unacceptable though as is often the case in Europe exceptions have been made countries with a currency board could keep them even after union membership
The opposition of the ECB and the Commission for the early adoption of the euro is ill informed
What should count for the European Union remains that the policies of any member state are not harmful to the other member states
As Leszek Balcerowicz governor of the National Bank of Poland pointed out the adoption of the Euro by the candidate countries will certainly benefit them while in the worst case having absolutely no effect on the current members
Indeed the combined economic weight of all the candidate nations is much too small only 6 of GDP of the expanded EU to exert any effect whatsoever on the Euro
However the continuing opposition to EU institutions has led most of the candidate nations to abandon the idea of adopting the Euro unilaterally or as soon as possible after their entry into the Union
Unfortunately the persistence of the ECB and of the Commission now provide ammunition to populist governments in the accessing countries who rely on the variation in exchange rates to escape fiscal discipline that implies adopting the euro
However such fiscal manoeuvers probably discalify a country that wants to go quickly in the euro zone
In fact member nations which have not established a spending cap have seen their budget deficits soar beyond 9 of GDP in Hungary in 2002 and more than 5 in Poland Czech Republic and Slovakia while significant capital movements have exerted strong pressure on their currencies causing them to rise
This trend sets out the real economies of the candidate countries to the risks of reversal of capital flows and exchange crises that an early adoption of the euro would eliminate
Ironically the candidate nations find themselves being lectured to by officials of the ECB and the Commission on the compromise between nominal convergence and real convergence
It would appear that Brussels only imperative is the targeted growth of candidate countries and that macroeconomic stability can wait
Large budget deficits support growth and inflation is clearly not a problem
If this reasoning sounds familiar it is perhaps because it repeats more or less the foundations of the non sustainable planning system in which the accession of candidate countries was suspended in the early 1990s
It was of course the adoption of economic policies that focused on market forces in the former communist countries who brought them to the gates of EU membership
Thus the European institutions should abandon their paternalistic approach and take the concerns of the central banks of candidate countries seriously on the subject of the risks associated with maintaining their own currency over a long period during which their economy must be fully opened up to the movement of capital
Today the ECB and the European Commission give their de facto support to the positions of the populist governments in Eastern Europe which are already spending the funds they expect to get from the EU in the future
It is high time that European institutions address in a more serious fashion the challenges and opportunities expansion presents
They may start by considering the early adoption of the Euro by the candidate countries in a more favorable eye both for countries with a currency board system for those using a floating exchange rate
Blair s European disaster
When the Dutch and French voters rejected the proposed EU constitution everyone quickly realised that the European project was in a difficult situation
The painful battle of last week in regard to the medium term future of the budget of the Union has further confirmed this verdict
She also regretfully brought an end to the British presidency of the European Council recalling that Britain continues to maintain its long standing reputation of standing apart from the European Union
The two facts are inextricably linked
In France and Holland voters have not explained why they voted against the draft constitution
However many commentators have believed that this vote expressed their protest against the admission of the ten new states which was felt to be too hasty especially with respect to the poorest countries of central and eastern Europe
More specifically it would seem that the voters have been afraid of losing their jobs to swarms of immigrants coming from the East This fear has been widely illustrated during this time by the image of the inexpensive Polish plumber
The irony of course is that most of the fifteen old member states have refused to the new member states full and immediate access to Western job markets
In any case it was too late to protest since the ten eastern countries had actually become full European Union members
But now the 25 states must face the economic consequences of this growth not only on the issue of the size of the entire European budget for the next seven years but also on the distribution of donor and recipient countries
The key issue above all is knowing how much the older member states are prepared to pay to boost the lagging economies of the new member states
In fact the battle took place on three fronts and opposed Britain France and the new member states
Traditionally a large majority of the budget went to agriculture and regions where development was lagging
In practice huge sums of money have been attributed whether to the major agricultural producers whether to the poorest members such as Greece and Portugal
At these two levels the new member states expected to benefit significantly from the EU system
Previously in budgetary terms the biggest loser as a result of the European measures was the United Kingdom At the time when two thirds of European spending was going toward agriculture its agricultural sector was weak and therefore the British benefitted little from European agricultural subsidies
For a long time they have complained about the unfairness of these rules especially since at that time the United Kingdom was one of the poorest members It is in 1984 that the conservative government of Margaret Thatcher demanded and obtained a massive rebate on the net contribution of Britain to the EU budget
Today the situation has changed in three key points First the reform of the European agricultural policy has begun and the proportion of the European agricultural budget has fallen from 60 to 40
Then for many years Britain had a faster economic growth than most other member states so that it has become one of the richest countries in the EU even in comparison with France and Germany Finally the new member states are so much poorer that the poorest of the old member states that they have a moral argument weight to ask a for a generous budget negotiation
The start of negotiations six months ago coincides with the start of the presidency of the European Council
Tony Blair British Prime Minister has galvanized politicians in Europe by declaring before Parliament in Brussels that he was passionately pro European
That was the message that the British pro Europeans hoped for a long time and that they expected vainly since the election of Blair in 1997
Of course he never expressed such a feeling when he was actually in Great Britain over the course of the last eight years
In addition since Britain has been one of the strongest advocates of expansion regarding the countries of central and eastern Europe one might have expected that during budget negotiations the Blair government would have behaved with a proportional amount of generosity and enthusiasm towards the new entrants
Initially this seemed to be the tactics chosen by the British government
But contrary to all expectations it adopted an ethically advantageous position in proposing to give up part of its budget rebate on the sole condition that the rest of the European Union and France in particular agree on the fundamental reforms in terms of European agricultural policy
It took time for the British to understand that since President Jacques Chirac was a shaky and desperate president remaining in the Élysée until 2007 but possessing no power he did not have the means to make such a bargain
Once the British became aware of this harsh reality they played their pitiful last card in the handling of the negotiations They made ridiculously paltry offers all primarily designed to safeguard Britain s petty interests and did so mainly at the expense of the new member states
How sad conclusion to a presidency opened with great fanfare six months ago by the statements passionately pro European of Tony Blair
The full text of his speech is clear
Blair is favorable toward Europe but not toward this one
He wants to be part of a political Europe but only if the other member countries agree to follow the model of economic and social reform
The problem is that economic and social reform is purely and simply a matter of national policy and is not part of the powers of the Union If such a reform must take place in France or in Germany this issue would be discussed only between politicians and the French or German voters
It could be within the competence of the Union only if the EU becomes a real federation
Can you say Blair is a federalist then
Of course not
It is mostly a mindless nationalist who lives in fear of the sneaky tabloid press in his country
Then why did he assert his pro European fervor
Maybe he didn t reflect on the issue in the end
Europe in the challenge of neoliberalism
For more than 20 years I have argued that the high rates of unemployment in Western Europe could not persist
At the end of the 1970s monetarists made a bet that only a modest and temporary increase in unemployment could contain the rampant and open ended inflation of the industrial West and that with this recession the cost of the return to effective price stability would have proved worthwhile
In Britain and the United States this monetarist challenge has seen a happy ending
Not in Western Europe
Over the past 25 years European unemployment has increased as the monetary policy does and interest rates were raised to combat inflation
But while inflation has yielded unemployment has not fallen or almost not
Even if the unemployment rate has not reached the level of the Great Depression it has remained high enough to make long term unemployment or the fear of long term unemployment a truly disturbing experience
The governments of societies in which the official unemployment rate remains at 10 or more for several generations have poor economic management
Consequently it seemed to me for 20 years that the balancing act underlying the policy in Western Europe collective bargaining and generous social insurance on one hand and tight monetary policies on the other was doomed to crack
The European policymakers seem paralyzed by a double fear
Europe s central bankers fear that their political masters order them to relax their monetary policy that the structural reforms needed to release the aggregate offer be not given and that this results in a return to the inflation of the 1970s
In short they fear that all the sacrifices made to stabilize prices have been fruitless
Politicians in Western Europe on their part fear the opposite effect
They are concerned with the idea that even after undertaking structural reforms to reduce the attractiveness of unemployment insurance and motivate workers to go to businesses and companies to workers central bankers will continue to press for tightening the purse strings
In short they fear that without increased production and employment the net effect will simply be an increase in poverty
Of course these fears are accompanied with the hope that the structural reforms and monetary expansion work in harmony provoking a boom in employment and production without causing substantial increase in inflation
But the reality is that not any move towards the loosening of monetary policy has been put in place particularly with the novice European Central Bank keen to assert its credibility in the fight against inflation and that attempts to structural reforms are hesitant cut and undertaken without enthusiasm
I have been wrong for 20 years Western European regimes have remained stable despite the exclusion of a large proportion of citizens from meaningful participation in the economic life
The growth of economies in Western Europe countries has continued despite the heavy burden that is 10 unemployed but did not do so as quickly as it could
Today it seems I am finally right if it s not time to panic at least it s time for me to worry
The French have rejected the EU constitution above all at least according to appearances because a greater European integration is feared to result into enormous costs and the disruption of neoliberalism
It s one thing to support the European project when it comes to linking Germany and France so closely that nobody considers it worthwhile anymore to go to war to determine what language should be spoken in Alsace Lorraine
It is another matter when the European project means that French workers will have to face competition from Polish plumbers Roumanian farmers and Turkish vendors
In Germany voters seem poised to evict the Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder because his lukewarm allegiance to the neo liberal project displeases them
The problem is that they may find themselves governed for four years by Angela Merkel a Chancellor almost as committed to the neo liberal project as I am
I believe that Germany would be better in ten years with more neoliberal policies
But that does not appear to match the desire of German voters making it impossible to predict what German politics will be like in four years
Besides you have to add in the displeasure of northern Europe with respect to the central bankers particularly of the ECB and with respect to the Euro
Not that the end of the European monetary union is decided but it is simply that some have begun to consider a bleak future where the end of the EMU would be put to the program
This is enough to shake asset prices around the world
The successes of Western Europe since World War II are among the most impressive and the most encouraging success of world history
Everyone should hope that the united Europe today builds on these successes rather than see generations of high unemployment rates put them in danger
For this the ECB s attitude will have to change
Europe needs a monetary policy considering that the decrease in the Northern European unemployment rate is more important than the price stability of the continent
The southern and eastern Europe will suffer inflation it is unavoidable because as the regions develop and industrialize the terms of trade improve and under the auspices of a monetary union regional inflation can become a barrier to overcome
The ECB should not try to balance the inflation in the southern and eastern with the deflation of the north attempting to reach artificial targets in the scale of the entire continent
Rescued by taxes
What do we owe to our great great great grandchildren
What measures do we have to take today to reduce the risks posed to our descendants and our planet by the increasing likelihood of global warming and of climate change
Almost all the world except for Exxon Mobil US Vice President Dick Cheney their appointed servants and their manipulated acolytes understands that when human beings burning hydrocarbons the carbon dioxide escapes into the atmosphere where it acts as a massive cover that absorbs the infrared radiation emitted underneath resulting in the warming of the planet
Similarly almost everyone understands that global warming could be whether more serious or less serious than existing models suggest but that this uncertainty is not an excuse to do nothing
In fact it should instead prompt us to better protect ourselves if we knew that global warming would occur exactly according to the average projections
Finally almost everyone agrees that governments nonprofit organizations and oil companies should designate more money for research on carbon dioxide emission free energy technologies or those able to remove pollutants from the atmosphere and oceans cooling the planet by reflecting more solar radiation
It is clear that it is the rich countries which must shoulder the burden of solving the problem of climate change over the course of the coming generations
After all they were allowed access to industrialization and wealth by polluting blithely
Today China India and other fast developing countries do not have this freedom of movement and it would be unfair to penalize them
It is time now to build not dismantle or undermine the international institutions which will have to manage our response to climate change in the coming years
But should we do something different now and during the next decade
Economists like to think in terms of cost
And when they note a behavior with destructive side effects they like to tax it
The tax forces people to feel the damage they cause where it hurts in the pocketbook
Imposing a tax on those who drive 4x4s in the city for example is a way to spur the collective intelligence to decide that adverse side effects are a good reason to change its behavior
But it must be a fair tax
A 4x4 that runs through 17 miles in the city and uses 3 7 litres of petrol pumps about 3 kilograms of bioxyde of carbon into the atmosphere
Should the greenhouse tax be 0 010 0 38 or 1 15 per litre
This choice will be determined by what we will learn over the years but today the amount of tax stems more from a philosophical question how much do we think we owe our distant descendants
Australian economist John Quiggin posted an informative discussion on his Web site
However critics of this calculation stress that the world today is poor The average annual per capita at purchasing power parity stands at about 5 500
One expects the improvement of technologies and their dissemination to make the world much richer by 2100 With an annual growth of 2 percent it will reach almost 40 000 euros per head in terms of 2006 purchasing power
These critics argue therefore we have much more need today of this 55 marginal expense than people richer in 2100 will need the 400 that they would earn by being preserved the effects of climate change
But what critics often fail to mention is that the same logic applies to today s world
The average annual per capita income is now around 30 600 in the US Japan and Western Europe and less than 4 600 for half of the poorest people in the world
The same logic according to which we need 55 today more than people from 2100 quote will need the additional 400 means the rich should be taxed more since every additional 380 in taxes in rich countries corresponds to an increase in per capita income of 55 in poor countries
In other words if the rich are stingy today toward our much richer descendants and if we decide to let them get by with an ecological disaster we must now be generous with the poor of this world
Conversely if we are greedy today with the poor we need to be generous with our descendants
At least that is what we should do if our actions are based more on moral principles than on the leitmotif of Leonid Brezhnev What we have taken we keep
Take pharmacovigilance seriously
Health threats nuclear reactors firearms and contaminated food threaten all of us it is why governments are playing an active role in limiting them by means of regulations which are often successful
But the situation is very different when it comes to the safety of prescription only medicine
In fact for the regulator the pharmacovigilance is the forgotten relation of public protection
The scope of the problem is yet enormous
In the United States alone it is estimated that side effects are responsible for the deaths of 100 000 patients each year
If these figures are valid it means that deaths caused by drugs rank fourth or fifth among the leading causes of death according to the mortality estimates used
In addition the annual hospital costs directly attributable to adverse effects would run into the billions of dollars not to mention the suffering caused by side effects which don t lead to hospitalization or death
The difficulties of determining causes and effects should be taken into account
It is sometimes difficult to know if the death or hospitalization of a patient is attributable to a particular drug the underlying illness or a combination of both
This phenomenon only underlines the need to ensure the safety of medicines
The fact that all drugs in addition to their benefits produce adverse effects in some patients is one reason why pharmacovigilance exists
It is necessary to weigh carefully the beneficial and undesired effects of medicines before approving them and using them
These judgments vary depending on whether they are issued by a pharmaceutical company which expects the benefits of its sales or by a patient who risks suffering a serious side effect
The incomplete nature of knowledge complicates this estimate
The rush to put new medicines on the market often leads to an incomplete research on their safety
More than half of approved drugs cause a serious side effect that was unknown at the time they were authorized for sale
One example when the new class of analgesics called Cox 2 inhibitors was put on the market regulators doctors and patients were unaware that these medicines could cause heart attacks and strokes
Tens of thousands of innocent patients perhaps more have suffered from side effects before the withdrawal of the first two drugs in this class
It is difficult to provide a complete and appropriate list of the harmful effects of drugs
The rate of spontaneous alerts to the regulatory agencies is low around 1 and controls are passive in many countries
One must also count with the general reluctance to report the adverse effects of drugs
Doctors sometimes feel guilty and fear trials and pharmaceutical companies are concerned about threats to their profits The regulatory agencies must confront the question why this drug has been allowed
It is particularly difficult to blame adverse reactions to a drug when the symptom is common in the age group of the user or treated disease
Because the risk of heart attack is important in the elderly many suffer from arthritis related pain requiring treatment with painkillers it took six years to make the link between Cox 2 inhibitors and a multiplication by two or three risk of heart attacks
A recent Harris poll in the United States concluded that 60 of adults are either not very convinced or not convinced at all that drug manufacturers disclose their information on the undesirable side effects of their products
This scepticism is justified internal documents obtained from recent trials show that pharmaceutical companies often fail to submit critical safety information to the regulatory agencies as the law requires and fail to pass this information along to doctors and patients
One of the problems is that the consequences of this neglect of the harmful effects of drugs are nonexistent or minimal
It is time to be serious
Citizens and governments must make pharmacovigilance a priority and commit the resources needed to solve the problem
The penalties imposed on pharmaceutical companies which fail to raise an alert and provide information on the safety of their medicines should be increased substantially to make them an effective deterrent
The agencies in charge must have the means of enforcing the laws in order to implement stricter regulations
Pharmacovigilance s problem has to be considered a failure of the system
It is not fair to blame serious adverse effects on doctors particularly in the absence of comprehensive information on the safety of medicines
The full cooperation of doctors is essential to solve the problem but it means an end to their fear of being dragged in court
This approach works well in the aviation industry the pilots who point out the mistakes that they have nearly made are not penalized
Patients must be better informed about the risks of medicines that are prescribed to them and more involved in their diagnosis and their reporting
Instructions printed in tiny letters are useless
the control of side effects should be more proactive
This calls for more funding which should come from the main beneficiaries of the sale of medicines the pharmaceutical industry in the same way as the monitoring of air safety is funded by the airlines
Above all else improving pharmaco vigilance will depend if we want the efforts to succeed upon the establishment of an independent body designed to promote coordinate and give advice to the program of regulation
The office exists in the United Kingdom
Other governments should follow this model in order to fulfill their role neglected so far as the guardian of public health
The virtual enemy
Five years have passed since the terrorist attacks of September 2001 on New York and Washington and yet it seems that policymakers have learned little about how terrorist cells work and their weaknesses
The Bush administration always uses the expression war against terrorism and behaves as if it were really a regular kind of war where one government is in combat with another
However after five years of military efforts strategies based on the targeting of a single opponent have only worsened the situation
It is time to understand the new model of conflict that is currently emerging
So that the paradigm war would work the Bush administration referred to al Qaeda as a definite enemy
In reality there is no great organiser or financing of terrorist activity
The attacks in Madrid Bali and London and several attempts thwarted the United States and Great Britain were all marked by their scattered organisation
It is conspiracies generated independently who have used the resources of ad hoc often at home
These small operations also lacked a common internal pattern
The motives of terrorists differ from cell to cell even from person to person
Individuals can be motivated by profit or the thirst for power or for political and religious reasons while others are acting out of hatred or out of high anxiety
In addition there are big differences in terms of risks rewards and imperatives as one climbs the organizational chain or moves from one unit to another
Conventional military models are equipped to decapitate something which in this particular case has no head
The features of this new structure have already been studied in very different circumstances
Terrorism is the violent version of an agile virtual company
A virtual company is a small group that assemble alone in an organization just large enough to implement a collective intention
Virtual companies are unusually innovative and in business they are doubtless the only system capable of effectively creating a unique product
The industry of film production is a blatant example of this
In fact it is without a doubt the business model of the future
Profits from virtual corporations come from their casualness in terms of stability
At present most of the price of a product finances the huge and inefficient organization which assembled it
Almost all the creativity and problem solving occur in small businesses and are integrated later by big companies those whose infrastructure is expensive and fragile and that retain the bulk of profits
This model is the basis of the business world today just as centralization has been its preferred defense strategy
When you buy a General Motors car 80 cents of every dollar spent goes back to GM which manages itself almost alone
Small suppliers provide you in fact with 80 of the value and innovation but only receive 20 of the reward
Ironically in depth research on alternative models has been funded by the US Department of Defense which as the biggest buyer of complex machinery in the world wanted better quality goods cheaper and made to order besides
This research uncovered the requirements and mechanisms necessary for facilitating the autonomous establishment of small opportunistic groups and for enabling them to act like large companies
Unfortunately the research programme was cancelled before its findings could be applied to the business world surely because it threatened big business
It is often forgotten that American Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld has abandoned a comfortable retirement to reorganize the American army into a smaller and more agile force using some of these ideas
But the organisation of the invasion of Iraq for which Rumsfeld had recommended the use of fewer troops than expected shows a poor understanding of distributed systems
While the troops were deployed with the goal of a quick and easy entry and exit the Bush administration ended up using them for an old style occupation
The terrorists have shown a greater talent for capitalizing on the distributed models of operations
A multitude of books is coming out in the Muslim world on strategic studies of jihad
The most famous in the West is the Management of Savagery the management of brutality but only because it has been translated and made public
These books and the trends they indicate are becoming less dogmatic and increasingly complex in terms of adoption of the modern techniques of management
Their research will surely include the young science of management of the virtual company how to feed and support self organized cells
The first lesson for decision makers in the West to learn is perhaps the virtual companies rely on a culture of trust
Some kinds of confidence can be based on an artificial concept of not us rather than real values and direct experience
This is why the actions of the Bush administration only reinforce the dynamics of online terrorist activity
Bush s rhetoric them and us clearly defines an other and positions it as a cohesive enemy
His war approach helps Islamic terrorists consider the West as a force just as united and malicious
In the future the model of the virtual company will shape the way business will be conducted the way wars will be fought and probably the way government services will be administered
He promises to separate financial management from production management which would imply increased innovation and more rapid economic growth
However if Western governments do not develop a deep understanding of how to operate these structures they have no chance of combatting agile terrorist activity
Expansion as a solidarity
Nowadays it is often said that the European Union s sense of solidarity has been put in danger not to say that it has exploded by expanding to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
With Bulgaria and Romania approaching their turn to gain entry into the EU and with the negotiations which have to be opened with Turkey and Croatia it has become essential to call this notion into question
The values and interests of the new EU members are most often consistent with those of the first 15 states
It is true of course that expansion has fundamentally changed the Union and gave birth to new problems and political questions
However the new member states of Central and Eastern Europe are deeply embedded in the economic social and cultural development of our continent
The ties that bind us have been eroded by 40 years of Soviet rule but this has not changed fundamentally the European nature of these countries
My country Poland has always had deep cultural ties with other European countries particularly France
We participated in all the major European developments in terms of music literature and cinema such as for example Andrzej Wajda s Solidarity era films such as Danton a French co production
In sports too eastern Europeans have for a long time been included with the rest of Europe
Indeed before the first world war the national football team in Germany was entirely composed of players with Polish surnames
But above all there is a profound sense among the Poles the Hungarians and the Czechs as well as others who all feel they are Europeans
Which is the true meaning of the word solidarity as the Petit Robert dictionary defines it relationship between people who are aware of a commonality of interest
Solidarity as meaning a unit resulting from common interests also clearly exists in the 15 original members that members of the enlarged Union today
The exceptions prove the rule
The lack of unity in the European Union on the Iraq issue should not overshadow the agreements that the member states have reached on all the other important issues of international affairs
For the economic questions disagreements on a single regulation of the European Union for example should not obscure the fact that no member state new or historic has ever challenged the EU market
Finally the enlargement process itself is clearly a symbol of a social civil and cultural European unity
The fact that it provoked debate and discussion does not contradict the conviction shared by all old and new member states alike that they have an obligation to rebuild a continent after 40 years of division
There remain a few questions which if they are not the source of basic division are disturbing
Should we fear that Europe is now a continent purely Judeo Christian and white
Will the European Union s citizens whose origins are in other continents and whose religion is Hindu Muslim Sikh or Buddhist be able to identify with European values and culture
Are they able to feel European as the Poles and Czechs have always done
These questions are especially valuable in fact they cannot be avoided in the case of Turkey s possible admission to the European Union
Is European integration driven by respect for the values of others
Is it a matter of sharing them or contributing to it
These are tricky questions
They are particularly difficult if we look at culture as the cement of Europe s future
All European countries probably thought at the beginning that non European newcomers would be assimilated in the same way that the Polish immigrants were assimilated in the Ruhr German in the 19th century
The fact that this has not happened at least on a large scale does not mean that this cannot happen
One should only look at the number of respectable citizens of Turkish origin living in Germany
Or the large number of second generation British Indians and Pakistanis that we now see wearing a tie laptop in hand always between two aircraft
Europeans must however admit that these people represent only a minority
A number of groups of immigrants in Europe are themselves rejected by their communities because of the impossible social and economic integration
The constant threat of terrorism has made the insulation of Islamist groups in Europe even more dramatic
The European Union cannot simply declare solidarity a core value and do nothing to encourage it among those who feel marginalized
They must be allowed also to feel this relationship between people who are aware of a community of interest
The European solidarity cannot survive this neglect and will not survive it
After Kyoto
The treaty of the Kyoto Protocol is now in force for the 126 nations who have signed it so far
It is now time to begin to question the following how to bring all the nations including the major emitters to discuss what actions to undertake after after the expiration of the treaty in 2012
That is exactly what the European Commission has done recently in unveiling its first strategy for a post Kyoto era which will be examined by the European Council this coming March
While the Kyoto Protocol is only a modest reduction of carbon emissions in industrialized countries 5 2 between 2008 and 2012 compared to 1990 levels with variable targets depending on the country real progress can be made by supporting the development efforts and preserving our planet
In the first place all countries must include climate concerns in the planning of their policies and improve their governance in key sectors such as energy infrastructure and transport
In other words we must act by being aware that climate change and its effects on the inhabitants of rich and poor countries remain a threat to world security
Ultimately the long term approach will probably include a system based on some rules a system of incentives and some investments in the area of technological change
The adaptation at national level will be increasingly recognised as a major issue that will require adequate funding
The treatment of the effects of climate change and the treatment of emissions reductions should not rule each other out but be complementary
Imagining the post Kyoto world will offer us a chance to start a new dialogue and to consider new options for climate change
The nations could establish a more ambitious goal which would be to limit long term change in the Earth s temperature then allocate emissions rights among countries so as to ultimately restrict temperature increases to an acceptable level
That would require to increase energy research and development in order to develop both new and better technologies a process that must be supported by more solid partnerships between the public and private
Until now with only 15 of the world population rich countries are responsible for more than 75 of global emissions of carbon dioxide CO2 and therefore most of the environmental damage
It is however developing countries and therefore poor countries around the world who are most vulnerable
It is unrealistic to ask the poor countries where more than 1 6 billion people do not have access to energy and clean technologies to support the costs associated with technological change as expected
In collaboration with its partners the World Bank supports financial strategies which aim to help developing countries regulate costs due to climate change
To date more than 1 billion invested in GEF projects Global Environment Facility funds for the global environment and around 8 billion placed in co financing have been used in programs related to climate change
While the regulatory mechanisms of Kyoto and the European system of tradeable emissions European Trading Scheme have contributed to the creation of an emerging market for carbon trading interested parties are now worried about the immediate future
Without regulatory framework after 2012 the new opportunities for engaging transactions based on projects will end by 2006 2007
Given the long delay between the preparation of projects and the first benefits of emission reductions project developers only have a few years to act before carbon payments stop making a significant contribution to financing projects in the current context
The development of projects related to infrastructure is a long process that requires between 3 and 7 years from identification via licensing financing and construction to the first certification of reductions in carbon emissions
The projects must therefore be operational by 2007 at the latest
The World Bank has greatly contributed to forward the financing of carbon as a tool of sustainable development and to facilitate private sector s participation in the market
The Bank is focused on the representation of the interests of its borrowing countries helping them to develop assets for the carbon trade according to their own priorities
But without the involvement of governments to limit greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2012 the carbon market will remain uncertain and the private sector indispensable to the success of the market should not extend its participation in a significant and lasting manner
According to a recent study of companies interested in the financing of carbon commissioned by the World Bank only one company out of five surveyed said that it was interested in emissions reductions after 2012
We now have the opportunity to turn toward the future and mobilize the global community all of the countries without exception albeit with different responsibilities in the quest for a safer world a world which would avoid the terrible risks of the environmental degradation and social conflict that go along with inaction
State of the art or art of the State
September is traditionally the month when orchestras and opera companies leave the festivals of Aix Salzburg Tanglewood and many others to return home
This season is also marked on both sides of the Atlantic by the return of concerns as to the means of financing classical music
The American Symphonic life is eurocentric in almost all areas except for its funding
While Americans depend on private donations deductible from tax and revenue to fund classical music performances Europeans prefer direct governmental support
Ironically while the defenders of the arts in the United States have long demanded the adoption of the European model which has produced a rich and varied artistic lifestyle Europe is being forced to change course and to guide its support system towards greater dependence on private money and revenue
Unfortunately the European system of direct government funding is a victim of slow European economic growth and budget deficits
The problem is especially for countries that have adopted the euro as public spending in the art sector will be limited during a time by the obligation to keep the deficit below 3 of GDP
The resulting pressure on the European institutions performing arts causes concern on several levels
Traditionally the European social democracies prefer to distribute scarce goods and services such as concerts and operas according to a queue system financed by huge subsidies to keep prices low rather than by the willingness of each to pay
That will change from now on
Supporters of the Performing Arts in Europe point to the United States where among others even major orchestra conductors must actively participate in seeking funding and play an active role in the local community on behalf of the orchestra
They fear that the same thing will happen in Europe
Some conductors refusing to handle the begging bowl at the same time as the baton refused important positions in the United States for this reason believing that it would upset their art
It is said that Daniel Barenboim left the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in part because he objected to the demands for fundraising that were put upon him
But the North American experience shows that getting big names in the art world like the heads of orchestras to participate in fundraising does not necessarily harm the artistic aspect of the profession
Michael Tilson Thomas in San Francisco for example has combined effective fundraising with artistic direction to place the San Francisco Symphony as one of North America s top orchestras
The Europeans concerned that greater dependence on private money inevitably means conservative programming should also be reassured to see that the San Francisco Symphony has one of the most audacious repertoires in the United States
If the public has progressive tastes private money and innovative programming are entirely compatible
The corollary is that public money makes possible an adventurous programming even if the public s taste has a tendency to be conservative
This is one reason why artists in Europe like public money it frees them from a repertoire of only Beethoven and Mozart
In addition the public can come to appreciate a daring plan if someone proposes it to them
Of course if the public founds are reduced regarding showbusiness not only these one will have to depend more of private founds but the price of tickets will have to increase
Some complain and prefer the system of queuing for tickets because they fear that higher prices will compromise future audiences by excluding youth
But low prices for the performing arts do not solve the thorny issue of young people s access
First young people may not take advantage of cheap seats simply because whatever the cost classical music does not interest them
Then even if they want to go there it is sometimes impossible for them to get tickets which are often no longer available because the subscriptions stay in the same hands year after year
What is the interest of low prices which serve mainly to subsidise the same subscriptions holders if there is no room
If the taste for classical music has to be subsidized one must favor better targeted grants rather than low prices
The best way to attract youth to the performing arts is to go through education
Given that American orchestras can t count on schools or the government to provide the basic music education to ensure an ongoing audience for classical music some orchestras are doing it themselves with private money
In San Francisco for example the Symphony is running a project called Keeping Score financed with private funds of up to 23 million which includes a national TV series radio broadcasts an interactive music apprenticeship and school music programs
This type of innovative program applies as much to European orchestras as to American
The problem of youth and its access to the performing arts exists on both sides of the Atlantic
Just like the poor quality of music education in the public schools
If the orchestras don t take care of their own future they may simply not to have one
Respect for the law Russian style
Throughout the world we are concerned with the disappearances of political freedoms in Vladimir Putin s Russia
The Russians themselves are practically the only ones not to worry about this creeping authoritarianism
They seem less concerned about political freedoms that with social protection pensions family violence children s rights or police brutality
In fact most Russians are indifferent to the government s efforts to restrict freedom of press and the right to protest
This apathy makes my job as a mediator a position established in the Duma parliament to protect political rights in Russia difficult if not impossible
The ombudsman serves as a bridge between authorities and the people he tries to resolve conflicts between state organs and ctizens
My office is open not only to Russian citizens but also to foreign nationals and stateless people who believe that their political rights have been threatened
We apply the Russian constitution but also the principles of international law and standards on human rights sometimes even in contradiction to our Constitution
For example as a mediator I am opposed to the restriction of the right of the Russians to be jurors
Those who wanted to limit the use of panels supposedly feared for national security
My office worked closely with the state to ensure that most of the trials proceed with jury
Similarly my office has defended the weekly liberal Novoe Vremya subject to pressure by the City of Moscow on the pretext of trade litigation concerning a lease
The dispute is not resolved but following my speech the Moscow authorities were forced to take account of the negative public attitude to their attempts to censor the newspaper
Of course Russia provides examples of problems relating to the fundamental political freedoms and much more in the headlines as the dirty war in Chechnya or the Yukos affair
My office concerns itself with Chechnya as much as possible although this is not easy from Moscow
I could spend all my time there but Russia has 89 regions and innumerable human rights problems to solve
This is why I suggested to Mr Putin that Chechnya be given its own regional mediator permanently
The new Chechen authorities appear to be delighted
With respect to the Yukos affair my office cannot intervene in any ongoing legal proceedings
The lawyers for the former Director General of Yukos Mikhail Khodorkovsky filed a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg
If Khodorkovsky contests the final decision of the Russian courts he will no doubt appeal before this juisdiction
Only then will I be able to give my opinion
Many observers insist however that people who are the subject of a criminal investigation should be released on bail and not in jail
For others this is not possible in Khodorkovsky s case He is very wealthy and could easily escape justice and flee abroad
That s precisely what s the other people accused in the Yukos affair did
All these serious problems in the area of human rights highlight the incompleteness of Russian legal institutions
For example the Duma has put in much too much time passing a law concerning pressure groups which in most advanced democracies clearly defines acceptable and unacceptable behavior
Khodorkovsky perhaps would not have so much trouble if such laws existed
But the lack of legislation is directly linked to the absence of clear ideas
Human rights in Russia are often trampled simply because the people do not know they have those rights
The most important objective for my office is that everyone learns to better defend their rights and that the authorities take in account complaints of ordinary russian citizens
Unfortunately most of bureaucrats still despise the values of Human Rights
But the real difficulty for my office is not ignorance nor legal loopholes it is the fact that in a legal system inadequately developed as the one of Russia my authority is essentially personal and requires the support of the media
The notions of human rights are still rudimentary and can be expected as an awareness that spreads gradually
My strategic objective is thus to make better known the mediator s office in order to get more respect and recognition from the citizens and the state
It is almost impossible without co operation with non governmental human rights organizations in Russia
I also consider that one of my tasks is to encourage contacts between these groups and the authorities
The government s response to these initiatives will help to better know whether and to what extent the Putin government intends to include the political and human rights in the framework of its dictatorship of law
The revolutionary conservative pope
Twenty five years ago the Polish people were surprised that one of them Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Krakow had been appointed to the papacy
Some were frightened others have shed tears of joy
Here s as a famous writer wrote the second Baptism of Poland
But even in our euphoria we did not expect the new pope to change not only Poland but the entire world
His first visit to his native country shortly after his induction showed the world the power of the new pope
The communist police has disappeared from the main streets in Warsaw the streets have become models of order
After decades of being deprived of their independence the Poles have suddenly regained their capacity for self determination
By saying out loud that there can be no Europe without an independent Poland on its map the pope has managed to sweep away the unfair post war colonisation which had subjected Poland to Soviet power
Then at Auschwitz the Pope said I speak on behalf of all those whose rights are unknown and trampled in the world I speak because I am involved we are all linked by the truth
At this point in this Golgotha of modern times he called the Poles who remembered their families gassed in the Auschwitz crematories and those who froze in the concentration camps in Siberia in a brotherhood devoted to combating even justified hatred and revenge
Some see the Pope as the man who has led a religious revival others take him for a man of peace
Some see him as a defender of the poor others a criticism of the theology of liberation
For the people of Poland John Paul II by making the human rights the focal point of his teaching will be forever the man who gave us the courage and hope who has restored our historical identity
Indeed during the first decade of his reign the Pope gave all his efforts to the fight against the dictatorship and particularly the communist dictatorship
The strategy made by the Pope for the Catholic Church and its ability to mobilize millions of believers to its cause have meant that no one can never repeat the question posed by Stalin How many divisions the Pope has
John Paul II demonstrated that moral strength was a weapon powerful enough to undo the division of the world established at Yalta
Perhaps in part because of their staunchly anti communist position the Catholic Church and John Paul II often receive the label of conservatives
This accusation suggests that the Church cannot cohabitate easily with a pluralist democracy
In the fight against communism the Polish church has certainly been rather conservative thank God
It has shown conservative in its absolute loyalty to the evangelical values to the truth of faith and to its historical identity
For a system which officially advocated atheism and legalized lying the church has embodied a living reproach
However with the disappearance of communism the problem encountered by John Paul II and his church at the moment is this in what language can evangelical values be expressed in a world in which evil is not represented by a political system but is present in each soul
What is the message of the Pope for the post communist world he helped to create
John Paul II undoubtedly keep his distance with the liberal economic ideas wich he often treat as permissive and morally relative
The Pope s statements on behalf of collective values are often marked by criticism of individualism
He considers the shortcomings of liberalism as being particularly pernicious in the post communist countries
The market economy despite its practical success often seems in his eyes lacking of a heart and a human face
He believes that the market promotes entrepreneurship at the expense of human solidarity
John Paul II is not highly enthusiastic about modern western civilization with its separation from the world of values and he contrasts it with those societies which have just emerged from several decades of dictatorship
As Alexander Solzhenitsyn the pope has a tendency to believe that this is primarily in the resistance to totalitarianism that man can become truly free and safeguard the fundamental values of civilisation
I confess that I consider the legacy of Communism with more skepticism
Totalitarian pressure has in fact created exceptional men such as John Paul II and Alexander Solzhenitsyn people who consider that religious faith has bought freedom from lies and solitude
But it has also created men such as Andrei Sakharov and Vaclav Havel who have defended their supreme values by referring to a secular humanism and speaking in its name
However for most people life under a totalitarian dictatorship was certainly nothing ennobling rather it acted as a daily immersion into lies spiritual depravity and material corruption
This is why the post communist companies do not demonstrate nobility or show any disinterestedness that is notably different from the west
The defeat of communism has left a large black hole in the souls of communities a hole that is now filled by ideas of nationalism intolerance and Western consumerism
But the first hunch of John Paul II is correct the post communist world the eastern and western is a spiritual crisis and the Pope wishes to undermine it by leading it to realize the importance of values higher
Indeed by his words and the example he gives the Pope disrupts the world it wants to live in wealth and comfort and the Pope reminds us that we also need to live with dignity
No single label can apply to John Paul II who is often a mixture of contradictory characteristics rejection of compromise ecumenism tenacity enthusiasm intellectual openness insistence on theological orthodoxy
This is a conservative lovers of freedom and a supporter of peace which condemns the injustice but that reminds us that Mercy is more important than justice
It is in that matter that he embodies the paradox which Christianity represents the sacred and sustainable principles associated with the understanding and tolerance
Twenty five years after the departure of John Paul II in Rome we the Polish remain grateful for getting us to regain our freedom
It is a good thing that John Paul II be with us
A world in which everything changes needs a watchdog to look after what does not change
The interventionist syndrome
Kosovo is often used as a test case for the concept of humanitarian intervention
But while Iraq enters into the spiral of chaos diplomats and national leaders are wondering again if it is appropriate for the alliances of nations or the international community to intervene when a sovereign country seems unable or unwilling to defend its citizens against genocide war crimes or ethnic cleansing
At the center of this debate is the so called doctrine of responsibility to protect
As a mediator in Kosovo appointed by the United Nations over five years I have had the unique opportunity to observe the effects of this doctrine after NATO intervention in the former Yugoslavia in 1999
Kosovo has thus become an international example of society building conducted by the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo UNMIK
Experience is the right word here
Indeed Kosovo has turned into a tube test of the international intervention
I have lived and worked long enough in Kosovo to see the result and I claim that such experiments require more thorough research
It seems clear that the need for an international intervention in a crisis situation depends on each specific period and a rapid response is often necessary
However setting aside military factors where such interventions are considered it is vitally important to concentrate the international policy discussions on the rapid deployment of a civilian presence and on security ties between one another
It is even more true when the human suffering is caused by the conflict of communities as was the case in Kosovo
The immediate deployment of a civilian presence and adequate security immediately after the end of the NATO bombing of 1999 could have provided appropriate means to protect against the backlash that allowed the victims to become executioners
The peacekeeping forces of NATO were not tasked with preventing abductions and disappearances revenge killings and the massive destruction of property by ethnic Albanians which resulted in a large reverse ethnic cleansing of the non Albanian predominantly Serbian population
A consequence of this neglect a residue of social and political venom pervades Kosovo
Instead of calming the community conflicts inter ethnic hatred is fiercer than ever
Besides the lack of civilian and security presence to reassure each community the general lack of legal mechanism to quickly render justice for crimes committed during and after the intervention has created further tension
This tension is so pervasive in fact that any hopes of wrapping up the necessary reconciliation process must now be delayed to the distant future
Similarly in Kosovo the international community has devoted little time to helping the former combatants onsider their collective responsibility for the atrocities whethertheir personal involvement was directly or indirect
Without such an effort trying to improve the situation is tantamount to build a house on a pile of sand
This lack of foresight and of projects in the aftermath of armed intervention is not only dangerous for the people officially saved it is also counterproductive
When a humanitarian intervention is not structured to guarantee basic security the underlying antagonism that inspired the intervention is at its core only strengthened not diminished
Six years after NATO intervention Kosovo is farther than ever from stability and social peace
Despite repeated assurances from the UN authorities that Kosovo is on the path of reconciliation and genuine autonomy the NATO representatives indicate that there are plans to maintain a long term military presence in the province to ensure that the political process will be put in place with success
This leads me to another key point a possible exit strategy is as important to the success of any humanitarian intervention in the future that the entry strategy
For international intervention to have a real chance of success it is advisable from the beginning to define the criteria of success
One such clarity can properly be an end to the commitment of international players
In Kosovo such clarity is and has been lacking as a result NATO and the UN have no clear idea about the time or the means by which they must both withdraw
One day someone quite rightly said that it is easy to bomb but much more difficult to rebuild it is relatively easy to dissolve a military regime but it is much more difficult to build a robust civil and durable society in its place
The United Nations General Assembly should keep this idea in mind when it begins to codify the doctrine of responsibility to protect
The divisions of the right in Central Europe
Will Eastern Europe reach a certain political stability
Since 1989 the election results did not stop oscillating between right and left
Vicktor Orban the young and bright Hungarian prime minister will he put an end to this situation
Thanks to a brutal program designed to absorb its political rivals on the right Fidesz the Hungarian Civic Union party has come to have almost as many members as the Socialist Party on its left
He also benefited from the internal conflicts in the Socialist Party which have harmed one of its main assets his strict discipline and professionalism inherited from communism
Vicktor Orban s efforts to gather the divided right under the banner of FIDESZ have been partial successful and are unique in Eastern Europe
Since the collapse of communism in the Czech Republic in Hungary Poland and in Slovakia the moderate right wing parties are fragmented and lack a genuine political perspective
Although these countries have not yet fully recovered from several decades of communist management the divisions within the right have facilitated the election victory for the left sometimes represented by former communists
The right wing forces in central Europe have to confront problems similar to those faced by right wing parties elsewhere in Europe where Social Democrats salvaging liberal ideas manage to succeed in occupying all alone the center of the political chessboard
In central Europe this phenomenon was amplified by the fact that the ruling parties of all political persuasions had to privatize the economy and introduce under pressure from the European Union reforms which in the West would have been put in place by the right
In several Central European countries the left have been better positioned to accomplish these reforms than the right because paradoxically they have a greater legitimacy for that
Many people believe that the socialists get involved in privatisation or attack social protection unless it is absolutely necessity
In Central Europe the fundamental problem of the right is its lack of a clearly defined identity
Although politicians of the moderate right wing formally claim traditional ideologies liberalism or conservatism for example their electorate little accustomed to Western political concepts does not always understand the significance of these terms
Numerous polls show that a significant part of the electorate of various countries in central Europe align themselves to the right but decades of paternalistic communism have moved the center of gravity in the region far to the left
Thus a person can simultaneously declare herself liberal and ask that the government continue to subsidize the energy education and housing
Under the communist regimes the ideology was just a vulgar instrument at the power service
As this time even today many people accept formally ideological labels but does not want insofar as they can remove a tangible benefit in the short term
This cynicism about ideologies leads to the electorate s abrupt changes of heart
The problem of identity is further exacerbated by the upsurge of nationalism Most of the central European countries in which the building of a national identity was delayed by communism succumb to nationalist sentiments that can be manipulated by politicians
Although some of them say they are right wing the image of Vladimir Meciar the former Slovak Prime Minister are in fact populist and authoritarian demagogues
The current situation of the right in the countries of central Europe is also explained by their history and tradition
The political evolution in Czechoslovakia during the last 20 years of Communism has alienated the Czech Republic and Slovakia from Poland and Hungary
While Poland and Hungary knew under communism an internal liberalization which has allowed a part of the activity to escape semi officially to communist control Czechoslovakia knew a strict neo Stalinist regime after the Soviet invasion of 1968
In 1989 when the communist regime collapsed the Communist parties in Poland and Hungary have turned into left wing parties democratic and credible They were able to effectively oppose the right wing parties that were created
But in Czechoslovakia the rigid communist party has not been able to give birth to a Democratic Party anchored to the left
Faced with this gap the moderate right wing had a free hand and was able to retain a certain unity until 1997
But the lack of a strong opposition led to the collapse of the right which had become divided and lost a common language
In Slovakia country where the nationalist sentiments have played an important role after 1989 the political forces do not split for the moment on a left right axis
The main political battles are taking place between the essentially antidemocratic nationalist and populist forces on one side and the forces fighting for democracy on the other
The threat of Meciar s return to power led all the Democrats from both right and left to stand up together
Even in these circumstances the right remains divided thereby allowing a possible return to power by Meciar
In Hungary the right has been a victim of the opposition between the conservatives and the populists on one side and the liberals from mainly urban classes on the other
The right wing parties have not come to an agreement as to whether they need to align with the traditional ideologies inspired by the West or with a form of conservative nationalism like that of Hungary
Although the current ruling coalition made up of conservatives and populists has achieved some successes the moment of truth for the right has not yet arrived
The Polish right wing represents the hardest case
Its problems date back to the communist era when the Solidarity trade union became the main movement of opposition against the communists during the time that unions are generally left
Since the fall of communism various groups of Solidarity have wanted to embody the right sowing confusion in the political discourse
The Christian Democrat parties linked to the church and the liberal parties have been to some extent marginalized
The situation is made more complex by the need to include the populist and nationalist parties They are relatively strong because they can rely on the farming community which is an important electoral base in Poland
As in other post communist countries it is essentially the democratic forces of the left who have benefited from divisions of the right
Fed up with WalMart
Do you want to know what video clip will soon be making policymakers throughout the world tremble
The economist Thomas Holmes following a scenario that looks like a disturbing way the spread of a global epidemic has prepared a dynamic map simulation showing the expansion of the United States Wal Mart stores
Starting with the epicentre in Bentonville in Arkansas where Sam Walton opened his first store in 1962 huge Wal Mart big box stores magasins boîtes have now multiplied to the point that the average American lives less than seven kilometers from one of these retailers
It is interesting to note that the shops are changing like the petals of a flower ever thickening and expanding
Rather than jumping directly to the coasts since 80 of Americans live within a radius of 80 km from the Atlantic or the Pacific Wal Mart has spread in a more organic and indirect way with a chain of suppliers that is constantly expanding
Even if every new shop steals some of the clientele of Wal Mart stores in the vicinity the effectiveness of supply steadily improving helps maintain the overall growth of the chain
Love it or hate it Wal Mart is undeniably the perfect example of the costs and benefits of modern globalization
Consumers spend considerably less there than in traditional stores
For example economists believe that groceries at Wal Mart are 25 cheaper than in any other supermarket chain
The difference in price for many other consumer products is even greater
Consider this astonishing fact along with some other stores of the same sort like Target Best Buy and Home Depot Wal Mart accounts for about 50 of the vaunted increase in productivity in the U S as compared to Europe over the course of the past ten years
Fifty percent
And the same kind of progress among the chains of Wholesalers account for 25 more
The idea that Americans have become better in all things while the other rich countries stagnated is very wrong
The miracle of US productivity and the emergence of trade in the style of Wal Mart are practically synonymous
I have nothing against these big hypermarkets
They are a godsend for low income consumers and offset in part the tepid growth in wages from which many of them have suffered over the course of the past two decades
And I disagree with some of my friends who snub the Wal Mart stores and claim there have never set foot
As a consumer I love the big box stores
It is also certainly the case of America s trading partners Wal Mart alone accounts for more than 10 of all American imports from China
But I nevertheless have some reservations about the Wal Mart model being used as a blueprint of global growth
First there is the question of its effect on the workers on low wages and on the smaller retailers
The investigations reveal that while remaining within the law its social policies exploit the gaps in regulation which for example allow it to escape the burden of healthcare costs for many employees Wal Mart provides health coverage to less than half of its employees
And the arrival of these hypers in a community crushes long established retailers and often transforms the community s personality is a startling way
Yes up to a certain point it is the price to pay for progress
But the loss of aesthetics and community is not simply calculated based on statistics on income and prices
The big box stores are not really cute hence the name big boxes
If their explosive growth continues over the next 20 years will Americans one day consider their proliferation a spectacular example of the failure of growth models which are weighted toward the regional level
Indeed many Europeans and others would consider the video simulation of Holmes replicating the development of Wal Mart as a horror film
The French may have invented the hypermarket ancestor of the big box store but they never intended to allow it to develop unrestricted
The big question for Europeans is whether they can find ways to use some of the efficiency gains encapsulated by the Wal Mart model without being overtaken by it
For Americans there is also the question of knowing what to do when the big box stores phenomenon will slow down
If a large part of US productivity is truly reduced to nothing more than letting Wal Mart and its supermarket cousins continue their insane expansion what happens when this source of growth is exhausted
The US economy has many other forces including its financial system and its dominant position in terms of capital goods but the fact is that the advantage of the United States in this sector has not yet been as striking as the Wal Mart phenomenon
It is curious to see how many people seem to think that the US will grow faster than Europe and Japan over the next ten years simply because it happened during the last ten years
Wal Mart and its ilk are a central element of our modern era of globalization
They are not really the epidemic that their explosive growth pattern resembles but their emergence is not completely benign
Those who wish to emulate the trends in US productivity must ask themselves today what they would think of the emergence of stores in the shape of boxes dotting their countryside pulling wages down and causing the death of small retail businesses
The Americans meanwhile must think where is the balance between aesthetics community and low prices
Accept the science
The economic progress in the long term is mainly allowed by the invention and the spread of improved technologies
The scientific revolution has been made possible by the press prints the industrial revolution in the steam engine and if India from the famine it is thanks to higher yields the so called green revolution
The era of globalization that we live emerged with the spread of computers and Internet
In this way when we look for solutions to some of the most difficult world problems we can also find them at least in part in new technologies likely to resolve old seemingly insolvable problems
Take the example of poverty in Africa
All the possible explanations were made and usually the finger focus on what Africans did wrong
But a visit to African villages makes it clear that the problem is more conditioned by the fight for survival in poor physical conditions than by any other problem inherent to African societies
The African farmers produce about one third or less of food less per hectare than other farmers of the world which led to a large scale famine exacerbated by the heavy burden of disease
Malaria is a unique challenge of its kind mainly due to the species of mosquitoes in Africa which are particularly suited to transmitting the disease
Other tropical parasitic diseases are also heavy curses on the continent
Add to that the practical difficulty represented by the roads in poor condition and the scarcity of cars and trucks and the economic isolation follows
The challenges of survival are thus enormous
Practical solutions are available however because simple and inexpensive technologies can solve some specific problems
We can overcome the low crop yields with improved seed varieties specially adapted to African conditions combined with technologies to enrich the soil and water management
Malaria can be controlled through new long life mosquito nets and a new generation of effective medicines
Other tropical diseases can also be controlled and practical technologies to get drinking water can reduce substantially diarrheal diseases
Mobile phones wireless local Internet and more roads could contribute greatly to breaking the economic isolation of African villages
The donor countries are always asking the Africans to change their trade policies their government institutions their administrations and more
Some of these changes are important but the rich countries go sometimes beyond their role by focusing on everything except on how to finance and to introduce practical technologies to solve practical problems
The mistakes of the wealthy countries would not be significant if the African countries had enough money to acquire the necessary technologies by themselves but Africa is so poor that it needs financial assistance in order to escape from poverty
The challenges of development in Africa are just one example of how difficult social problems can be solved thanks to the design and the spread of improved technologies
The same will be a correct way to best solve the problem of climate change caused by man one of these global problems is seemingly unsolvable
For now rich countries change the global climate by emitting millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide each year by the use of coal oil and natural gas
In the coming years China and India will also significatly contribute to increase the amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
And yet no country it is rich or poor is keen to reduce energy consumption concerned that such a move could threaten its jobs its income and its economic growth
The new technologies will provide a very important part of the solution
Already hybrid automobiles which combine fuel and battery can almost double the fuel efficiency and divide by two carbon dioxide emissions
In addition engineers have developed techniques for the capture and safe underground storage of the carbon dioxide resulting from the burning of coal for power stations
This new technology can reduce by 80 carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production
The costs are relatively modest
Let us also consider the depopulation of the oceans due to overfishing
The global demand for fish is increasing as well as the world s capacity for fishing which threatens certain species with extinction
An improved aquaculture where fish are raised in containers and fish tanks is still far from being a perfect technology particularly for environmental reasons and yet it is very promising
During a recent visit to Africa a prominent agronomist stated that in today s world the scientist is closer than ever to the farmer but farther than ever from the legislator
Politicians do not understand science and rarely seek the opinion of scientists and engineers when they want to solve big problems
Everything is viewed in terms of politics and elections and nothing is considered a technical problem requiring technological expertise which is why African poverty is so often attributed to corruption rather than to environmental challenges
It is easy to dismiss the suggestion that technology can be the solution
After all technological progress also requires good governance market forces effective universities and more
Politics also has a role to play
Anyway it is time to recognize that governments are poorly equipped to understand sophisticated technological challenges and opportunities the world could benefit from and that new systems are needed to ensure science and technology are accorded the necessary authority to tackle a broad range of global problems which are becoming more and more urgent
It is time today that all the major international agencies and governments take responsibility to use the scientific expertise and technology they will need in the 21st century
Unblocking the Situation in Latin America
One of the biggest headaches of the world economy is undoubtedly the poor performance of Latin America
Since the early 1980s Latin America has found itself blocked with per capita income when there was any growing slowly in most of the region and with one major crisis after another
Many policies have been attempted particularly the liberalization of trade the privatisation of inefficient state owned companies and fiscal reforms
However something prevents Latin America to move forward
The lack of robust growth is even more disconcerting in light of the many benefits and social achievements of Latin America
The natural resources are abundant and the fertile earths abound
The health conditions are fairly acceptable and all Latin American countries have made progress against illiteracy the majority reaching at least 90 of adult literacy
In addition the fertility rates have fallen sharply to reach a rate where the populations of many countries will stabilise probably for the next decades
The condition of women has improved and the girls are granted equal access to education with tuition rates higher than boys in many countries
Latin America is undoubtedly known for its macho culture but the rate of women in the working population continues to grow and they are occupying more and more high profile social and political positions
Latin America is glorified by other advantages over the long term
Most of its citizens live on the coasts and enjoy privileged access to international trade and others live in cities another advantage for growth
Indeed the region is not poor according to international standards but rather mired in the area of average earnings between the world s poorest countries and the high income countries of North America Europe and Eastern Asia
Why then the surprising lack of real growth in the past 25 years
I reject the responsibility on two unsolved but soluble problems
The first has existed for centuries social divisions whose origins date back to the European conquest of Native Americans in the 16th Century
More than other countries Latin America was born during a violent conquest
The Europeans subjugated the Amerindian people and also brought back especially in the Caribbean basin and in Brazil massive cargoes of African slaves
Societies have become racially and ethnically complex since European Native American and African populations have practiced mixed marriage but the trend over the long term of European dominance of indigenous and African American enslavement and of strongly rooted poverty have deeply scarred societies in Latin America
Even today the income inequality of Latin America are among the world s largest reflecting the old models of ethnic and racial division
Income inequality casts a large shadow
The rich have been fighting for a long time against the taxes needed to increase investment in the areas of education and healthcare for the poor thus perpetuating profound social divisions and leaving many people without healthcare and without the skills required by global competitiveness
The situation is improving today in some countries such as Brazil which bodes well for the future
In other countries such as Guatemala and parts of the Andean region the social divisions are marred by violence and mistrust
In addition to this problem a fundamental failure of the economic strategy has been largely ignored a failure that is reflected in the major difference between the discussions on public policy in Latin America and Asia
In Asia the public debate is about the technology how can Asia can catch up
The Asian governments act with determination to increase the scientific and technological capacities of their economies
In Latin America the world technological revolution is much less discussed and the national policies to promote science and technology reach rarely the forefront
Resulting in Latin America not taking proper advantage of the world technological revolution
The developing Asian countries now produce computers semiconductors pharmaceutical products and software
By contrast even the star seller in Latin America Chile remains largely an export economy based on resources heavily focused on exports of copper and agricultural products
These sectors are technologically sophisticated but form a narrow base for long term development
The situation is far from hopeless
Brazil has shown predispositions to be a technological goods exporting power
It has succeeded obviously to export aircrafts and many consumer goods
Mexico has also started to mobilize a considerable amount of technological know how
Argentina Chile and other countries could become noteworthy agricultural producers in the vanguard of the agro biotechnology for example if they bothered
However Latin American countries have not yet tried to trigger a technological revolution certainly not with the level of importance competence commitment and financing of the Asian countries
Such an upsurge could play a major role in the take off of economic growth
Such a policy would commit to significantly increase spending on research and development as the developing Asian countries have done
The Latin American countries must increase spending to reach up to 2 of GDP currently 0 5 in part through public support for laboratories and universities and in part by benefits for research and development of the private sector They must unroll the red carpet for high tech multinational companies as Asia did
They also need to focus more on training in science and technology and encourage a greater proportion of students to receive a university education
The government stipends for tuition and for new universities and bigger universities can play an expanded role as can investment in computers and information technology in schools and communities
The social and technological program will depend on each another
Both of them are asking Latin American companies to invest more in the people who are affected by these programs so that the Latin Americans can position themselves at the forefront with respect to global productivity
If these investments touch every country in Latin America both rich and poor the prospects of the region will improve considerably
The price of real estate a house of cards
The first important city to see a boom was London around 1996
This attitude spread to Los Angeles New York and Sydney around 1997 and Paris in 1998 all the way to Miami Moscow and Shanghai in 2001 and Vancouver in 2002
These cities and others have seen house prices inflate since then Prices have risen to at least 50 in fixed prices since 2000
This was the source of major unexpected profits for owners but also the source of a problem for anyone preparing to buy a property
Today the rise of home prices subsides in some of these big cities
The growth rate in London and New York slowed down dramatically during the course of the last year and it fell to about a 1 real increase since the second quarter of 2004
In Sydney the prices of homes actually fell during the second quarter
Is it the end of the boom
No other city would benefit from it
Worse still could the mood of real estate markets lead to a drop in prices
No one had foreseen this boom so to predict its end is risky
Housing prices have shown a strong upward movement against the post holiday warnings
Any prediction about the end of the boom requires an understanding of the reasons for its development in so many different cities
Curiously there is no generally accepted explanation because the ultimate causes of the boom are primarily psychological
Economists prefer to discuss interest rates or unemployment statistics concrete and knowable factors
Of course these indicators have a legitimate role to play in explaining the property markets but they are simply not sufficient to explain the recent boom
Three psychological causes emerge from all of that first a change to the public perception about the sources of value in a changing global economy and growing confidence the public has in the cities glamour whose name is known internationally and finally the simple dynamic of exciting speculative bubbles
Each factor deserves more attention if you want to understand the present market conditions and see the future price trends
First the world economy seems more chaotic than it was ten years ago
Plummeting share prices in most countries since 2000 offer little reassurance as to most financial assets encouraging the move to safe haven investments real estate in this case
Moreover terrorism is now seen as a problem for everyone Indonesia Spain and Russia have suffered their own tragedies
We are reassured by investing in real estate and there is little reason to expect an imminent change
Fear and soaring real estate prices are encouraging each other
Then public confidence in the cities international glamor is growing thanks to the explosive growth of global communications through the Internet and mobile phone
Just as we admire international celebrities we recognize famous international centers of business technology and culture whose names are familiar to everybody possessing universally a unique value
As for fear of terrorism and the lack of confidence in the stock markets the geographical celebrity seems elastic not to say self enforced the more New York Paris and London are famous the more they are attractive
Finally the contagious speculation behind any bubble cannot be ignored
The current boom has seen the contagion spread within markets and across markets with rising prices fueling popular excitement and thus further fueling the rise itself in the same city and then in other cities until it reaches the other side of the globe
Residents of Shanghai may not discuss real estate prices in London but the leaders of public opinion in Shanghai know what is going on in London and any boom in that city makes the possibility of a boom in Shanghai plausible
In contrast to the two other psychological reasons speculative contagion has a natural end
A speculative bubble which sustains itself solely on the reaction to rising prices cannot continue indefinitely
So where will it take us
Two of the psychological causes suggest a continuing increase in house prices while the third suggests the end of this rising movement one of these days without saying when
I ll bet that some highly attractive cities will continue to experience a slowing of growth in housing prices then eventually a decline
Historically housing prices have always demonstrated strong movements and prices in all of these cities are still going up at a significant rate even if it is generally a bit slower than a year or two ago
If we extrapolate the trends of growth it seems reasonable to forecast that prices will continue to grow significantly in most of these cities for a year or two even if the rate of growth continues to decline
The psychological factors are more important for the long term prognosis beyond a year when the upward movement no longer plays such an important role
At this stage prices are likely to show unstable drop because enthusiasm for investing in stone will probably collapse at the same time as the decline in price growth
The prices in glamorous cities will fall significantly in the next recession or when the economy will suffer it s next major impact or if interest rates rise too quickly
Then the contagion within and across the markets will fall making prices faill for years
Water for all
This month once more water takes centre stage at the fourth World Water Forum in Mexico
This is an opportune moment While the attention of most of the world is focused on energy issues supply and security hundreds of millions of people in developing countries still see the supply of fresh water as equally important if not more
The investigations conducted by the World Bank in developing countries show that when you ask poor people to name the three most important challenges they face good health is always part of this list
And the key factor that determines whether they will remain healthy is the access to clean water
Today in the world over a billion people do not have access
So they are always easier prey to ill health
The World Bank estimates that by 2035 nearly three billion people almost all in developing countries could live in conditions of very serious water shortages especially if they live in Africa the Middle East or South Asia
This will cause obvious difficulties but will also hinder the economic growth needed for millions of people to escape poverty
In Latin America nearly 15 of the population so nearly 76 million people has no access to drinking water and 116 million people don t have access to health service
The numbers are worse for Africa and certain parts of Asia
This is a situation that few people have to face in rich countries
Normally the citizens of these countries benefit from public services that meet all their water needs from drinking to irrigation and sanitation needs
In addition other issues related to water such as the risks posed by floods have been reduced to manageable levels
The rich industrial countries invested very early and very heavily in infrastructure institutions and water management
The results beyond the health benefits that it provides to all have provided evidence of record economic growth it is enough to examine the hydro electric investments to understand the positive impact of projects for the management of water in many countries
Of course rich countries have some advantages they enjoy generally temperate climates where the rains are regular and have usually little risk of drought or flood
Even so they are not immune to water related disasters as the destruction of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina has shown us
But the impact of such events on poor countries is far more important
The extreme variations of the rains floods and droughts can have social and economic impact and result in loss of life on a large scale
The coasts of the Gulf of Mexico and the Central American countries are constantly experiencing such tragedies with the deprived communities being the most vulnerable and the least able to deal with these events
The Ethiopia and Yemen are two comparable outstanding examples
The development potential of the Ethiopia is so intimately linked to seasonal rains that huge variations in the rain and the lack of infrastructure has undermined the growth and perpetuated poverty
A simple drought can reduce the potential for growth by 10 in the long term
Yemen meanwhile has no permanent surface water and its citizens are entirely reliant on rainfall groundwater and floods
To move forward developing countries need new infrastructures and better management of water
All approaches must be designed in conjunction with the specific context of each country and the needs of their respective people but there is no constraint linked with the investment in the use of water that ensures that local communities and the environment can obtain tangible benefits quickly
In some countries the implementation of new water infrastructures usually means the creation of canals pumping stations and dams
Other countries may need deeper reservoirs more modern sewage treatment plants or improved water transportation systems
All of that may be designed to improve and extend the water supply for energy generation irrigation and industrial and private use while at the same time ensuring some degree of security against droughts and some protection against floods
The key to the success of any expansion of investment in water infrastructure is to proportionally increase investment in the institutions managing water
If the infrastructure is poorly managed it does not help to improve the health of populations or to support economic growth the organisation of water and water management must work together
The infrastructure can and should be developed in parallel with good well managed institutions related to the environment and with an equitable balance of costs and benefits
A policy of investment in water that reduces the vulnerability of the poor and provides access to water for all requires a personalized management and a special partnership between the donor countries developing country governments the private sector and local communities
Delegates of the World Water Forum will have multiple opportunities to build and strengthen these partnerships
If successful the benefits that poor people worldwide will draw will be immense
Germany in a state of economic shock
Over the past ten years Germany has experienced the slowest economic growth of the European Union and Europe the slowest growth in the world
From 1995 to 2005 German growth will not exceed 14 6 whereas the old EU average was 24 39 9 in the United States and the global economy was 45 6
What can explain such bad results in Germany
According to Franz Müntefering Chairman of the Social Democratic Party the ruling party of Germany it is simply because the country is already where others wish to be
The slow growth in Germany he maintained is a sign of natural convergence
This theory is far from convincing
Germany has recently been surpassed in terms of per capita income by many EU countries including Ireland the United Kingdom Holland and France and its growth remains slower than theirs
Another theory more plausible is that over the last 15 years several external challenges or shocks have simultaneously rocked the country
Trapped by its rigidity its social system extended and a labour market highly regulated Germany has been unable to react to these shocks and began to encounter problems
This theory calls to mind a theory of the British historian Arnold Toynbee which says that empires crumble because they are unable to respond to external challenges
The first shock was the intensification of globalization which provoked a massive surge of competition based on low wages
Even if globalization is a progressive process it gained energy when China has decided to enter the game
China is ten times the size of Japan and Japan had not been very easy to manage
German precision instruments and optical equipment for example lost their competitiveness when Japan took the stage
The second shock has been one of European integration especially the expansion in the north and south
The dismantling of the internal borders of the EU has all of a sudden extended the size of national markets and resulted in the planned economies of scale
But this phenomenon has favoured small European countries more then large ones and has meant more competition for Germany the largest economy in Europe
Take Nokia the mobile phone manufacturer
Thanks to the economies of scale made possible by the common market Nokia has been able to fully exploit their inventions while Germany s Siemens had recently decided to drop the mobile phone market
The third shock has been the euro European currency has provoked a rapid convergence of long term interest rates which in certain countries have reached up to 5 to 7 percentage points more than in Germany
Freed from exchange rate risks international investors do not ask these countries for more risk premium and are happy to provide funds on favorable terms to all of them which was formerly Germany s prerogative
Europe only benefits from the situation as the capital is now better distributed and growth stimulated with the migration of the German economy to the remote locations which were previously disadvantaged in the euro zone
However the benefit is doubtful for German workers who have also wanted to take advantage of this capital
The fourth shock took the form of the enlargement to the east of the EU which led to extraordinary opportunities for trade and investment but also to a surge of low priced labor
In average the wage levels in the 10 countries that joined the EU in 2004 represent only 14 of West Germany s
The low wage competition has led to substantial outsourcing and offshore activities that have allowed German companies to remain competitive by reducing their demand for domestic labor
Since neither the trade unions nor the German social system could accept pay cuts the consequences have been rising unemployment and slow growth
The fifth shock is the unification of Germany a failure in economic terms
The GDP per person of working age in eastern Germany was 61 of the level of West Germany in 1996 but it is waning today to 59
The slow growth of the eastern part of the country has brought down the German average while the huge demand for public funds is only deepening the public debt
The weakness of the fiscal position has in turn undermined investor confidence with obvious impact on economic growth
These five shocks are historic developments beneficial for the whole world but problematic for Germany
If the country wants to face challenges and continue to grow it needs to relax its labour market
Only if wages adjust downward to accommodate the new global environment that German workers will be competitive again and the country will know a low unemployment rate again by exploiting its human capital until capacity constraint
The new government that voters will likely choose in September will be facing the difficult task of getting Germans to face reality and introducing necessary reforms
Only then we will know if Germany is able to confront the Toynbee challenge that awaits it
The lessons of the tsunami
Many lessons emerge from the tsunami the cause of so much devastation and loss of human life in Asia
This is a proof of globalization while television showed the striking images of the destruction of homes in the whole world
Indeed it is in these times that the world really does seem to be a global village
Of course it seems that information on the scale of the disaster put more time to reach President Bush s ranch in Crawford Texas
But finally he decided to interrupt his vacation to offer some aid the amount of which has been constantly revised upwards in an international competition which seemed likely to profit those who were waiting desperately to be helped
American aid still appears to be shabby compared to the amount offered by countries that do have a fraction of American wealth
Australia which is sparsely populated offered more than double American aid Japan promised 50 more than America and Europe is committed to a sum five times greater
This has helped many observers point out that the richest country in the world was the poorest in terms of international aid especially when this sum is compared to what is being spent in defense and war
This disaster is international so it is also appropriate that the United Nations take the lead in coordinating the humanitarian effort
Unfortunately in an effort which was widely perceived as another attempt to undermine multilateralism the United States tried to take over the leadership of a central group assistance program ignoring ongoing efforts within the region under the aegis of the United Nations
Whatever America s motive was it judiciously decided afterwards to join the United Nations in its efforts
The rhetoric used to save the face of the Bush administration claiming that they were developing a core group in the absence of any other effort has been slowly abandoned
The response of some countries in the region was really impressive showing the battle waged in the establishment of efficient and effective governments and staff
Countless details were examined Thailand sent ambassadors in the country s affected areas to help meet the needs of citizens helped those who had lost everything passport and goods to return home cared for the injured set up systems for identifying bodies and dealt with the difficulties posed by the shortage of body bags and the lack of chilled areas to store bodies
Countries who like Thailand realised that they could cope with the financial consequences themselves have asked for humanitarian aid to be sent to other countries
They have asked for only one thing the reduction of tariffs and better access to foreign markets
They weren t asking for charity just a chance to earn their own income
They only received in response at least at the time I am writing an relentless silent
Futhermore the G7 has chosen to contribute significantly by offering to reduce the debt
This is particularly important in the case of Indonesia whose debt service now amounts to 132 billion of which 70 billion is due to public creditors or is guaranteed by government agencies
Even without the horrors of the tsunami the burden of that debt would have represented a major obstacle in the development of this country recovering as it was from the consequences of the 1997 financial crisis
Indeed the Indonesian debt relief is a convincing case as most of the debts were incurred in loans to the corrupt government of Suharto
The leaders knew or should have known that part of the total of money lent would not be attributed to the development of Indonesia
Moreover part of the debt was incurred during the crisis of 1997 98 aggravated and extended by the policies imposed by the IMF
No one pretends that it is possible to alter or prevent the forces of nature
Instead we must learn to manage them
There is now talk of improved warning systems to prevent possible tsunamis
We already have however received a warning on the issue of climate change
Most countries recognize it and went to Rio and Kyoto to act together even if it is insufficient the Kyoto Protocol was designed as a good first step
Unfortunately global warming will probably destroy the same countries that have just been ravaged by the tsunami
Islands which do not rise far above sea level such as the Maldives will be submerged
We are not a global village yet
After contesting the scientific evidence highlighting the problems the biggest polluter of the planet the United States has simply refused to act beyond mere appeal to a certain voluntary restriction that we see little achievement in America in any case
The international community must still consider the treatment to apply to this aberrant member who refuses to take his responsibilities as a global citizen
The optimists will say that technology can solve these problems
Realists will note that in the long distance race between technology and the environment it seems that as of our day technology is the loser
Nature as shown by the tsunami possesses its own clock
As long as we haven t learned to respect it we will all miss the train
The accuracy of experts
Every day experts bombard us with their views on subjects as varied as Iraqi insurgents Bolivia s coca growers central european bankers and the Politburo of North Korea
Up until what point are these experts credible
An optimistic view is that as long as those who sell expertise compete vigorously for the attention of shrewd buyers the media market mechanisms will ensure quality control
The experts published in the pages of newspapers or who appear on the television and the radio must surely have a good reputation because otherwise they would have been eliminated
Skeptics however warn that the media impose on us their choice of speakers and they are less interested in reasoned debate than in catering to popular prejudices
Accordingly celebrity may well be linked negatively and not positively to long term accuracy
Until recently nobody knew who was right because nobody kept track of the results of these experts
But a research over the last 20 years ago suggests today that sceptics are the closest to the truth
I describe this project in detail in my book Expert Political Judgment How Good Is It How Can We Know
the political judgment of experts What is it worth
How do we know The original idea was to ask for thousands of predictions from hundreds of experts about the fates of dozens of countries and note those predictions according to their accuracy
We have discovered that media does not eliminate the bad ideas but often reinforces them especially when the truth is too complex to be presented clearly
The evidence fall into two categories
First as have warned the sceptics when hordes of experts are fighting for the limelight many are tempted to claim that they know more than in reality
Experts who forecast the worst and the best are those who tend to exaggerate
Between 1985 and 2005 experts the most optimistic forecasts over 10 years ago which frontlines the chances of major changes on both the financial markets e g a Dow Jones to 36 000 and in terms of global politics for example the calm in the Middle East and dynamic growth in sub Saharan Africa
They gave a likelihood of 65 to optimistic scenarios that materialised in just 15 of cases
During the same period of time the most pessimistic experts were even more misguided exaggerating the risks of adverse changes in the very place where over optimistic experts were overfllowing whit good news and by adding many other s still I await the imminent disintegration of Canada Nigeria India Indonesia South Africa Belgium and Sudan
They gave the likelihood of 70 to disaster scenarios which were realized in only 12 of the cases
In addition as had once again been predicted the sceptics experts claim to know more than they actually pay rarely their mistakes
Indeed the media pay much attention to them while neglecting their humbler colleagues
On can see this process particularly highlighted when in following the philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin we categorize the experts as hedgehogs and foxes
The hedgehogs are those who have great ideas and become infatuated with grand theories libertarians ideas Marxism environmentalism etc
Their self confidence can be contaigeous
They know how to maintain the momentum of a discussion by increasing the number of reasons showing that they are right and that the others are wrong
This is what earns them the approval of the media
But they do not know when to press on their mental brake by making concessions to other points of view
They take their theories too seriously
Result the hedgehogs commit more mistakes but they accumulate more success on Google
The eclectic foxes are better off calming their ideological enthusiasm
They feel more comfortable in the face of prolonged uncertainty about who is right even within the framework of bitter debates admit their shortcomings and accord legitimacy to opposing points of view
They punctuate their conversations with qualifiers which limit the scope of their arguments but however and even though
As they scurry of oversimplifying foxes make fewer mistakes
To put it simply the foxes are often in agreement with the hedgehogs up to a point Yes my colleague was right when he said that the Saudi monarchy is vulnerable but remember that coups d etats are rare and the government has many ways to crush the opposition
Imagine that your job in the media depends on your ability to expand your audience
Who would you pick an expert who balances conflicting arguments and concludes that the most likely result is that nothing will change or an expert who gets the public spellbound with stories of islamic radicts taking control and provoking a rise in the prices of oil
In short the qualities that make foxes more inclined to accuracy also make them less popular
At this point uncharitable skeptics chuckle that we have the media that we deserve
But this is not fair
No society has yet created a reliable method for evaluating the results of experts
Even those citizens who value accuracy have little way of knowing they are sacrificing it when they change the channel to switch from boring foxes to charismatic hedgehogs
It is there that between stage a modest proposal which applies to all the democracies the market of ideas works better if it is easier for citizens to see the exchanges between accuracy and entertainment or between the accuracy and loyalty to a party
Don t they read more the reports of experts who have most often been right
In this case the experts could become more reliable showing more humility and the political debate begin to be less strident
Agreed it is not easy to create ways to assess who was right and that would cover the full spectrum of reasonable opinions
But in a world where as Yeats said the worst are filled with passionate intensity and the best have a lack of conviction it is worth trying
What is Europe s future
In many ways 2005 represents the annus horibilis of Europe
It started well with the approval of the proposed constitutional treaty by the Spanish voters but it turned to vinegar when the French and Dutch voters rejected it shortly after
These votes reflected in part the displeasure of voters to the domestic policies as well as their disappointment regarding the governmental conduct of European affairs
Governments are then hurriedly sent to offer more of these unsatisfactory cases
In the days after those elections they failed to agree on the European Union s budget for the period from 2007 to 2013
The French and British leaders have engaged in a dispute that has wrecked the following summit just before Britain takes the presidency in July
Generally the countries involved are using the European Union presidency to show their ability to solve problems and move the European Union forward
But since early December Britain slumbers
Besides burying the proposed constitutional treaty it largely abandoned the issue of the budget
There is very unlikely that she will succeed in getting the budget this year and unless the dispute is quickly resolved the European Union will have no operating budget for 2007
Even if the budget is finally adopted the Austrian presidency which begins on January 1st will not be lacking for depressing situations
The biggest problem remains the European inability to accelerate its growth pace and to offer jobs to its citizens
This is mainly due to the big three France Germany and Italy who produces 70 of European GDP
The collective response adopted in 2000 was the Lisbon strategy which aims to make the European Union the most dynamic economy and the most competitive in terms of knowledge in the world in 2010
More realistically it is designed to offer governments the necessary incentives to establish reforms to deal with everything that is slowing down economic growth and productivity
That means facing a myriad of interest groups from industrial lobbies to unions and entrenched bureaucracies that have so far managed to protect their area
The strategy is based on peer pressure and consists of pointing out governments who are not making progress in order to shame them
In fact however peer pressure has turned into collusion of peers
When European Union leaders met in the spring to assess their progress they sadly admitted that the objectives of the Lisbon strategy had little chance to be achieved
They could at best now stop pretending to cling to this strategy and continue their progress in other areas
Unfortunately José Manuel Barroso who presided over the summit in 2000 when he was prime minister of Portugal and the active chairman of the European Commission had put his presidency at stake with the Lisbon strategy
We should expect to see him defend her desperately
One of the few good ideas of the Lisbon strategy was to remove the customs barriers for the exchange of services
Competition in services in Europe is restricted by innumerable national regulations which for example strictly regulate professions such as hairdressing and plumbing
One of the key features of recent decades has been the significant increase in productivity in the services field in the U S but this has absolutely not happened in Europe
Guess why
Because the services account for 70 of the european GDP and the potential impact of increased competition is important
However it is always difficult politically to remove the protections
The European Commission has made a proposal in 2005 even as the Constitution was subject to voting
It is hardly surprising that this proposal was quickly abandoned
Today since a large number of private interest groups are trying to dilute it until removing all its meaning this battle is assuredly registered on the agenda of the European Union for 2006
Europe also blocks progress of the Doha cycle in international trade negotiations due to the farming lobby that fights to preserve its subsidies
Many are the governments which fear their farmers to the point of not having any other choice but to not give in whatever the circumstances
Europe has accepted the idea of a trade policy
When the disagreements are as profound as they are in the case of agriculture there is no latitude for conducting successful negotiations
There is little reason to remain optimistic
And what will the future be for ECB which had to adjust its key interest rates by 0 25 after 30 months of waiting
Experts may not agree on the relevance of this decision but no one agrees with the many political leaders who argue that this small increase will derail the slight recovery in economic growth
The acidity of political attacks against the ECB could trigger dangerous debates on the restriction of its independence
Even if it is out of the question that this will happen because it would necessitate amending the Treaty all this brouhaha is not healthy
It diverts the ECB from its objectives and inflates the notion that Europe is a bad thing and above all that will be used as a scapegoat by failing governments to explain away their failures
We can expect other anti bce reactions
Is Europe in a rut
The current team of leaders has been a great disappointment
We nevertheless have a chance to see the light at the end of the tunnel with their gradual replacement
In Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel seems more positive on the issue of Europe and more focused on reforms than her predecessor but her hands are tied by the grand coalition that supports her
In France President Jacques Chirac image by excellence of the leader hostage to its pressure groups swaying in a helpless way towards the end of his mandate expected in 2007
The two frontrunners to replace him Dominique de Villepin and Nicolas Sarkozy both members of the government are clashing as to their agendas for reform but the years before an election do not encourage radical changes
Italy will have to decide if it wants to replace Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi who shows no interest for reforms and European affairs by Romano Prodi a cautious man and former European Commission president
Tony Blair once a staunch defender of Europe at least according to the low standards of Britain may well have to give the power to Gordon Brown who is known for its lack of warmth towards European integration
Fortunately Britain has always been an outsider
Finally whatever the light at the end of the tunnel it may not shine before 2007 after the elections in France
Tame politicians on both sides of the Atlantic
Despite the occasional murmuring of politicians no one seriously doubts the independence of the European Central Bank nor the fact that monetary policy in the eurozone is therefore well protected against political pressures
But the recent death of the Stability and Growth Pact killed by Germany its father with France playing the role of co conspirator and complacent accomplice reminds us of a much needed lesson elected politicians find it difficult if not impossible to give up their immense power in the area of fiscal policy
This situation applies on both sides of the Atlantic
The American Federal Reserve is obviously very independent
But any attempt aimed at limiting the American federal government s fiscal discretion in the way the Stability Pact does as for example the notorious Gramm Rudman Act of the Clinton era always collapses in the end under pressure from the President and the Congress
In the years of election monetary policy can be used to stimulate if not more an economy just as tax policy and therein lies the objective of politicians
But the ill considered use of one of these two mechanisms to achieve short term objectives could create long term costs justifying some restrictions imposed on the latitude politicians have in influencing macroeconomic policies
When politicians can control inflation with a decisive influence on the central banks they can use their power to devalue the burden of public debt thus avoiding the need for extra tax to repay that debt
This was the great lesson of the 1970s and early 1980s when runaway inflation forced politicians to give up this power for the benefit of independent central banks who alone could convince the markets that price stability would be restored
The monetary policy however is not a unique mode of economic policy making
The aspects of fiscal policy could also be delegated to independent bureaucrats in order to keep politicians on the ranks
Why not for example give an independent bureaucracy a few redistribution goals or control over the level of public investment and the management of deficits
An independent tax authority could doubtless apply the long term goals of a society in these areas better than politicians who have their eyes fixed on the next elections
Indeed in principle it is impossible to understand why the monetary and fiscal policy should be considered so different one being fully delegated to an agency bureaucrat and the other being completely unregulated left in the hands of politicians
So why does this vast difference really exist as much in America as in Europe
Because the tax policy is the major tool used by politicians to attract and retain the support of a coalition to win voters made up of pensioners officials and middle class property owners while imposing costs on the losing coalition
It is not necessary to satisfy 100 of the voters but just a sufficient number to win the victory
The map of tax plays a critical role in the choice of groups of voters to buy
The independent tax authorities or tax rules such as the stability pact hinder this political use of fiscal policy which is expensive
After all if politicians cannot win elections by taking money from some voters including future generations which must bear some of the cost to give it to others they must work much harder to show some ability to produce public benefits for all
It is a much more difficult task
Of course the policy also includes the effects of redistribution
Think of the various effects of interest rates on debtors versus creditors
The monetary policy is however a much more awkward indirect and imprecise way of choosing fiscal policy winners and losers
Independent central banks can sometimes be a nuisance for politicians but at least they can be used as scapegoats when necessary a role whose political benefits outweigh the costs of the loss of control over a useful tool
These considerations should guide the choice of the system to replace the stability pact in Europe
It is now quite clear that national governments particularly those of major countries will never accept significant limits on their fiscal discretion
They may have suspended their freedom of maneuver tax long enough to allow the launch of the Euro but in normal conditions national governments will reclaim their land tax
The European Commission must stop fighting a rearguard battle which only serves to undermine its credibility especially in the eyes of the small nations which are the only ones on which it is possible to exert pressure so that they will accept unwanted tax regulations
Realistically the commission can only make requests to national governments to ensure that their tax accounts are transparent and clear
It is impossible to prevent the political use of tax policy
But at least the fiscal measures of a country should not be hidden in obscure footnotes at the bottom of the page in their budgets
Even this limited target can be hard to achieve
A lack of strategic openness is in the interests of astute politicians who want to settle a lobby group while covering the costs of public largesse to the majority of citizens
The rules which govern the behavior of politicians should not be written as if unbiased and well intentioned civil servants were going to be applying them
Politicians are ready to go to a lot of trouble to satisfy their supporters and win the elections
We can at best hope to ensure that the worst acts they commit are done openly
Will the European Union uphold its promises to Turkey
More than 40 years ago Turkey has applied to become an associate member of the European Economic Community
The association agreement in 1963 has created a special relationship crowned by the customs union in 1996
For all these years European governments have been reaffirming that Turkey could become a member state provided it abides by the membership criteria
The formal recognition of its candidacy in 1999 urged Turkey to undertake an unprecedented package of reforms in the area of human rights and the rights of minorities notably the abolition of capital punishment the adoption of guarantees against torture the promotion of religious freedom and equality between the sexes and the restriction of the role of the Army in political life
If the European Union considers that the membership criteria have been met it must start negotiations at the beginning of 2005
The EU would otherwise be breaking its political commitments and would seriously undermine it s credibility in the world
However all over Europe this accession is viewed with skepticism because of the size of Turkey and because of its economic situation because of a fear of massive immigration and above all because of cultural and social differences a euphemism referring to Islam
We cannot deny that some of these factors are huge challenges
But they are often exaggerated and certainly not insurmountable
The negotiations with Turkey would be long and membership might not happen before 2015
This time would allow Turkey as well as the Union to prepare
With 80 million inhabitants Turkey would become one of the largest member states of the European Union
But the role of a country s size is limited in the decision making process of the EU where political influence depends more on economic power
In addition Turkey has for several decades been a responsible member of many European institutions and there is no reason to think it would behave differently in the Union
Because of the weakness of its economy Turkey could lay claim to significant amounts of aid
But these transfers would depend on the EU monetary policy at the time of membership the outcome of negotiations and development of the Turkish economic situation
In any case putting a ceiling on the budget as practiced by the EU would avoid an explosion of the financial cost of Turkey s accession
Immigration should not cause either pointless concern
Human mobility is limited and Turkish workers would probably not have the right to move freely within the European Union until after a long period of transition perhaps not before 2025
Given the strong growth expected in the Turkish economy and the decrease in birth rates experts estimate there would then be around 2 7 million immigrants
Meanwhile shrinking and aging population in the bulk of Europe have made immigration a necessity
But among the most probable countries of origin of the migrants Turkey offers the best chances of successful adaptation
It is the Muslim population of Turkey who raises the most feelings
Many have the feeling that Turkey has no place in a European company based on a culture and Christian traditions
It also feared that Islamists make a fundamentalist state out of Turkey someday
As improbable as it may seem since secularism is strongly rooted in Turkey this risk cannot be totally ruled out
But it exists in any democracy where extremist groups could divert the democratic process to achieve their aims
The best way to avoid such a disaster is undoubtedly to strengthen the democratic system and in order to do that to anchor Turkey firmly within a bloc of countries that are also democratic
As to the European Union it must decide whether it wants to be a Christian club closed or on the contrary an open society strengthened and enriched by its cultural and religious diversity
Turkey s accession would make a strong response with particular resonance in the Muslim world
The need to challenge the arguments against Turkey s accession means that its benefits are rarely mentioned a unique geopolitical location at the crossroads of the Balkans South Caucasus Central Asia and Middle East regions of vital importance for the security of Europe a major transit country for energy supplies military capacity at a time when the EU is developing its new European defence policy and a strong economic potential with a young and dynamic workforce
At the same time one must take into account the risk of rejecting Turkey the probability of the failure of the reform process which would encourage the extremist movements and cause instability and political turmoil at the gates of the EU
Turkey s entry into the European Union opens up broad prospects and also comes with challenges to overcome
But the prospects are far superior
The game of the democracy
In Calcutta where a younger boy went and insisted on participating in the game that my friends were playing we let him come but only after whispered in the ear of the other words
When we were children it was important to master the cruel art of
The technique of the
That which applies to children and adults also applies to international institutions
Indeed the organizations which have officially committed to involving all of the nations in their decision making are often controlled by small groups of powerful nations while others will only make a semblance of participation
The World Trade Organization WTO supposedly founded on the principle of one country one vote in reality has its agenda programmed in the wings by a small group of nations
It is now common for international organizations which publish a report implicate all stakeholders and reflect their views
The evolutive report is generally presented on a website and all without exception NGOs unions and other civil society organisations are invited to make suggestions
This step promotes a sense of participation but as a friend who is well versed in these matters taught me the secret is to finally ignore all the comments received and write the report as if there were no website and as if no participation had been noted
Increasingly free expression of opinion does not influence or control the government s behaviour
Consider the U S
The Americans have expressed their opinion freely in the newspapers on television in discussion forums on the Internet about the Iraq war planned by George Bush
Never before had there been so much opposition to a war
What happened or rather what didn t happen is admirable almost no effort was undertaken to muzzle the government critics as was the case in China and in several dictatorial countries
But the major democracies of the world the United States India the UK etc are becoming more and more adept at banning freely expressed opinions aimed at restricting government actions
The war taking place in Iraq is probably the best evidence
Let s leave aside the immorality of war and God knows how immoral it is I want to draw attention on this growing ability and on the trend of democracies to treat with to neutralize public opinion
They have adopted the strategy of
When the democracies ripen they become more than ever expert in the management of the opinion and in most cases in shaping public opinion
After every comment Hans Blix made about the UN inspections he ran in Iraq members of the Bush administration paraphrased what Blix was saying
This paraphrase subtly modified Blix s comments in order to support America s arguments in favour of war
By repeating the distorted comments the Bush administration hoped that public opinion would be swayed toward the war
It can be difficult to overturn a totalitarian regime and hold elections but the hardest job is to turn the votes of voters into a real democracy
For those accustomed to living in a totalitarian state it is not easy to learn the meaning of the word participation
Hence the popular belief that democracies like wine improve with age
Although that may be true maturity has its own inconveniences
While the citizens of a democracy are continually learn to participate democratic governments learn constantly to reach their goals despite the participation
There is no use in denying that civic participation too often serves only to legitimize shams
We must recognize and address this problem in order to prevent the atrophy of established democracies and to help new democracies to become more efficient
Because it is not only morally wrong to allow nations and communities feel marginalized and without a voice it is the best way to frustration rage and terrorism
The redistribution of governance in Asia
The government the way decisions that affect public interest are taken became a key factor in determining the pace of development of a country A successful governance leads to solved changes
Failures are punished by malaise discontent and stagnation
On April 18th a conference will be held in Bangkok to discuss the prospects for improving governance in Asia
Today s Asian policymakers have to confront a very different environment from that of their predecessors fifty years earlier
The Asiatic population has more than doubled since 1950 mainly in the poorest countries
The political system in these countries was adapted for small stable and rural populations
Today these societies or companies must administer extended urban centers as well as talents and multiple requests from the urban populations
The world economy has also changed dramatically
The increase the flow of goods capital and expertise in the world means that foreign organisations and individuals have greater influence further complicating the task of national governments concerned by the internal management of their own nations
Thus the international institutions such as the WTO have changed the terms of reference from which economic decisions are taken
The changes coming in local economies are equally radical
In some parts of Asia living standards have soared
Region specific foreign investments even external altered the structure of domestic economies
The old models of economic growth however such as the encouragement of exports and the selective use of import restrictions which have been producing good results in Eastern Asia in the last century are less well adapted to the new international exchange laws
So we have to create new rules of the game
In most Asian countries the official rules must be simplified and applied more fairly
A return to the sources approach is essential in three related areas in which the national governments must take control reducing corruption strengthening property rights and the consistent application of legal principles
Few countries can score points in these areas
The close links between business and governments have been accused of being responsible for the financial crises that have hit Southeast Asia in 1997
In some regions of South Asia violent conflicts and the power of interests in place have jeopardized the legal principles
The result of such failures is that the elites flourish while the masses suffer
A clear structure of formal rules remains the best antidote to these failures because they reinforce the informal customs on which so many societies are based
Business is not conducted in court but in the meetings where the confidence and reputation are essential elements
As pointed out by Robert Putnam the social theorist social capital the networks standards and social trust which facilitate cooperation and coordination for the benefit of all is as much a factor as a result of economic growth
Giving power to as many members of the civil society as possible more surely tends to instill specific goals into the efforts deployed to help nations advance
The government the private sector and civil society all have a role in strengthening the social capital
But some successful interactions between these sectors cannot simply be desired without any input and it is essential for everyone s role to be clearly defined
Many Asian governments recognize the need to redefine their role more clearly
Following the crisis of 1997 governments have stepped back a little from the markets recognizing the limits of their ability to act and the importance of allowing private entrepreneurship to develop
However governments have a role to play in encouraging a supportive environment in which the markets can operate
The regulation of control and application are two important but different ways of working let s say through mixed partnerships between private and public sectors that are increasingly used in many innovative Asian economies
The valuable role of civil society in the expression of community opinion that governments cannot attain has also been recognised but its relationship to the government and to the business world is more often characterized by conflict than cooperation
The role of the private sector in the decision making must also often be clearer where companies are too influential in relation to governments their needs to operate in a profitable manner can lead to policies promoting the elites rather than the masses
The metaphor of the game with its rules and its participants leads some to think in terms of international competition
It is not very good since our interdependent world is not a zero sum game where the gains of a nation represent the losses of another
In fact nations are not engaged in a competition between each other as is the case for companies
Commercial trade is a positive sum game where all the countries benefit from the exploitation of their areas of comparable advantage
A good governance can improve this positive sum game and ensure that businesses and individuals in these countries participate in profits
It can be the right thing to consider governments as entities competing with each other to offer a better service to their people than other governments
Which confers an important role upon the international comparisons of systems
In this spirit the conference of the UNCTAD UNDP this month Governance in Asia Underpinning Competitiveness in a Global Economy will bring together policymakers across Asia to discuss challenges facing the Asian governments
The role of government the only player to have the legitimacy of a popular mandate is fundamentally important in the direction of a nation going forward
The private sector and civil society are of course more and more often important partners for governments
The operation of the relations between these participants will influence deeply the future of the development in Asia
The 18 Brumaire of Arnold Schwarzenegger
Replacing a governor that they had reelected scarcely a year earlier with Arnold Schwarzenegger should have brought Californian voters a great pleasure though tinged with guilt
Some members of the opposition in Germany would love to do the same with Chancellor Gerhard Schröder although they have not yet
found the movie star to replace him
Several other European governments have also experienced a certain lack of popularity shortly after their election
This situation is also true in non European countries as with for example the recently acclaimed Brazilian President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva not to mention South Korean President Roh Moo hyun the latter having called for a referendum to halt the decline in his popularity
It seems that today the effects of electoral success quickly subside
Should each country therefore adopt a recall procedure to preserve the legitimacy of governments
Absolutely not
Democracy to borrow the terms of the philosopher Karl Popper is defined by the ability to remove those in power without violence it is then according to this definition a method of trial and error
But the leaders must have the chance to govern
Indeed they must have a chance to make mistakes so long as their decisions do not affect the very foundations of the democratic order
The method by trials and errors entails the possibility of being wrong before trying again
The first error of California voters involves the lure of immediacy which is hardly surprising in a state where instant gratification is considered a value in itself
But this desire sometimes seems damning in post modern democracies throughout the world
Indeed democracy today has adopted a pop culture of fads which disappear as quickly as they appeared today s pop group with its hysterical fans will be forgotten tomorrow and there are many others waiting in the wings
In politics this situation can prove to be dangerous because it encourages quick decisions whatever their importance according to the popular opinion that prevails at the time
The call to an increasing number of referendums reflects and enlivens this trend
Referendums are for the most part snapshots
Switzerland with its usually slower pace and its in depth political debates before the elections is probably the only exception to this rule
In general the referendums are used to measure the popularity of political leaders at a given time whatever the problem at stake
If and when Britain decides upon the adoption of the Euro it is more likely that the outcome of this vote will teach us all sorts of things about Tony Blair and the European Union but very little about the merits of the common currency
Thus the arguments in favour of a representative government remain not negligible
Democracy is governing by organizing debates making important decisions after in depth deliberations which at least in the major countries must be conducted in a parliament by elected representatives
Parliaments sometimes act quickly and perhaps they are obliged to do so but in general they take enough time to examine issues in detail
The parliaments speak before forming conclusions hence their name
Let s take the case of Germany a country in which some leaders of the opposition Christian Democrats group burn with the desire to reduce the Schröder government to nothing
Evidently the proposed reforms that have already been enacted by the government are unpopular and there is little doubt that a year after its re election the coalition of Social Democrats and Greens has very little chance to convince at the ballot boxes
But who can know what voters will think in three years when the government s term ends
In the next election voters with hindsight could realize that there was no real alternative to the policies of Schroeder and it could even be that the beneficial effects expected from these painful reforms become apparent before then
The leaders need time to make and enforce unpopular as popular decisions
They need courage to lead often precarious parliamentary majorities on the road to popularity which has its ups and downs
This is why they are forced to take the most painful measures during the first year of their term only to tone things down when the next election approaches
The precarious partnership of Prime Minister Tony Blair and Finance Minister Gordon Brown illustrates this kind of tactics perfectly
Leaders who never risk their popularity are not worthy of their position
California has thus shown a bad example and Californians will probably pay a high price for their mistake
It will however probably not be as high as the one paid by France one century and a half ago when Louis Napoleon elected by universal suffrage became through a excessively popular referendum Napoleon III this vote being the last one in France until the end of the Second Empire
The Californians of course will not be denied the right to vote but their obstinacy may generate an unpredictable and irresponsible form of state policymaking
It is certain that democracy means a limited period of time during which the world s powers must be able to exercise their power unchallenged
For a democracy to be efficacious it must allow enough time for its elected representatives to take office to legislate and to implement their program
These two imperatives are by nature contradictory but a representative parliamentary democracy is still the best way to ensure balance between the two
Any other regime would be as stable as the ten best pop songs this week
Herbert Hoover and the stability pact
In mid July the high and mighty finance ministers of the member states of the European Monetary Union EMU met to discuss the economic situation in the Eurozone
They have ruminated about the most recent economic forecasts which project an annual growth of GDP in the Eurozone this year at the woefully anemic level of 0 7
Then except for a single minister they all decided that their economy should suffer a little from this scandal or even worse
They have reaffirmed their commitment to the Growth and Stability Pact which requires the Eurozone countries to raise taxes and lower public spending increasing the pressure on their economies
The pact is already pushing Germany into recession the Italian government is struggling to revise its growth forecasts quickly enough not to be overtaken by a failing index of production
Yet this does not seem like enough to force officials to review their priorities
Some European finance ministers still consider the stability pact as the cornerstone of the EMU
Others speak of the importance of obeying the rule of the game
Others believe that recovery must be done in the spirit of the pact even if it remains essential to restore economic growth
Seen from the other side of the Atlantic all these reasons seem very strange
The last time that the American government tried to ensure a balanced budget despite the recession was 70 years ago under Herbert Hoover s presidency at the beginning of the Great Depression
Since a broad consensus is established in the United States on the cycles of economic depression which require the use of the budget deficits to relieve the sufferings to stimulate the general request and to precipitate the recovery
Economists call these cyclical tax surges automatic stabilisers
When household incomes fall so does the income of the public sector
Income tax reductions can increase disposable income
But principally when household incomes are falling the social costs of the government are increasing triggering the recovery of demand production investment and employment
The lower income taxes and higher costs expand the budget deficit but in a healthy and effective way
On the american side of the Atlantic the usefulness of these fiscal stabilizers is not in doubt
Instead with every recession threat the political debate revolves around their strengthening by impetus
No more than it is a matter of fiscal discipline
Every time that proposals to amend the Constitution in order to balance the budget have surfaced the proposals have always offered exceptions not only in case of war but also in case of recession
We understand the origins of the stability pact and growth
Northern European countries particularly Germany and Holland are always keen to maintain a loose relationship between their debt and GDP and relatively low interest rates
When these countries have noticed that the southern European countries Italy and Greece especially used to had a high ratio between their debt and their GDP and high enough nominal interest rates due to their visible tolerance against inflation
The countries of Northern Europe feared that the deficits of the South might finally create a pressure for partial monetarization of their debt through inflation of the Euro or more precisely their leaders feared that investors who were fearful for the same reasons would demand higher interest rates
The growth and stability pact was intended to maintain the debt of southern European countries at low levels and now interest rates are low enough to reassure investors about the fact that national debt would never be allowed to rise to the point of generating inflationary pressure
However if one examines the economic problems of the Euro zone today the threat of nominally elevated interest rates over the long term is certainly not part of the ten major concerns among investors
At worst investors do not fear that a high debt leads governments to slow inflation by printing banknotes
The problems of the European Union are due to a stagnant production index increased structural unemployment a weak increase in productivity growth a useless and unfair common agricultural policy and the forecast of structural adjustments in view of the expansion of the European Union itself
In a certain point of view it is right that the euro zone finance ministers are ready to maintain a lower national debt on the long term this is a sign that the victories over inflation won in the 1970s will purely and simply not be ignored
But it is dangerous to be obsessed by the past
There is no safer way to economic disaster than historial blindness
As demonstrated by Herbert Hoover when one only considers the economic problems of the previous generation one risks not seeing the dangers that are right before our eyes
The ghosts of our economy past
In the famous novel A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens Ebeneezer Scrooge a businessman without a soul was harassed by the spirit of Christmas past
Today economists are similarly disturbed by undesirable ghost when they think about the resurgence of economic woes that were believed dead and buried a long time
Whether it s Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley or Paul Krugman of Princeton the Board of Governors of the American Federal Reserve or whoever it might be in Japan economists the world over are concerned about deflation
Their concerns date back to the economic thinking of fifty years ago when economists had discovered that the only thing to do against deflation was to avoid it like the plague
In 1933 Irving Fisher Milton Friedman s predecessor as the head of the American monetary school announced that governments should prevent large depressions by avoiding deflation
Deflation the steady and continuing deterioration of the prices urged the world of business and consumers to reduce their spending and hoarding their cash
This reduces the ability of shops and banks to repay their debts and can trigger a number of enormous bankruptcies destroying confidence in the financial system which then fuels fear and hoarding
Such incentives for hoarding rather than for spending maintain demand at its lowest and still falling level while unemployment develops and grows over such a long period of time that even politicians and economists who ardently argue against laissez faire policies cannot accept it
Thus is that the solution use the Keynesian monetary policies lower interest rates and tax inflation of public spending and tax reduction to keep the economy away from the Gulf which makes deflation possible
But if this issue was settled more than 50 years ago why does it come back to haunt us
Why does this represent a threat that worries Japan so much today and should we be worried in the United States
At the end of the 1940s those who presided over the creation of a post war international economic order tried to create an international monetary system which a permitted sufficient stabilization of exchange rates so that producers and consumers could avoid the dangers of excessive and irrational fluctuations in exchange rates b allowed nations to establish their own macroeconomic policies and c anticipated catastrophic panics which affect not only banks and private individuals but also entire nations and which caused the destructive international financial crisis called the Great Depression
This results in the creation of the system Bretton Wood where the exchange rates are fixed and variable which became over the years the floating system of the 1980 s
Then came the 90s
Suddenly the incredibly destructive financial crises reappeared following public panic in Mexico Thailand Korea Brazil etc and resembled the American financial panic of 1873 or the Austrian Creditanstalt crisis in 1931
The Argentine crisis at the end of the year 2001 bore a truly striking resemblance to the Argentine crisis of Baring Brothers in 1890 except for the fact that the politicians and international bankers seemed to have a much better idea of what had to be done to minimize the damage than they appear to have today
So if those who built the international monetary system of post war worked to put in place safeguards to protect us from the dangers of international financial crisis created by the popular panics why is this kind of crisis being reborn today
The truth is that economic policies are juggling a whole series of possible disasters tossing from one hand to another the one that seems to be the most threatening and the one that seems to be the most remote
In the United States the Bush administration remains skeptical about the ability of monetary policies to stimulate and wants to maintain large budget deficits to reduce unemployment hoping that the future dangers posed by persistent deficits reduced investments sluggish growth loss of confidence uncontrollable inflation and depreciation in exchange rates can be skillfully manipulated or will not become evident until after the Bush team s departure from the presidency
In Europe the European Central Bank believes that the danger of uncontrolled inflation following a loss of public confidence in its commitment to low inflation outweighs the costs of a still too high unemployment
In developing countries the control of capital in order to prevent financial crises is perceived as an obstacle to the attraction of the capital needed for industrialization and as a potential source of corruption since the financial flow passes in one way or another through the hands of the nephew by marriage of the Deputy Minister of Finance
Flexible exchange rates designed to allow markets to indicate the loss of confidence in the currency put exporters in a competitive and difficult situation compared to the producers of foreign countries whose prices are manipulated by unpredictable exchange rates
Even the policies of import substitution much criticized today were originally adopted by developing countries for good and bad reasons the protectionist closing of the markets in the developed countries during the Great Depression had disastrous consequences for the economies of the developing countries
The ghosts of our past economy come back because the present lessons are still overwhelmed
Politicians and people who decide show up their economic approach as the one and only doctrine
But what they do in fact is to manage the most important issues of the moment at the expense of the disappearance of institutions and policies put in place by their predecessors to control the problems that they received as the most urgent
Ebenezer Scrooge s nocturnal visitors were able to convince him that he was wrong and to open his eyes to his mistakes
Lets hope that today s economists will also learn from their undesirable ghosts

Justification for humanitarian intervention
I visited the former Soviet republics of Central Asia in 1998 to take part in talks on democratic development which took place or should have taken place in these newly independent countries
My hosts were former communist leaders who now assumed the role of more or less democratically elected presidents
Each of them spoke without constraints of institutions democratic procedures and respect for the law
But human rights were a different matter entirely
I have presented in each country a list of political prisoners asking what was their fate
In only one country the president has immediately decided to release a man accused of organizing a coup
But even this seeming success proved to be morally ambiguous
The president had not taken a political decision he had done a personal favour
I had received a gift in itself simply another demonstration of the arbitrary exercise of the strength of the president and not proof of respect for moral principles
In one country I spoke with an Islamic fundamentalist opposition leader who was launched into a long civil war against the government
This man fancied himself president of the National reconciliation committee
Armed guards to the teeth circled him although he strongly supported the concept of democracy
Indeed he regarded this idea as the most reliable way to power because the vast majority of people thought exactly like him
He insinuated in a disturbing way that democracy would allow him to eliminate those who were opposed to his ideas He did not elaborate on the exact meaning of that term
In the democracies deprived of democrats it is even more complicated to discuss human rights than procedural formalities because these rights are not considered rights in the legal sense but simply as fits of conscience or as gifts to exchange for another valuable asset
This distinction is particularly important because it draws attention to the limited effectiveness of official legal standards as a means of promoting human rights
The gap between human rights and the behavior of leaders has led to the greatest change ever in the conduct of international affairs in our time the advent of humanitarian intervention
This change originally occurred outside the established international institutions and the UN system by taking root in a French group Doctors Without Borders who believed that human rights were a more important value than national sovereignty
Doctors Without Borders has introduced the concept of the right to intervention in humanitarian disasters by circumventing the restrictions of classical international law
Moreover the international system quickly adopted and transformed this notion and several humanitarian interventions
The NATO intervention in Kosovo is a precedent that the American Secretary of State Colin Powell has used to justify the war with Iraq
But as convincing as the cause of a military humanitarian intervention may be such actions must be taken under the auspices of the UN Charter
After all the promotion of human rights has been the guiding principle of the establishment of the UN
His task in this area was declared in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and in the Helsinki accords in 1975 which gave human rights legal supremacy over the sovereignty of individual states
However an obvious contradiction exists between the universality and the supremacy of the human rights as well as the principles of sovereignty and noninterference within the internal matters of the states which also form the integral part of the documents of the UN
One way of dealing with this inconsistency is to introduce a new chapter dedicated to human rights into the UN Charter and to reformulate Chapter 4 which concerns the use of force in international relations
The principle of sovereignty must also be redefined itself
The world needs a system for granting legal agreements bilateral and multilateral agreements institutions of appropriate control and surveillance to regulate the use of force for humanitarian reasons
The legal restrictions on humanitarian intervention are necessary because dictators use it too often to justify a criminal assault
Adolf Hitler drew up its strategy when he dismantled Czechoslovakia supposedly to defend the Sudeten Germans and later when he invaded my homeland Poland
As Milosevic demonstrated in the 1990s when he claimed to defend the innocent Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia justifying military intervention based solely on moral principles leaves too much free rein to distort these principles and abuse
This is why the debates on the reform of the Security Council should focus not on the modification of its composition but on its mission
The council must be explicitly accountable for the security of mankind and protection in addition to its current role of safeguarding of more traditional notions of international security
The principle of non intervention in the domestic affairs of a nation has never been absolute and globalization is confronting this principle with a radical challenge
The term international relations presupposes a Westphalian set of commitments among the sovereign nations which has replaced the medieval communities defined by personal allegiance to a king
But the Westphalian system is now in decline so is the meaning of the state borders
