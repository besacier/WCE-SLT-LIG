# SLT outputs

We presents SLT results of the ASR outputs optimized with our new metric WER-S (scale value at 10).

We also provided the SLT outputs of all the scale values proposed in the ASR part and the translation of the ASR reference.

Oracle ASR are extracted from the N-Best outputs of the optimized system with a LM scale valua at 10. <br />
Short description:
 + 1-Best_ASR: translation of 1-Best ASR output (scale 10)
 + oracle_ASR_WER: translation of oracle outputs extracted from N-Best according to WER score
 + oracle_ASR_WER-E: translation of oracle outputs oracle extracted from N-Best according to the WER variant, the WER-E score
 + oracle_ASR_WER-S: translation of oracle outputs oracle extracted from N-Best according to the WER variant, the WER-S score
 + references_ASR: translation of reference ASR output
 + scale_from_01_to_20: translation of 1-Best ASR output (scale from 1 to 20)
 + references_SLT: transation references (post-editions)
