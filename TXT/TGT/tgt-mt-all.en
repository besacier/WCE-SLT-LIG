yet a crucial step for the balkans 
since the world is focused on iraq , north korea and a possible crisis with iran on the issue of nuclear weapons , kosovo happening a little unnoticed . 
the public will soon have the opportunity to again turn its attention to this province during a decision on his fate . 
the united states and their european friends have repeatedly announced their intention to take before the end of the year the difficult decision to separate or not kosovo from serbia . 
this decision , crucial to the future of an unstable region , will test the determination and the unity of the west . 
the talks this year in vienna , orchestrated by the united nations , have shown that an agreement between serbia and kosovo on a " final status " will never see the light of day . 
negotiations are continuing , but , as with much tact the negotiator of the un and former finnish president martti ahtisaari on the security council , they died in the facts . 
no serbian leader will not accept the independence of kosovo , because nationalism remains the dominant political force in the country . 
indeed , prime minister vojislav kostunica , apostle of serbian nationalism , has sought by all means to undermine the interim government of kosovo . 
it is eager to hold a national referendum this month on a new constitution without parliamentary debate serious or the usual training of the public . 
the main goal of this new constitution takes in his preamble , which maintains the kosovo in its status of inalienable part of serbia . 
the kosovo albanians have said that they will not accept no link with serbia , so tiny that it is . 
throughout the 1990s , they are practically out of kosovo managed by the serbs by creating institutions parallels . 
their mass exodus of forced to 1999 and the nato intervention that followed , putting an end to the reign of serbia and establishing a quasi-state under the aegis of the un , has made intolerable any other solution than independence . 
within a month or two , the contact group of the balkans , either the united states , the united kingdom , france , germany , italy and russia , will consider the recommendations of ahtisaari on the final status of kosovo and will propose perhaps a solution to the security council , which must take the final decision . 
in public , all the members of the contact group tried to leave the issue the final status of kosovo open , but in private the united states and some of his allies have said the two parties that they would propose the independence this year . 
some members of the security council , including russia and china , take a dim view or remain sceptical about a solution imposed , and few governments are for the division of the territory of another country , compelling person under any circumstances . 
the choice of the security council to approve the independence depends largely on the possibility of preventing a russian veto , which will require considerable diplomatic efforts . 
the nature of the independence granted is also important . 
the independent kosovo must be able to live in safety and its minorities must be protected . 
the north of kosovo , today largely under the control of belgrade , must not be partitioned of fact while the being no name . 
in order to reduce the blow to serbia , it must be that the security council avoids grant independence so distorted that the new state cannot really work . 
if the security council fails to take a decision on a final status , it will cause a critical situation : kosovo will declare independence unilaterally and all nations must decide not to recognise the new state . 
if that happens , it is very likely that the serbs in the north of kosovo will declare their own independence . 
at a minimum , serbia will strongly campaign against any recognition . 
in fact , the government of serbia are already trying to convince the west to delay the decision until mid-2007 . 
he claims that if kosovo becomes independent , the ultra-nationalist radical party will be there again in power at the next elections , and believes that hold elections as early as this year will spur the contact group to postpone its proposal to the security council . 
in addition , the government has encouraged the leaders of the republika srpska from bosnia to threaten to organise their own referendum on the separation of a bosnia still fragile . 
and they continue to push , unsuccessfully , for the referral of ahtisaari in order to extend the discussions in vienna . 
the timing of the organisation of the constitutional referendum appears to be part of this strategy dilatory . 
some hope that a postponement will stimulate violence in kosovo and pushes the west to reconsider the independence of kosovo . 
this tactic may be working . 
many eu countries are concerned about the implications of the withdrawal of territory of a country , as well as the impact of the independence of kosovo on serbian democracy . 
given the political instability of serbia , they doubt the damage that would cause a postponement in the short term , which would be mostly self-inflicted . 
but postpone the decision would only allow kostunica to find new ways to make it even more difficult a decision by the security council . 
the west must ignore the siren song of belgrade . 
serbian politics will be chaotic and unstable in the near future , and serbian politicians will try to use this situation as an excuse to avoid facing up to the loss of kosovo . 
in the same way , links between serbia and kosovo , whatever the circumstances , will be problematic . 
but a failure to make a decision today permanently on the final status of kosovo will produce a worse situation in the balkans , will hamper the progress of serbia towards the west and its accession to the eu , blames the ethnic minorities in kosovo to a dangerous ambiguity and will undermine fragile states such as bosnia and macedonia . 
the only realistic solution for kosovo is independence . 
if serbia wants to join the west , it must not abandon this opportunity in fall for his nationalist past . 
dawn new and dangerous for south korea 
the decision to north korea to expel the inspectors in atomic energy of the united nations is one more reason to look at the election of roh moo hyun to the presidency of south korea two weeks earlier as a historic landslide . 
the beginning of his term coincides not just with one of the most dangerous episodes of the korean peninsula for decades , but his presidency will also be the witness to a test of relations between the us and south korea to a degree never reached in the past . 
the victory of roh on lee hoi chang shows a change of generation in the korean policy , with a youth determined to win a freedom of movement in its relations with the united states . 
in fact , the differences of generation were the decisive factor in the race for the presidential election , replacing the regional feelings domin√®rent each race for the presidency before it . 
according to one report , more than 60 % of the population of 20-30 years ago voted for roh , creating a gap of 2,3 % in this race for the presidency where were found for the first time in 31 years two men face to face , fighting shoulder to shoulder . 
the position populist nationalist and roh will be quickly and sorely tested by reality when he will take his post in february . 
but one that combines the generational change that brought to power with a strong popular will continue the commitments to north korea , beyond the fact that north korea continues to strengthen itself on the nuclear plan , and the recipe is complete in a dispute with the us . 
roh , a self-taught legal who succeeds the examination of the bar without ever go to university and doing his right , has managed to convince the electorate that it would open a new era in politics , that better reflects a south korea enriched and whose middle class has strengthened , overturning the political games dominated by insiders , the regional disputes and the struggles of factions . 
his style and his rhetoric pushed for the image new ( for korea ! ) to a man of the people involved in the elimination of networks of favoritism and corruption bloated . 
for the first time in modern history of korea , the presidential campaign has really been the place of debates on the central issues facing the country has to face , rather than focusing on the parties and personalities . 
the candidate roh has called for new relations between south korea and the united states , based on the principle of independence and equality . 
thus , he announced no longer want to be in the wake of the us or wanting to travel to washington to take just the traditional picture . he has also promised to continue the policy of president kim dae jung , called " the policy of ray of sunshine " in its engagement with the north . 
it is remarkable that roh has won the election despite the decision of north korea reactivating its nuclear reactors arrested since 1994 . 
a few years earlier , such a gesture would have condemned the candidacy of roh . 
that it has surpassed this obstacle without a change of position on the commitment to north korea demonstrates that times have changed radically . 
the popular envy pressing for change rather than a comfortable situation now becomes the main concern of any average korean . 
the election campaign roh has also benefited from a growing trend for anti-americanism . 
the acquittal by an american military tribunal of two american soldiers who killed accidentally aboard their armored vehicle two korean schoolgirls in june sparked off of the street demonstrations across the country . 
although president george w. bush has apologized to two times for the deaths of two small girls , the requirements continued to accumulate to amend the agreement on the status of the armed forces ( status of force agreement , sofa ) , which governs the legal treatment reserved for american troops stationed in south korea . 
the koreans insist that the american soldiers who commit crimes should be judged by the courts koreans . 
this expression of national pride injured was possible after the extraordinary performance of the south korean team at the football world cup last summer , which helped convince the koreans to full maturity of their country , and this fact can now defend themselves without the presence of the 37 , 000 us soldiers . 
in fact , many koreans who see now the american presence , and not the communist regime in north korea , as the biggest obstacle to the unification . 
according to a recent poll , only 54,8 % of koreans still support the maintenance of american troops in the country , while 31,7 % oppose it . 
these feelings will form part of the test of diplomacy which will give its forms to the presidency of roh since its inception , since it must rethink relations between korea and the united states at the same time as the bush administration is agitated about north korea 's nuclear ambitions and its role in the spread of weapons of mass destruction in rogue states . 
for the moment , the korean voters , apparently insensitive to threats presented by the north korea 's nuclear weapons , support the policy of roh for the maintenance of dialogue and trade with the north . 
under the presidency of roh , the internal politics of south korea and its relations with the united states and north korea will require a total to nine . 
he will stay on the verge of maintaining security in the peninsula while remaining committed to america and with the support of his electorate ? 
reconciling these targets would be a difficult test for even the most experienced politician and the more cynical , let alone whether president roh can succeed is the divination . 
any failure , however , means the prospects so horrific that nobody can really wish him . 
each his path to peace 
over the next three weeks , the israeli army will do an exercise unprecedented : instead of defending the country against external enemies or terrorists , it will evacuate , by force if necessary , 9,000 israelis from their homes . 
the unilateral withdrawal of israel is the culmination of a deep political change caused by two convictions somewhat contradictory that have characterised the policies of prime minister ariel sharon since 2003 : first , that the " road map " initially launched by the united states is going nowhere , and then , that the status quo is untenable . 
for sharon , there is no doubt that the 9,000 jewish settlers living among 1,2 million palestinians in the gaza strip have no future . 
therefore , fault of negotiations , a unilateral withdrawal is the only sensible approach to the reduction of violence and stabilisation . 
this policy has deeply divided israel . the settlers , for the most religious , but not all , have felt betrayed by sharon , " the father of the settlements . " 
today is the israeli left which , although reluctant one realises that the new pragmatism preached by sharon is perhaps the first step in the right direction . 
just as de gaulle in algeria , sharon has redistributed maps of israeli policy . 
these last few weeks have been the framework of massive demonstrations , some nearing violence . number of settlers have declared that they do not follow the orders of evacuation . 
the army and the police have mobilized almost 50,000 troops to carry out evictions . 
this approach by force is traumatic not only for the settlers , but also for many other israelis . 
the next few days and weeks can only tell us if the evacuation happens peacefully or not . 
in the meantime , sharon has paid dearly for its policy . 
right-wing parties have left the coalition to power , it has lost its majority in his own likud party , and his finance minister , benjamin netanyahu , has left his government . 
it is only by inviting the labour party of shimon peres in his cabinet that sharon has managed to retain its parliamentary majority . 
the question is , of course , on the situation after the withdrawal from gaza . 
initially , this withdrawal left many governments sceptical , but they have come to realise , as we say in washington , that was the only thing to do . 
among them , as among the palestinians , some hope that after the withdrawal from gaza , it will be possible to return to the road map and to resume the negotiations which will lead to a final agreement between israel and the palestinians . 
this is a huge mistake . 
even if it is motivated by the best of intentions , hope to revive the road map is not realistic . 
future negotiations will have to deal with the issue of final borders between israel and palestine , the fate of 200,000 jewish settlers in the west bank , the status of jerusalem and the problem of the 1947-48 palestinian refugees . 
the chasm between the israeli and palestinian positions on these issues has not diminished since the failed negotiations to camp david in 2000 , while the fear and lack of trust have only grow . 
try to engage in negotiations in such circumstances would be not only a futile exercise , but could simply strengthen further remoteness and suspicion in the two camps . 
the failure of the annan plan for cyprus suggests that good intentions are not enough -- and the disagreements in cyprus were miniscule compared to what divides israelis and palestinians . 
that is it possible to do ? 
the only rational way to proceed is probably to recognise that the unilateral moves of each side can further promote the cause of the decline in violence and reconciliation final . 
on the israeli side , other withdrawals of dozens of small isolated settlements in the west bank , forcing the evacuation of 20,000 to 30,000 settlers , could prove politically feasible and would give the palestinians a contiguous territory in the west bank . 
on the palestinian side , the consolidation of control by the palestinian authority of a dozen security services and militias would be an important step forward . 
the palestinian leader , abu mazen , acknowledges , but the question is whether it is capable of . 
the palestinian authority could also engage on the difficult path to say the refugees that , contrary to what have said 50 years of palestinian propaganda , they do not return in israel , but will have to settle in the west bank and gaza , areas that will be part of the palestinian state . 
in an ideal world , the conflicts settle to strength of agreements and treaties . 
but in real life , as the examples of cyprus , bosnia and kosovo , the stabilisation and the slow decline in violence can sometimes achieve the same goal , even without formal agreement . 
the lack of plausible alternative , one can only hope that this will also be the case for the israelis and the palestinians . 
a new world ? 
berlin : as old horses fringants returning to sound the clarion , the strategists of the cold war , feel their rate of adrenalin increase while missile defence is up to the headlines . 
admittedly , the defence against missiles proposed by bill clinton ( reluctantly ) and george w. bush ( with enthusiasm ) -- and overwhelmingly supported by congress am√©ricain- does not look like the dream of war star done by ronald reagan 20 years ago : the missile defence programme ( nuclear missile defense ) , american missile defence system , nuclear is supposed to catch a modest number of warheads and does not a full protection against the missiles enemies . 
however the question revives the old debates about deterrence , of mutual assured destruction and nuclear arms control , and revived the rivalry between the nuclear powers at a time when nuclear weapons have lost much of their right to be . 
oddly , even though it is not certain that the missile defence programme to succeed , the debate is in full swing . 
and even if the system works , it will take between 10 and 15 years ago , perhaps more , before it is operational . 
also the words are mounting about something that , if there is one day , may have little impact . 
the governments normally cautious are taking their brands as if the future the expected at the corner of the wood . 
how to explain this strange behaviour ? 
certainly not by a blind faith in technology . 
after all , the history of missile defence is full of examples of technological disappointments for its supporters , that they are part of the government or not . 
no sane person cannot assume that what we have never managed before , destroy a small number of warheads in flight , is going to be a night . 
of the three tests which have been carried out so far , one has missed partially , the other two completely , this is the reason why the president clinton has preferred to pass the problem to his successor . 
if president bush , as he mentioned , practice now in favour of a new formula , it will be even more time to develop the architecture and design a programme of trial . 
and we cannot be sure it will work . 
governments are worried at the moment , not because of what will be possible or not , but about the intentions real or imagined of america . 
although the americans say loud and clear that the missile defence programme is not directed against anyone , that the only goal of the united states is to protect their citizens against states such as iraq or north korea , almost everybody is convinced the contrary : the russians fear that americans do not want to cement their military superiority ( and the inferiority of russia ) forever ; the chinese are afraid that the missile defence programme is a sign of america 's determination that taiwan remains independent , europeans fear that the plans of america do not create tensions with russia and between the united states of europe . 
because what is important is the political intentions and not technical capabilities , it is now that the missile defence programme creates problems : it is pushing russia to the confrontation , makes china nervous and strengthens a european sense of disunity with the us . 
the damage to begin as early as the starting line while the journey remains uncertain . 
the political consequences are further enhanced by the fact that , 30 years ago , the united states and the soviet union have renounced an effective defence against the strategic nuclear missiles . 
normally , a us defence project to the state of embryo , should not cause as much excitement that the missile defence programme . 
but the 1972 abm treaty banned , for an unlimited period , the systems designed to protect one or other of these two countries against such attacks . 
given the way the us proceed with the missile defence programme , they will have to violate the treaty or give a notice of six months to denounce , that the two signatories are entitled to do if they feel that it is their security vital . 
in the eyes of many , that would mean that america chooses to abandon the structure of nuclear arms control built during the last part of the cold war . 
the bush administration claims that , because the cold war is over , the formal disappearance of the abm treaty would not endanger the nuclear stability . 
but stability is as much a problem of perception policy of technical calculations . 
by limiting the anti-missile defence strategic , the old treaty offers some assurance of deterrence to the states have nuclear weapons . 
its disappearance would affect all the other agreements on the control of weapons . 
russia threat of all the tear if the us leave the abm treaty . 
even if this threat lack of credibility ( that would be damaging to the first russian interests ) , it is based on a certain logic . 
the main issue that raises the missile defence programme is not how to prepare for a world of anti-missile defence but how allay fears current policies . 
a few attempts are made quietly in the background . 
legal experts in washington suggest that moderate preparations for the construction of missile and radar sites do not violate the abm treaty and do not therefore forcing the us to denounce it . 
for the moment , the bush administration will await the results of tests before taking a decision . 
moscow and washington suggest all two that a deep reduction of their offensive nuclear arsenal is possible . 
the assurance that the us will participate in the deliberations makes the sceptics european allies more lenient . 
the most important measures designed to gain the trust , a modification of the abm treaty in order to allow a limited anti-missile defence is currently being studied . 
the " niet prior " russia will perhaps final . 
and political turmoil in which are dragged russia and europe subsides perhaps . 
but china ? 
she , she , is not part of an alliance ( as europe ) or a network of arms control treaty with which political solutions can be found ( such as russia ) , and this is one factor contributing to the instability of asia and the chinese nervousness . 
there , the trust can only be built on a rapprochement between china and the united states . 
unfortunately , there is nothing to indicate that washington was not made aware of the gravity of the problem . 
the old strategists of the cold war are very disappointed by this . 
so that they would review the vocabulary and abbreviations of the royal era of deterrence , they discover that he is a world away . 
the anti-missile defence threat not strategic stability between the us and russia but if it is poorly presented , it puts at risk the long term political vision . 
in announcing its determination to carry out a distant missile defence programme , the us has created a political turmoil which they must deal with now if we want to avoid the most damage . 
to avoid a lost generation 
everywhere , the young unemployed to the drift are a source of concern . 
they are especially a problem in developing countries which have a population explosion increasingly strong , the equivalent of the " baby boom' in the west at the end of the second world war . 
but the period that followed the war in most developed countries was an era of prosperity without precedent for the generation of the baby boom that is now approaching retirement . 
the future it will be as promising for the billion and a few young people aged 12 to 24 years of developing countries ? 
these countries should urgently combine investment and political measures to encourage young people to be trained , find work , remain healthy , start a family and exercise their citizenship . 
the benefit is considerable if they succeed : accelerated development thanks to the provision of a young population and the reduction in the rate of dependence . 
in east asia , this " d√©mographique' dividend would be at the root of most of the quarter of economic growth in the region . 
developing countries have already invested a lot in regard to the youngest . 
today , they are better educated and better health than previous generations . 
more than 80 % of the children go to primary school , up from 50 % in 1970 , and infant mortality has fallen from more than 10 % to 6,5 % over the same period . 
but governments must not just invest in favour of children , they must also begin to deal with the new generation of young people . 
however , in countries where the vast majority of children completing a primary education , few of them have access to secondary school . 
young people represent half of new cases of hiv infection . 
in the middle east and north africa , a quarter of young people are without work . 
all this raises difficult issues : what limits access to secondary education ? 
is it illiteracy remains high sometimes , even at the end of the primary , or the lack of resources ? 
why are there not more young people who know how to protect themselves against aids ? 
why companies in these countries plaignent-elles often about a lack of qualified workforce so that so many students find themselves unemployed at the exit of the university ? 
an effective policy in the direction of youth is based on three types of measures : more possibilities of success offered to young people , more skills and the offer of a second chance . 
governments must offer more chance of success to young people by improving access and quality health care and education . 
it is only in secondary education for pupils to take full advantage of primary education . 
yet , many young people are still unprepared to secondary school and squares are rare . 
employers want today of highly skilled workers . 
in countries as diverse as algeria , bangladesh , brazil , china , estonia and zambia , qualifications and inadequate training are barriers hardly franchissables . 
if we want to avoid that young people are stuck in jobs without any hope of promotion or are simply without employment , they must be able to enjoy a better education and training that meets the needs of businesses . 
several countries now trying to facilitate access to secondary education , particularly thanks to programmes of transferts' contingent , which will distribute benefits to the poor families whose children go to school regularly . 
these programmes have enabled us to increase the number of pupils at the secondary school in mexico , in ecuador , bangladesh and cambodia . 
but for these programmes have a purpose , it must be that students have the skills needed to enter secondary school . 
in morocco , for instance , more than 80 % of children are doing a first round of education , but less than 20 % reach the required standard . 
the measures are also necessary to help young people make good decisions . 
a government cannot replace the parents or the community , but it can encourage young people and their families to take charge . 
with the information it needed and a proper stimulus , young people will be better equipped to take decisions about their health or to their future . 
in cameroon , intended for young towns , a programme about the sexual hygiene , horizon young people , has helped to increase their knowledge of the matter and change their behavior . thus , the rate of young women of the use of condoms has risen from 58 % to 76 % in the group who has followed the programme . 
another example : in the dominican republic , the rate of inclusion in the high schools has increased when the pupils have been informed of the amount of wages of those who had reached the end of their secondary education , an amount that they had largely underestimated . 
in bangladesh , the project of assistance to the female secondary school has helped financially girls aged 11 to 14 years to continue their studies and delaying the time of marriage . 
governments should also offer a " second chance' to young people who have failed because of the circumstances or bad choice . 
the corresponding programmes must be well designed , properly targeted and coordinated way to provide adequate encouragement to its beneficiaries . 
thus , in sub-saharan africa , thousands of young fighters -- 100.000 in sudan alone -- hope to rebuild their lives for the time of peace , but they obviously have a need for education and employment , as well as medical and psychological support . 
with the political will , measures based on the efforts of the young people themselves to increase their chances of success and skills , and the offer of a second chance to those who need it , these countries could maximize their demographic advantage . 
they can seize this opportunity for growth to improve their prospects of development , either take the risk of a lost generation , aigrie by the lack of the future . 
the european paternalism 
the italian presidency of the european union is a huge responsibility to reinvigorate enlargement as key aspect of the new eu . 
the best place to start would be to encourage a better attitude towards the adoption of the euro for countries acceding to the union . 
in fact , the paternalistic position of eu institutions to the accession countries threatens to create a two-speed europe which will complicate the integration process . 
the accession countries have taken their share of the market in achieving the commercial integration with the countries of the union sometimes stronger than in many member countries . 
three of them --l' estonia , latvia and the lituanie-- have currency boards or a fixed exchange rate with the euro , as bulgaria , which must join the union in 2007 . 
the others have shown for several years their interest to adopt the euro at the start , in some cases unilaterally , even before entry into the eu -- a position openly supported by the national bank of poland , and to a lesser degree by the national bank of hungary and the national bank of the czech republic . 
however , despite their progress to bring their rate of inflation and interest rates closer to european levels , many candidate countries fear , with the full opening capital movements , prerequisites for accession to the eu , to be exposed to the risk of rulings brutal capital flows and crises cambiaires . 
they have learned the lessons of latin america and asia in the 1990s . 
the adoption of the euro would enable them very easily to escape to such risks and focus their efforts on the creation of real growth for their economies . 
however , the response of european institutions and especially the european central bank and the european commission was negative : the applicant countries entendirent argued that they must first spend two years in the european exchange rate mechanism ( erm ii ) , where aspiring to the euro had to prove what were able their policies . 
at the beginning , even systems board were considered unacceptable , although , as is often the case in europe , exceptions have been made : the country with the systems board could keep them even after their accession to the eu . 
the opposition of the ecb and the commission for an early adoption of the euro is misconceived . 
what should count for the european union remains that the policies of any member state are not harmful to the other member states . 
as the pointed out leszek balcerowicz , the governor of the national bank of poland , the adoption of the euro by the candidate countries creates certainly benefits for the candidate countries while being , in the worst case , absolutely no effect for the current members . 
indeed , the combined economic weight of all the candidates is far too weak -- only 6 % of gdp in the enlarged eu --pour exercise any effect on the euro . 
however , the opposition continues the institutions of the eu has led most of the candidates to abandon the idea to adopt the euro unilaterally , or as soon as possible after their entry into the european union . 
unfortunately , the stubbornness of the ecb and the commission now provide grist to the mill of the populist governments in countries homebuyers who rely on the variation of exchange rates to escape fiscal discipline that involves the adoption of the euro . 
however , such manoeuvres disqualifieraient tax probably a country wishing to enter quickly in the euro zone . 
in fact , the accession countries that have not put in place a system board have seen their budget deficits surge --d√©passant 9 % of gdp in hungary in 2002 and more than 5 % in poland , the czech republic and slovakia -- while large capital inflows have been putting pressure on their currencies to appreciate . 
this trend exposes the real economies of candidate countries to the risk of a reversal of capital flows and crises cambiaires that early adoption of the euro would eliminate . 
ironically , the candidates are lecture by officials from the ecb and the commission on the compromise between nominal convergence and real convergence . 
it would seem that the only imperative to brussels is the growth target of candidate countries , the macroeconomic stability can wait . 
large budget deficits support growth , and inflation is clearly not a problem . 
if this line of reasoning seems familiar , perhaps it is because it takes up more or less the foundations of the planning system is not sustainable by which the accession of candidate countries was suspended in the early 1990s . 
this was , of course , the adoption of economic policies focused on market forces in the former communist countries who brought the doors of eu membership . 
thus , the european institutions should drop their approach paternalistic and take seriously the concerns of the central banks of candidate countries about the risks related to the maintenance of their own currency over a long period during which their economy should open up completely capital movements . 
today , the ecb and the european commission support de facto the positions of the populist governments from eastern europe who already spend funds that they hope to achieve in the future of the part of the eu . 
it is high time that the european institutions address of more serious way the challenges and opportunities that present enlargement . 
they could start by considering the early adoption of the euro by the candidate countries of a more favourable , both for countries with a cash system than for those using a floating exchange rate . 
the european disaster of blair 
when french and dutch voters rejected the proposed european union constitution , everyone has quickly understood that the european project was in a difficult situation . 
the painful battle of last week on the future in the medium term of the budget of the union still has more confirmed the verdict . 
it has also sadly put an end to the british presidency of the european council , recalling that britain continues to maintain its old reputation of exception in the european union . 
the two facts are closely linked . 
in france and the netherlands , voters have not explained why they voted against the draft constitution . 
however , many commentators have believed that this vote expressed their protest against the admission perceived as precipitated the ten new member states , and especially the poorest countries of central and eastern europe . 
more particularly , it would seem that the voters have been afraid of losing their jobs , to the detriment of crowds of migrants from the east . this fear has been widely illustrated , at this time , by the image of the polish plumber cheap . 
the irony , of course , lies in the fact that most of the 15 old member states have refused to new countries entrants complete and immediate access to markets in the western employment . 
in any event , it was too late to protest since the ten countries were indeed become full members of the union . 
but now , the 25 member states must deal with the economic consequences of this expansion , not only on the question of the overall size of the european budget for the next seven years , but also on the distribution of contributing countries and beneficiaries . 
the key question is how the old member states are willing to pay to boost the economies late from new member countries . 
in fact , the battle took place on three fronts and has opposed britain , france and the new member states . 
traditionally , a large majority of the budget amounted to agriculture and the backward regions . 
in practice , huge amounts of money have been attributed to the big agricultural producers , either to the poorest member countries such as greece and portugal . 
these two levels , the new member states expected to benefit substantially the eu system . 
once , in budgetary terms , the big loser of the european mechanisms was the united kingdom . at the time that two thirds of the european spending amounted to agriculture , its agricultural sector was low and therefore , the british have little benefited european agricultural subsidies . 
for a long time , they have complained about the injustice of these rules , especially at this time , the united kingdom was one of the poorest member states . it is in 1984 that the conservative government of margaret thatcher demanded and got a massive rebate on the british net contribution to the eu budget . 
today , the situation has changed in three key points . first , the reform of european agricultural policy has begun and the proportion of european agricultural budget has fallen from 60 to 40 % . 
then , it is many years that britain has a faster economic growth that most of the other member states so that it has become one of the richest countries in the eu and this , even in comparison with france and germany . finally , the new member states are so poorer than the poorest of the old member states that they have a moral argument weight to ask a generous portion of the budget negotiated , whatever it is . 
the start of negotiations , six months ago , coincides with the start of the british presidency of the european council . 
tony blair , the british prime minister , has galvanized politicians by declaring before the european parliament in brussels that it was " passionately pro-european " . 
that was the message that the british pro-europeans hoped for a long time and that they expected in vain since the election of tony blair in 1997 . 
of course , it has never expressed such a feeling inside britain , over the last eight years . 
in addition , since britain has been one of the strongest advocates of enlargement to the countries of central and eastern europe , we would have expected in the budget negotiations , the government of blair is proportionately so generous that excited to new entrants . 
initially , this seemed to be the tactics adopted by the british government . 
but against all odds , it has adopted a position ethically advantageous in proposing to give up part of his budget rebate , only on condition that the rest of the european union ( and france , in particular ) agrees about the fundamental reforms in terms of european agricultural policy . 
it took time for the british understand that since president jacques chirac was a beleaguered president unsound and remaining at the elys√©e until 2007 , but without owning no power , it did not have the resources to endorse such a bargaining . 
once the british have become aware of this harsh reality , they have played their lamentable last card in the management of the negotiations . they have made offers petty and ridiculous , all mainly designed to safeguard the small british interests and , essentially , to the detriment of the new member states . 
what sad conclusion for a presidency opened with great fanfare , six months ago by the statements passionately pro-european of tony blair ! 
the full text of his speech is unambiguous . 
blair is in favour of europe , but not to it . 
he wants to be part of a political europe , but only if the other member states agree to follow the model of economic and social reform british . 
the problem is that economic and social reform is purely and simply a matter of national policy and is not part of the powers of the union . if such a reform was to have taken place in france or germany , this issue would be exclusively discussed between politicians and the french or german . 
it could only be included in the powers of the union on condition that the eu will become a real federation . 
can you say blair that it is federalist , then ? 
of course not ! 
it is above all a nationalist reckless who lives in fear of the furtive tablo√Øde press of his country . 
why , then , so he said his pro-european fervor ? 
maybe he ultimately not thought about the issue . 
europe the challenge of neoliberalism 
for more than 20 years , i argued that the high rate of unemployment of western europe could not persist . 
at the end of the 1970s , monetarists bet that only a transitory and modest increase in unemployment could contain creeping inflation - and open - of the industrial west , and that the cost of a return to effective price stability would have been worth it . 
in britain and the united states , this bet monetarist has had a happy ending . 
not in western europe . 
over the last 25 years , european unemployment has risen to measure that monetary policy is tended and that interest rates were increased to fight inflation . 
but when inflation has succumbed , unemployment has not fallen , or almost not . 
if the rate of unemployment has not reached the levels of the great depression , it remained high enough to make the long-term unemployment , or the fear of unemployment in the long term , a shocking experience . 
the governments of the companies in which the official unemployment rate remains at 10 % or more for several generations have a bad economic management . 
as a result , it seemed to me for 20 years that the balance underlying the policy in western europe -- collective bargaining and ample social insurance , on the one hand , and tight monetary policies of the other , was condemned to creak . 
european policymakers seem paralysed by a double fear . 
central bankers europe fear that their political masters their command to relax monetary policy , the structural reforms needed to unlock the aggregate offers are not granted and that the result is a return to inflation of the 1970s . 
in short , they fear that all the sacrifices made to stabilise prices have been in vain . 
politicians in western europe , for their part , fear the opposite effect . 
they worry that even after structural reforms aimed at reducing the attractiveness of unemployment insurance and motivate workers so that they are going to companies , and companies to the workers , the central bankers will continue to insist to tighten the purse-strings . 
in short , they fear that without increasing the production or employment , the net effect will simply be that an increase of poverty . 
of course , these fears are accompanied by the hope that the structural reforms and monetary expansion work in harmony , provoking a boom in employment and production without causing sizeable increase in inflation . 
but the reality is that no step towards the loosening of monetary policies have been put in place , especially with the european central bank d√©butante , anxious to establish its credibility in the fight against inflation -- and that attempts to structural reforms are hesitant , and small . 
i am led astray for 20 years ago : the systems of western europe have remained stable despite the exclusion of a large proportion of citizens of a real involvement in economic life . 
the growth of the economies of the countries of western europe has continued , despite the heavy burden of 10 % of unemployed , but not as quickly as it could . 
today , it seems that i finally have reason , if not panic , at least concern to me . 
the french have rejected the european constitution , above all ( at least according to appearances ) , because a greater european integration , are they afraid , would result in its wake the enormous costs and the disruption of neoliberalism . 
it is one thing to support the " european project " when it comes to link germany and france so closely that nobody thinks useful to make war to determine what language should be spoken in alsace-lorraine . 
it is another when the european project means that the french workers will face competition from polish plumbers , romanian farmers and sellers turks . 
in germany , voters seem to evict chancellor gerhard schroeder , because his allegiance lukewarm to the neo-liberal project their dislike . 
the problem is that they may find themselves governed for four years by angela merkel , a chancellor almost as attached to the neo-liberal than me . 
i believe that germany would do better , in ten years , with more neoliberal policies . 
but that does not appear to match the desire of the german electorate , which makes absolutely unpredictable the aspect of german politics in four years . 
moreover , the discontent of northern europe towards the central bankers , particularly of the ecb and the euro . 
not that the end of the european monetary union is decided , but it is simply that some have begun to consider a dark future where the end of emu would be put on the agenda . 
which is enough to rattle the prices of assets around the world . 
the successes of western europe since the second world war are among the most impressive and the more encouraging success of the history of the world . 
everyone should hope that united europe today build on these successes , rather than see generations of high rates of unemployment put them in danger . 
for this , the attitude of the ecb will have to change . 
europe needs a monetary policy given that the unemployment rate fell in northern europe is more important than the price stability of the continent . 
the south and east of europe will suffer inflation , it is imperative , because regions develop and industrialize , the terms of the exchange improve , and under the auspices of a monetary union , the regional inflation may be a step to take . 
the ecb should not try to balance inflation in the south and east with deflation of the north for artificial reaching targets across the entire continent . 
rescued by taxes 
what are we owe our arri√®res-arri√®res-arri√®res grandchildren ? 
what measures should we take today to reduce the risks posed to our descendants and to our planet by the increasing likelihood of global warming and climate change ? 
almost everyone -- with the exception of exxon mobil , us vice president dick cheney , of their paid servants and deluded acolytes -- understands that when humans burn hydrocarbons , carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere , where it acts like a giant coverage which absorbs the infrared radiation emitted above , warming the planet . 
similarly , almost everyone understands that the warming of the planet could be more serious , is less serious than the existing models suggest it , but that this uncertainty is not an excuse for doing nothing . 
in fact , rather , it should prompt us to better protect ourselves if we knew that global warming will be exactly according to the projections medium-sized . 
finally , almost everyone agrees that the governments , the nonprofit institutions and oil companies should spend much more money for research on energy technologies without emitting carbon , or able to remove the pollutants from the atmosphere and oceans and so cool the planet by sending more solar radiation . 
it is clear that the rich who must bear the burden of solving the problem of climate change over the next few generations . 
after all , they were able to access industrialisation and wealth in blithely pollutant . 
today , china , india and other developing countries do not have this latitude and it would be unfair to penalise them . 
it is now time to build , not dismantle or undermine , international institutions who will have to manage our response to climate change in the coming years . 
but do we need to do something else now and during the next decade ? 
economists like to think in terms of cost . 
and when they see a behavior having destructive side effects , they like the tax . 
the tax is forcing people to feel the damage they cause where it hurts -- the wallet . 
impose a tax on those who drive the 4x4 in the city , for example , is a way to encourage collective intelligence to decide that the adverse side effects are a good reason to change its behavior . 
but it must be a tax right . 
an suv who travels 17 miles into town and which consumes 3,7 litres of petrol rejected nearly 3 pounds carbon in the atmosphere . 
the tax " greenhouse effect " should be of 0,010 euros , or $ 0,38 1,15 a gallon ? 
this choice will be determined by what we learn over the years , but today , the amount of the tax depends on a philosophical question : how much do we think duty to our distant descendants ? 
the australian economist john quiggin has an illuminating discussion on his website ( 
on the other hand , critics point out that the world today is poor . average annual gdp , purchasing power parity , stands at about ‚Ç¨ 5 . 
one expects that the improvement of technologies and their spread to make the world a much richer in 2100 : with annual growth of 2 percent , it will be almost ‚Ç¨ 40.000 per head in terms of purchasing power of 2006 . 
these critics believe so we have a lot more need today this marginal expenditure of ‚Ç¨ 55 that individuals rich 2100 will need ‚Ç¨ 400 they would gain by being protected from the effects of climate change . 
but what the critics often fail to mention is that the same logic applies to the world . 
average annual per capita incomes are currently around ‚Ç¨ 30.600 in the us , japan and western europe and less than $ 6 , 000 for the poorer half of the globe . 
the same logic that we need more of ‚Ç¨ 55 today that the people of 2100 will need additional ‚Ç¨ 400 wants the rich should be taxed more , since each additional ‚Ç¨ 380 in taxes in rich countries are reflected by an increase in income per head of 55 euros in poor countries . 
in other words , if the rich are miserly today for our descendants more rich and if we decide to allow them to cope with an ecological disaster , we must now be generous with the poor of this world . 
conversely , if we are greedy , today to the poor , we need to be generous with our descendants . 
at least that is what we should do if our actions are based more on moral principles on the leitmotif of leonid brezhnev 's : " what we have taken , we bear . " 
take pharmacovigilance seriously 
the health threats -- nuclear reactors , firearms , and contaminated foods -- threaten all of us , that is why the governments are playing an active role in the limit , through regulations often successful . 
however , the situation is very different when it comes to the safety of prescription drugs . 
in fact , for the regulator , pharmacovigilance is the poor relation of the public protection . 
the scope of the problem is enormous . 
in the united states alone , it is estimated that every year the side effects are responsible for the death of 100 000 patients . 
if these figures are proven , it means that the deaths caused by drugs rank fourth or fifth leading cause of death ( according to estimates on mortality used ) . 
in addition , the direct annual hospital costs due to adverse effects will run into billions of dollars , and this is not to mention the suffering caused by the secondary effects that do not lead to hospitalization ( or die ) . 
the difficulties to determine the causes and effects should be taken into account . 
it is sometimes difficult to know whether the death or hospitalization of a patient is attributable to a particular drug , disease treated or the association of the two . 
this phenomenon is that stress the need to ensure the safety of medicines . 
the fact that all medicines , in addition to their profits , produce undesirable effects among some patients is one of the reasons to be pharmacovigilance . 
there is a need to weigh carefully the beneficial effects and unwanted medicines before the approved and use . 
these judgments vary , depending on whether they are issued by a pharmaceutical company , which expects the benefits of its sales , or by a patient who could suffer a serious side effect . 
the unfinished nature of complicating knowledge that estimate . 
the rush to put new drugs on the market often leads to an incomplete research on their safety . 
more than half of medicines approved causes a serious side effect unknown at the time of its marketing authorisation . 
one example : when the new class of painkillers called parp cox-2 was put on the market , regulators , doctors and patients ignored that these drugs could cause heart attacks and strokes . 
tens of thousands of patients innocent people , perhaps more , have suffered from those side effects before the withdrawal of the first two drugs in this class . 
it is difficult to provide a complete list and appropriate the harmful effects of medicines . 
the rate of spontaneous alerts to the regulatory agencies is low , about 1 % , and the controls are passive in many countries . 
it must also rely on the general reluctance to report the side-effects of drugs . 
doctors sometimes feel guilty and fear the trial , and pharmaceutical companies worry about threats to their profits . the regulatory agencies about they must confront the question " why this drug he has been allowed ? " 
it is particularly difficult to allocate an undesirable effect to a drug when the symptom is common in the age group the user or the disease treated . 
as the risk of heart attacks is important for the elderly , many of whom suffer from pain related to arthritis requiring treatment of painkillers , it took six years to make the link between parp cox-2 and multiplication by two or three of the risks of heart attacks . 
a recent survey harris survey in the united states concluded that 60 % of adults are not confident at all , not be very convinced that drug makers to disclose information about the adverse effects of their products . 
this scepticism is justified : internal documents obtained during recent trials show that pharmaceutical companies often declined to submit information criticism in terms of security to the regulatory agencies , as the law , and fail to communicate this information to doctors and patients . 
one of the problems is that the consequences of this neglect of the harmful effects of medicines are non-existent or minimal . 
it is time to be serious : 
¬∑ citizens and governments must make pharmacovigilance a priority , and commit the necessary resources to solve the problem . 
¬∑ the penalties for pharmaceutical companies that fails to point out and communicate the information on the safety of their medicines should be increased significantly to an effective deterrent . 
¬∑ control agencies must have the resources to enforce the laws for stricter rules are implemented . 
¬∑ the problem of pharmacovigilance must be seen as a failure of the system . 
it is not fair to blame the serious adverse effects to doctors , particularly in the absence of comprehensive information on the safety of medicines . 
the full cooperation of doctors is essential to tackle the problem , but it means that we must put an end to their fear of ending up in court . 
this approach works well in the aviation industry : the pilots who are reporting the mistakes they have threatened to make are not penalised . 
¬∑ patients must be better informed about the risks of drugs they are prescribed on prescription and more involved in their detection and their reporting . 
the instructions printed in tiny letters are unnecessary . 
¬∑ control undesirable effects should be more proactive . 
this request more money , which should come from the main beneficiaries of the sale of medicines : the pharmaceutical industry , in the same way that the monitoring of air safety is funded by the airlines . 
above all else , improving pharmacovigilance will depend , if we want the efforts are successful , the establishment of an independent office intended to promote , coordinate and give indications of the programme of regulation . 
that office is in the uk . 
other governments should follow this model in order to fulfil their role , neglected so far , guardian of public health . 
the virtual enemy 
five years have passed since the terrorist attacks of september 2001 on new york and washington , and yet it seems that the decision-makers have hardly learned about the workings of the terrorist cells and their weaknesses . 
the bush administration is still using the term " war against terrorism " and behaves as if it was really a war of usual type when a government in fight another . 
however , after five years of efforts , the military strategies based on the targeting of a single opponent have only made the situation worse . 
it is time to understand the new model of conflict emerging . 
for the paradigm " war " works , the bush administration referred to al-qaeda as an enemy . 
in reality , there is no great organiser or financing terrorist activities . 
the attacks in madrid , bali , and london , as well as several attempts uncovered in the united states and britain , were all characterised by their organisation dispersed . 
it is plots generated independently who have used the resources of ad hoc , often inside the country . 
these small operations also were a common internal pattern . 
the terrorist motivations differ from cell to cell , even from person to person . 
individuals can be motivated by profit or the thirst for power , or for political reasons and religious , while other act by hatred or for the big chill . 
in addition , there are big differences in terms of the risk , of rewards and imperatives as you climb the chain organisational or that you move from one cell to another . 
the conventional military models are equipped to decapitate a thing which , in this case , has no head . 
the characteristics of this new structure have already been studied in a very different context . 
terrorism is the violent version of a " virtual company agile . " 
a virtual company is a small group who together all alone in organisation just large enough to implement a collective intention . 
the virtual companies are unusually innovative and in the business sector , they are probably the only system capable of creating an effective single product . 
the industry of film production is a glaring example . 
in fact , it is without doubt the business model of the future . 
the benefits virtual businesses from their lightness in terms of stability . 
at the moment , the largest part of the price of a product finance the enormous and ineffective organisation which has assembled . 
almost all the creativity and the resolution of problems are happening in small businesses and are " integrated " later by large companies , including the infrastructure is expensive and fragile , and that retains most of the profits . 
this model is the basis of the business world of today , just as the centralisation was privileged defence strategy . 
when you buy a car to general motors , 80 cents of every dollar spent back to gm , which manages almost alone . 
small suppliers you actually provide 80 % of the value and innovation , but only receive 20 % of the reward . 
ironically , the in-depth research on alternative models have been funded by the us department of defence , which , as the biggest buyer of complex machinery of the world , wanted to goods better , cheaper and more on measure . 
the research found the conditions and the trigger mechanisms necessary to facilitate the constitution autonomous small groups opportunistic and to allow them to behave as large companies . 
unfortunately , the research programme has been cancelled before its findings may not apply to the business world , probably because it threatened to large companies . 
it is often forgotten that defense secretary donald rumsfeld has abandoned a comfortable retirement to reorganise the us army in a force smaller and more agile , using some of these same ideas . 
but the organisation of the invasion of iraq , why rumsfeld had recommended the use of fewer troops than expected , shows a poor understanding of the systems distributed . 
while the troops were deployed in the aim of an entry and a flexible withdrawal , the bush administration ends up using them for an occupation . 
the terrorists have shown a talent greatest to capitalize on the models of operations distributed . 
the crowds of texts appear in the muslim world on the strategic studies of jihad . 
the most famous in the west is the management of savagery [ the management of the brutality ] , but only because it was translated and made public . 
these books ( and trends that they indicate ) become less dogmatic and increasingly complex in terms of adoption modern techniques of management . 
their research include surely the young science of management of the virtual company : how to feed and support auto-organis√©es cells . 
the first lesson for western decision makers , perhaps , is that virtual companies rely on a culture of trust . 
certain kinds of confidence can be based on a concept of artificial " not we " rather than on real values and direct experience . 
it is for this reason that the actions of the bush administration only reinforce the dynamics of the virtual company terrorist . 
bush 's rhetoric , " us and them " clearly defines an " other " and stand as a cohesive enemy . 
his approach " war " aid islamic terrorists to consider the west as a force as united and malicious . 
in the future , the model of the virtual company will shape the way will be conducted business , which will be delivered the wars and probably the way government services will be administered . 
it promises to separate the management of the finances of the production , involving innovations and more rapid economic growth . 
however , if western governments do not develop a deep understanding of how to operate these structures , they have no chance to combat terrorist enterprise agile . 
the expansion as a solidarity 
nowadays , it is often said that the sense of solidarity of the european union has been put at risk , not to say that he has completely exploded , by enlargement to the countries of central and eastern europe . 
bulgaria and romania closer to turn the entry into the eu , and the negotiations to open up with turkey and croatia , it has become essential to question this idea . 
the values and interests of the new members of the european union more often coincide with those of the first 15 members . 
it is true , of course , that enlargement has fundamentally changed the union and given birth to new problems and political issues . 
however , the new member states in central and eastern europe are deeply embedded in the economic , social and cultural development of our continent . 
the ties that bind us have been eroded by 40 years of soviet domination , but this has not changed fundamentally the european nature of these states . 
my country , poland , has always had a profound cultural links with other european countries , particularly france . 
we have participated in all the major european developments in the field of music , literature and cinema ( with , for example , andrzej wajda films of the era 's solidarity , such as " danton , " a french co-production ) . 
in sport , too , the east europeans are integrated for a long time to the rest of europe . 
indeed , before the first world war , the national team of german football was entirely composed of players to the polish surnames . 
but , above all , there is a deep sense among poles , hungarians and the czechs , and others , who feel all europeans . 
what is the real sense of the word " solidarity " such as the dictionary defines the small robert : " relationship between people with a sense of a community of interest " . 
solidarity as the sense of a unit resulting from common interests are also clear within the 15 members of origin that members of the enlarged union today . 
the exceptions prove the rule . 
the lack of unity within the european union on the iraq issue should not be overshadowed the agreements that the member states have agreed on all other important issues in terms of international affairs . 
for the economic issues , the disagreements on a single regulation of the european union , for example , should not conceal the fact that no member state , new or historical , has never contested the community market . 
finally , the enlargement process itself is obviously a symbol of european unity civil social and cultural . 
the fact that it provoked debate and discussion does not contradict the conviction shared by all , old and new member states , that they have obligation to rebuild a continent after 40 years of division . 
remain a few questions which , if they are not fundamental source of division , are worrying . 
should we fear the fact that europe is no longer today a continent judaeo-christian purely and white ? 
the citizens of the european union whose origins are in other continents and whose religion is islamic , hindu , sikh , buddhist or be able to identify with the values and culture " european " ? 
will it be able to feel european as has always been the poles or czechs ? 
these questions are especially valuable , in fact , they cannot be avoided in the case of the possible of turkey 's accession to the european union . 
european integration is driven by the respect of the values of others ? 
is it the share or contribute to it ? 
these are burning questions . 
they are particularly difficult if we consider culture as the cement the future of europe . 
all european countries probably thought from the beginning that new entrants not europeans would be treated in the same way that the polish immigrants were assimilated german in the ruhr in the 19th century . 
the fact that this is not happened , at least on a large scale , does not mean that this must not happen . 
there is only to see the number of respectable citizens of turkish origin living in germany . 
or the large number of britons indians and pakistanis of second generation that we see now in suit tie with laptop to the hand , always between two aircraft . 
europeans must admit , however , that these individuals only represent a minority . 
number of immigrant groups in europe are themselves rejected by their communities the fact of the impossible social and economic integration . 
the constant threat of terrorism has made the insulation of islamist populations of europe even more dramatic . 
the european union simply cannot say the " solidarity " as a central value and do nothing to promote among those who feel marginalized . 
they must be allowed to feel this " relationship between people with a sense of a community of interest " . 
european solidarity may not survive this neglect and did not survive . 
after kyoto 
the treaty of the kyoto protocol is now come into force for the 126 nations that have signed to this day . 
it is now time to start questioning the following point : how to bring all nations , including the large emitters , to discuss what to do after the treaty expires in 2012 ? 
that is exactly what has recently made the european commission as he unveiled his first strategy for a post-kyoto era , which will be discussed by the european council in march . 
while the kyoto protocol represents only a modest reduction of carbon emissions in industrialized countries ( 5,2 % between 2008 and 2012 compared to 1990 levels , with varying targets the countries ) real progress can be made by supporting development efforts and preserving our planet . 
but first , all countries must integrate the climate concerns in the planning of their policies and improve their governance in key sectors such as energy , infrastructure and transport . 
in other words , we must act by being aware that climate change and its effects on the inhabitants of rich and poor countries remain a threat to world security . 
in the end , the long-term approach , probably will include a system based on rules , a system of incentives and investments at the level of technological change . 
the adaptation at national level will be increasingly recognised as a major issue which will require adequate funding . 
the treatment of the effects of climate change and the treatment of emissions reductions should not exclude one another , but be complementary . 
consider the post-kyoto world gives us the chance to start a new dialogue and to consider the new options on climate change . 
the nations could establish a more ambitious goal which would be to limit the change on the long term the temperature of the earth , then to allocate emissions rights between the countries in such a way to limit ultimately temperature increases to an acceptable level . 
that would need to increase investment in research and development on energy in order to develop new technologies and best , a process that must be supported by more solid partnerships between the public and private sectors . 
so far , with only 15 % of the world 's population , the rich countries are responsible for more than 75 % of global emissions of carbon dioxide ( co2 ) , and thus most of the damage to the environment . 
this , however , are developing countries ( and therefore the poor countries of the world ) who are the most vulnerable . 
it is unrealistic to ask to poor countries , where more than 1,6 billion people do not have access to clean energy and technologies , to bear the costs associated with the much needed technological change . 
in conjunction with its partners , the world bank supports financial strategies designed to help developing countries to settle the costs due to climate change . 
so far , more than $ 1 billion invested in projects gef ( global environment facility - funds for the global environment ) and about $ 8 billion placed in the co-financing , have been engaged in programmes related to climate change . 
while the regulatory mechanisms of kyoto and of the european system of emissions negotiable ( european trading scheme ) have contributed to the creation of an emerging market for trade carbon , the interested parties are now worried about the immediate future . 
without regulatory framework after 2012 , the new possibilities of beginnings of transactions based on projects will end by 2006 / 2007 . 
given the long period between the preparation of the projects , and the first benefits of emissions reductions , the project developers have only a few years before them to act before the payments of carbon is continuing to make a significant contribution to the financing of projects in the current context . 
the development of projects related to the infrastructure is a long process that requires between 3 and 7 years , identification via the granting of licences , financing , and the construction , until the first certification of reductions in carbon emissions . 
the projects must therefore be operational at the latest by 2007 . 
the world bank has contributed to move the financing of carbon as a tool of sustainable development and to facilitate the participation of the private sector in the market . 
the bank is focused on the representation of the interests of its countries borrowers , helping them to develop assets for the carbon trade according to their own priorities . 
but without commitment of governments to limit emissions of greenhouse gases beyond 2012 , the carbon market will remain uncertain and the private sector ( essential to the success of the market ) should not extend its participation significantly and sustainable . 
according to a recent study supported by the world bank on companies interested in the financing of carbon , only a society on five surveyed said that it was interested in emissions reductions after 2012 . 
the opportunity arises now to look to the future and mobilise the world community ( all countries without exception , albeit with different responsibilities ) in the search for a safer world , a world that would prevent the terrible risks , environmental degradation and social conflict involved by inaction . 
state of the art or art of the state ? 
september is traditionally the month when the orchestras and opera companies leave the festivals of aachen , salzburg , tanglewood and many other home . 
this session is also marked ( on both sides of the atlantic ) by the return of concerns about the means of financing of classical music . 
life american symphony is eurocentriste under almost all its aspects , except for its funding . 
while the americans rely on private donations tax deductible and revenue to finance displays of classical music , europeans prefer a direct government support . 
ironically , while the defenders of the arts in the united states have long called for the adoption of the " european model , " which has produced a rich and varied artistic life , europe is forced to change course and to guide its system of support towards greater dependence on private money and revenue . 
unfortunately , the european system of direct government funding is a victim of european economic growth slow and budget deficits . 
the problem is especially for the countries that have adopted the euro , as public spending in the arts will be limited during a time by the obligation to keep the deficit below 3 % of gdp . 
the pressure on the european institutions performing arts causes concern on several levels . 
traditionally , the european social democracies prefer to distribute goods and services rare as concerts and operas to a system of tails ( financed by huge subsidies to keep low prices ) rather than by the willingness of each to pay . 
this will now change . 
the defenders of performing arts in europe point the finger at the united states where , among others , even great conductors must participate actively in research funding and play an active role in the local community on behalf of the orchestra . 
they fear that the same thing erupted in europe . 
some conductors , refusing to handle the bowl at the same time as the stick , have rejected important posts in the united states for this reason , believing that it would thwart their art . 
it is said that daniel barenboim has left the chicago symphony orchestra in part because he objected to the fundraising demands expected of him . 
but the american experience shows that use of big names in the field of art , as the conductors , to participate in the collection of funds , does not necessarily in the artistic aspect of the job . 
michael tilson thomas in san francisco , for example , has combined collection of funds effective and artistic direction to propel the san francisco symphony at the summit of north american orchestras . 
the europeans , worried about the idea that greater dependence on private money to mean a conservative programming , should also be reassuring to see that the san francisco symphony has one of the most audacious repertoires of the united states . 
if the public has tastes progressives , private money and innovative programming are entirely compatible . 
the corollary is that public money makes possible an adventurous programming even if the taste of the public tends to be conservative . 
this is one of the reasons why artists in europe like public money ; he unleashes an exclusive regime , beethoven and mozart . 
in addition , the public can come to appreciate a repertoire adventurous to force that he proposes . 
of course , if the public purse are reduced for the performing arts , not only do they have to be more dependent on private money , but the price of places will increase . 
some regret , and prefer the system of tail for obtaining tickets because they fear that higher tariffs do not jeopardise the public future excluding the young . 
but low prices for the performing arts do not solve the thorny problem of access of young people . 
first of all , the young may not benefit from the cheap seats simply because whatever the price , classical music is of no interest to them . 
then , even if they want to go there , it is sometimes impossible to obtain places , which are often more available because subscriptions remain between the same hands year after year . 
what is the point of having low prices , which are predominantly used to subsidise the same holders of subscriptions , if there are no seats ? 
if the taste for classical music must be subsidized , it must encourage better targeted subsidies rather than low prices . 
the best way to attract youth to the performing arts is through education . 
given that the orchestras americans cannot count on schools or the government to provide the basic music education needed to ensure a constant public to classical music , some orchestras are themselves with private money . 
in san francisco , for example , the symphony runs a project called keeping score , funded with private funds to the tune of $ 23 million , which includes a national television series of radio broadcasts , an interactive learning music and school music programs . 
this type of programme innovative applies as much to european orchestras that americans . 
the problem of youth and access to the performing arts exists on both sides of the atlantic . 
just as the poor quality of the music education to the state school . 
if the orchestras do not care about their own future , they may simply not be . 
respect for the law , to the russian 
everywhere in the world , we are concerned about the disappearance of political freedoms in russia vladimir putin . 
the russians themselves are practically the only ones not to worry about this creeping authoritarianism . 
they seem less concerned about the political freedoms that by social protection : pensions , domestic violence , rights of the child or police brutality . 
in reality , most russians are indifferent to the efforts by the government to restrict the freedom of the press and the right to protest . 
this apathy makes my job as a mediator , an institution in the duma ( parliament ) to protect the political rights in russia , difficult or impossible . 
the ombudsman serves as a bridge between the authorities and the people ; it is trying to resolve the conflicts between the organs of the state to citizens . 
my office is open not only to the russian citizens , but also to foreign nationals and stateless persons who believe that their political rights have been threatened . 
we apply the russian constitution , but also the principles of international law and human rights standards , sometimes even in contradiction with our constitution . 
for example , as a mediator , i am opposed to the restriction of the right of russians to be juries . 
those who wanted to limit the use of feared juries supposedly for national security . 
my office has worked closely with the state to ensure that most of the trials are held with jury . 
similarly , my office has defended the liberal weekly novoe vremya , subject to pressure by the city of moscow on the pretext of a commercial dispute concerning a lease . 
the dispute is not resolved , but due to my speech the moscow authorities are forced to take account of the negative attitude of the public in their attempts to censor this newspaper . 
of course , russia offers examples of problems relating to the fundamental political freedoms and much more to the fore , as the dirty war in chechnya or the yukos affair . 
my office is as much as possible of chechnya , although it is not easy for moscow . 
i could spend all my time , but russia account 89 regions and countless human rights problems to solve . 
that is why i have suggested to putin that chechnya to have its own regional mediator , on place permanently . 
the new chechen authorities seem to be welcomed . 
as regards the yukos affair , my office cannot intervene in any legal process underway . 
lawyers for the former director general of yukos , mikhail khodorkovsky , complained to the european court of human rights in strasbourg . 
if khodorkovsky contesting the final decision of the russian courts , it will no doubt appeal before this jurisdiction . 
this is only at this point that i be able to give my opinion . 
many observers point out , however , that the people that are the subject of a criminal investigation should be released on bail and not imprisoned . 
for others , it is not possible in the case of khodorkovsky : it is very rich and could thus easily escape justice and flee abroad . 
that is precisely what made the other individuals accused in the yukos affair . 
all these problems in the field of human rights highlight the unfinished nature of russian legal institutions . 
for example , the duma has put too much time to adopt legislation on the pressure groups , which in most democracies developed clearly defines the behaviour acceptable and unacceptable . 
khodorkovsky might not have so much trouble if such laws existed . 
but the absence of legislation is directly linked to the absence of clear ideas . 
human rights in russia are often flouted simply because the people do not know they have these rights . 
the most important objective for my office is that everyone learns to better defend their rights , and that the authorities are taking into account the complaints of ordinary russians . 
unfortunately , most bureaucrats despise the values of human rights . 
but the real difficulty for my office is not ignorance or legal loopholes : it is the fact that in a legal system inadequately developed such as russia , my authority is essentially personal , and requires the support of the media . 
the notions of human rights is still rudimentary , we can best hope a realization that gradually spread . 
my strategic objective is to make a better understanding of the ombudsman 's office , in order to get more respect and recognition of the citizens and the state . 
it is almost impossible without cooperation with non-governmental organisations of human rights in russia . 
i believe that one of my tasks is to encourage contacts between these groups and the authorities . 
the government 's response to these initiatives will better whether and to what extent the putin government intends to include the political and human rights in the context of his " dictatorship of the law . " 
the pope conservative revolutionary 
twenty-five years ago , the polish people has surprised that one of them , cardinal karol wojtyla of krakow , has been appointed to the papacy . 
some people are frightened , others have shed tears of joy . 
here , as a famous writer , " the second baptism of poland . " 
but even in our euphoria , we did not expect that the new pope is changing far not only poland , but the world . 
his first visit to his home country shortly after his inauguration has shown the world the power of the new pope . 
the communist police has disappeared from the main streets of warsaw , the streets have become models of order . 
after decades of deprivation of their autonomy , the poles have suddenly regained their ability to self-determination . 
by saying out loud that " there can be no europe without an independent poland on the card , " the pope has managed to sweep the colonisation unfair post-war had permeated poland to soviet power . 
then , at auschwitz , the pope said : " i speak on behalf of all those whose rights are unknown and trampled in the world , i am talking about because i am connected , we are all linked by the truth . " 
has this place , in this golgotha of modern times , he has called the poles who remembered their families gaz√©es in the cr√©matoire of auschwitz , as well as those frozen in the concentration camps in siberia , a fraternity devoted to combating hatred and revenge , even justified . 
some see the pope as the man who caused a religious revival ; others take for a man of peace . 
some see him as a defender of the poor , others a criticism of the liberation theology . 
for the people of poland , john paul ii , doing human rights the focal point of his teaching , will be forever the man who gave us the courage and hope , who has restored historic our identity . 
indeed , during the first decade of his reign , the pope has put all its efforts in the fight against the dictatorship , and particularly the communist dictatorship . 
the strategy made by the pope to the catholic church and its ability to mobilise millions of believers to his cause meant that no one can never repeat the question posed by stalin : " how many divisions the pope there ? " 
john paul ii has shown that the moral strength is a weapon powerful enough to undo the division of the world created in yalta . 
perhaps in part because of their strong position anti-communist , the catholic church and john paul ii often receive the label of " conservatives " . 
this accusation suggests that the church cannot coexist easily with a pluralist democracy . 
it is true that in the fight against communism , the church has been polish rather conservative , thank god ! 
it has been conservative in its absolute loyalty to the evangelicals , values to the truth of the faith , to its historical identity . 
for a system which advocated atheism official and the lie legalised , the church has represented a reproach alive . 
however , with the demise of communism , the problem encountered by john paul ii and his church at the moment is the following : in what language the evangelical values can be expressed in a world in which the evil is not represented by a political system , but is present in every soul ? 
what is the message of the pope for the post-communist world that he has helped to create ? 
john paul ii undoubtedly keeps its distance with the liberal ideas and liberal state , he often tax of permissiveness and moral relativism . 
the pope 's statements are often marred a criticism of individualism in the name of the values collective . 
he considers the flaws of liberalism as particularly pernicious in post-communist countries . 
the market economy , despite its successes practices , often seems , in his eyes , miss a heart , and to a human face . 
it sees the market promotes entrepreneurship at the expense of human solidarity . 
john paul ii so passionate about not for modern western society , with its separation from the world of values , and he opposed to the moral sensitivities of companies just out of several decades of dictatorship . 
as alexander solzhenitsyn , the pope tends to believe that it is above all in the resistance to totalitarianism that man can become truly free and preserve the fundamental values of civilisation . 
i confess that i consider the legacy of communism with greater scepticism . 
the totalitarian pressure has indeed created exceptional men as john paul ii and alexander solzhenitsyn , people who consider that religious faith has bought the freedom from the lies and solitude . 
but it has also created men such as andrei sakharov and vaclav havel , who have defended their supreme values by referring to a secular humanism and speaking on its behalf . 
however , for most people , life under a totalitarian dictatorship was certainly nothing ennoblissant ; it was more of a daily immersion in the lies , the spiritual depravity and corruption material . 
that is why the post-communist societies do no nobility or disinterest which trancheraient deeply with the west . 
the defeat of communism has left a large black hole in the souls of the communities , a hole that is now given by ideas of nationalism , intolerance and western consumerism . 
but the intuition first of john paul ii is correct : the post-communist world ( from the east and west ) is a spiritual crisis and the pope wishes to undermine it in to be aware of the importance of values higher . 
indeed , by its words and by example that it shows , the pope disrupts the world : they want to live in the wealth and comfort , and the pope reminds us that we also have to live with dignity . 
no labels can only apply to john paul ii , who often represents a set of contrary : rejection of compromise / ecumenism , tenacity / enthusiasm , intellectual opening / insistence on theological orthodoxy . 
this is a conservative in love with freedom and a supporter of peace which condemns the injustice , but which reminds us that the clemency is more important than justice . 
it is in that it embodies the paradox that is christianity : the sacred principles and sustainable associated with understanding and tolerance . 
twenty-five years after the departure of john paul ii in rome , we poles him remain grateful for having helped us to regain our freedom . 
it is a good thing that john paul ii is among us . 
a world in which everything is changing needs a watchdog to monitor what does not change . 
the syndrome interventionist 
kosovo often plays the role of conflit-test for the concept of intervention " humanitarian . " 
but while iraq between in the spiral of chaos , diplomats and the leaders of all nationalities are wondering again if it is appropriate for alliances of nations or for the international community to intervene when a sovereign country seems unable or unwilling to defend its citizens against genocide or war crimes , ethnic cleansing . 
at the centre of this debate is the so-called doctrine of the " responsibility to protect " . 
as a mediator in kosovo appointed by the united nations for the past five years , i have had the unique opportunity to observe the effects of this doctrine , after nato intervention in the former yugoslavia in 1999 . 
kosovo has become an international experience of building society , conducted by the administrative mission caretaker of the un in kosovo ( unmik ) . 
experience is the right word here . 
indeed , kosovo was transformed into a test tube international intervention . 
i have lived and worked long enough in kosovo to see the result , and i claim that such experiments require more in-depth research . 
it is clear that the need for international intervention in the event of a crisis depends on each specific period , and a rapid response is often necessary . 
however , military factors , where such interventions are envisaged it is vitally important to concentrate the international policy discussions on the rapid deployment of civilian presence and security related to one another . 
it is even more true when the human suffering is caused by community conflicts , as was the case in kosovo . 
the immediate deployment of a civil presence and adequate safety directly after the end of the nato bombing of 1999 could provide appropriate mechanisms of protection against the backlash which has enabled the victims to become perpetrators . 
the peacekeeping forces of nato did not prevent the kidnappings , the disappearances , the murderous revenge and the massive destruction of property by ethnic albanian groups that resulted in a large ethnic cleansing reversed the population non-albanaise serbian ( mostly ) . 
a consequence of this neglect , a residue deleterious social and political behind the current kosovo . 
instead of calming the community conflicts , inter-ethnic hatred is more virulent than ever . 
in addition to the lack of security and civilian presence to reassure each community in general , the lack of legal mechanism to make justice quickly for the crimes committed during and after the intervention has created additional tension . 
this tension is so pervasive , in fact , that any prospect of start the if necessary reconciliation process must now be postponed to a distant future . 
similarly , kosovo , the international community has spent little time to help the veterans to consider their collective responsibility for the atrocities , that their personal involvement has been directly or indirectly . 
without such an effort , try to improve the situation is tantamount to build a house on a pile of sand . 
this lack of foresight and projects on the legacy of armed intervention is not only dangerous for the people officially " saved " , it is also counterproductive . 
when a humanitarian intervention is not structured to ensure a basic security , the underlying antagonism that inspired the speech at the base are that strengthened , not diminished . 
six years after the intervention of nato , kosovo seems further than ever of stability and social peace . 
despite the renewed insurance of the un authorities that kosovo is on the path to reconciliation and real autonomy , the representatives of nato indicate that there are plans to maintain a long-term military presence in the province in order to " ensure that the political process will be put in place with success . " 
this brings me to another key issue : an exit strategy as possible is as important to the success of any future humanitarian intervention that the strategy of entry . 
for international intervention has a real chance to succeed , it needs from the outset to define the criteria of " success " . 
only such clarity can properly put an end to the commitment of international players . 
in kosovo , such a clarity is and has been lacking ; as a result , nato and the un have no clear idea at the time or on the way in which they both need to withdraw . 
one day , someone has rightly said that it is easy to bomb , but much more difficult to rebuild ; it is relatively easy to undo a regime militarily , but it is much more difficult to build a robust civil society and sustainable in its place . 
the united nations general assembly should keep this idea in mind when it begins to codify the doctrine of the " responsibility to protect " . 
the divisions of the right wing in central europe 
eastern europe it will achieve a degree of political stability ? 
since 1989 , the results of the elections have continued to oscillate between the right and the left . 
vicktor orban , the young and shrewd hungarian prime minister it will put an end to this situation ? 
thanks to a brutal programme designed to absorb his political rivals on his right , fidesz ( hungarian civic party ) has managed to have almost as members that the socialist party on his left . 
it has also benefited from internal conflicts in the socialist party , that damaged one of its main assets policies : its strict discipline and professionalism , inherited from communism . 
the efforts made by vicktor orban to bring together under the banner of fidesz a divided right have been partially successful and are unique in eastern europe . 
since the collapse of communism in the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia , the parties of the right moderate are fragmented and lack of a genuine political perspective . 
although these countries has not yet fully addressed several tens of years of communist management , the divisions of the right have facilitated the election victory of the left , sometimes embodied by the former communists . 
the right-wing forces in central europe face problems similar to those encountered by right-wing parties elsewhere in europe , where you can see the social democrats reclaiming the liberal ideas , come to occupy them alone the centre of the political spectrum . 
in central europe , this phenomenon has been amplified by the fact that the parties in power , all political persuasions , have had to privatise the economy and introduce under pressure from the european union , reforms that in the west would have been performed by the right . 
in several countries of central europe , the left-wing parties have been better placed to carry out these reforms that the right , because , paradoxically , they have greater legitimacy for this . 
many people believe that the socialists are not may launch in privatisation or is not set to social protection if there had not absolute necessity . 
in central europe , the fundamental problem of the right is his lack of identity , clearly defined . 
although the politicians from the moderate right claim formally traditional ideologies , liberalism or conservatism for example , their electorate , little accustomed to western political concepts , do not always understand the meaning of those words . 
many opinion polls show that a significant part of the electorate of the different countries of central europe is itself on the right , but decades of communism to type paternalistic moved far to the left , the centre of gravity of the region . 
so a person can simultaneously declare themselves liberal and ask that the government continues to subsidize energy , education and housing . 
under the communist regimes , ideology was merely a tool at the service of power . 
as to this time , even today many people accept formally ideological labels , but does not want that to the extent that they can remove a tangible benefit in the short term . 
this cynicism toward the ideologies creates the brutal turnaround of the electorate . 
the problem of identity is exacerbated by the resurgence of nationalism . most of the countries of central europe in which the construction of the national identity has been delayed by communism succumb to nationalist sentiments that can be manipulated by the politicians . 
although some of them say they are right , the image of vladimir meciar , the former slovak prime minister , are in fact populists demagogues and authoritarian . 
the current situation of the right in the countries of central europe is also explained by their history and their tradition . 
the political developments in czechoslovakia during the past twenty years of communism has alienated the czech republic and slovakia , poland and hungary . 
while poland and hungary have suffered under communism a internal liberalisation that has allowed a part of the activity beyond semi-officiellement communist control , czechoslovakia has experienced a strict regime n√©o-staliniste after the soviet invasion of 1968 . 
in 1989 , when the communist regimes collapsed , the communist parties of poland and hungary have become left-wing parties , democratic and credible . they were able to oppose effectively to the parties of the right that is created . 
but in czechoslovakia , the rigid communist party has not been able to give birth to a democratic party strong , encr√© left . 
faced with this gap , the moderate right has had its hands free and was able to retain a certain unity until 1997 . 
but the absence of a strong opposition has led to the collapse of the right , which is divided and has lost a common language . 
in slovakia , a country in which the nationalist sentiments have played an important role after 1989 , the political forces do not come for the moment on a left-right axis . 
the main political battles between the nationalist and populist forces on the one hand , petrol undemocratic , and on the other hand the forces that are fighting for democracy . 
the threat of a return to power of meciar led all democrats , both right and left , to stand in the same camp . 
even in these circumstances , the right remains divided , allowing a possible return to power of meciar . 
in hungary , the right has been a victim of the opposition between conservatives and populist on one side , and the liberals belonging mostly to urban classes on the other . 
the right-wing parties have not yet agreed to whether they must align the ideologies of traditional western inspiration or on a form of nationalism conservative to the hungarian . 
although the current ruling coalition , made up of conservatives and populist , has achieved some success , the moment of truth of the right is not yet arrived . 
the polish right represents the most difficult . 
its problems date back to the days of communism , when the solidarity trade union has become the main opposition movement to the communists , while the unions are in general to the left . 
since the fall of communism , various groups close of solidarity have wanted to embody the right , trouble in the political discourse . 
christian democrat parties linked to the church and the liberal parties have been to a certain extent marginalised . 
the situation is even more complex than it must count with the populist and nationalist parties . they are relatively powerful , because they can rely on the peasantry which is an important electoral base in poland . 
as in other post-communist countries , it is mainly the democratic forces for the left , which have benefited from the divisions of the right . 
fed up with wal-mart ? 
do you want to know what vid√©o-clip will soon shaking policymakers around the world ? 
the economist thomas holmes , following a scenario looks a disturbing to the spread of a global epidemic , has prepared a simulation dynamic cartographic showing the expansion of wal-mart stores in the united states . 
starting with the epicentre to bentonville , in arkansas , where sam walton opened its first store in 1962 , the blinds big-box [ magasins-bo√Ætes ] giants wal-mart have now increased to the point that the average american now live in less than seven miles of one of these shops . 
it is interesting to note that the shops are moving in the way of the flakes of a flower which is getting and is spreading . 
rather than jump directly to the coasts , since 80 percent of americans live within a radius of 50 miles of the atlantic and the pacific , wal-mart has extended organically through a chain of suppliers in constant expansion . 
even if every new shop steals a part of the customer stores , wal-mart established in the surrounding area , the effectiveness of supply steadily improving helps to maintain the overall growth of the chain . 
we love it or hate , wal-mart is undeniably the perfect example of the costs and benefits of globalisation modern . 
consumers spend considerably less than in traditional stores . 
for example , the economists believe that the food at wal-mart is 25 % cheaper than in a chain of supermarkets . 
the difference in prices for many other consumer products is even higher . 
see the astonishing fact : with some other shops in the same style : target , best buy and home depot , wal-mart account for around 50 % of the increase in productivity america 's much-vaunted compared to europe over the last ten years . 
fifty percent ! 
and the same kind of advances among the chains of wholesalers account for 25 % more ! 
the idea that americans have become better at all during the other rich countries stalled is therefore very wrong . 
the miracle of american productivity and the emergence of the trade of style wal-mart are practically synonymous . 
i have nothing against these great hypermarkets . 
they are a boon to consumers at low income , and offset in part the tepid growth wages that many of them have suffered over the past two decades . 
and i do not agree with some of my friends who snub the shops wal-mart and claim to have never set foot . 
as a consumer , i love the big-box blinds . 
it is certainly the case trading partners in america ; wal-mart alone account for more than 10 % of all american imports from china . 
but i have reservations about the model wal-mart used as pattern director of global growth . 
first , there is the question of its effect on the workers to low wages and on retailers smaller . 
the investigations reveal that , while remaining within the legality , its social policies exploit loopholes in the regulation which , for example , allow it to escape the burden of healthcare costs for many employees ( wal-mart provides health coverage to less than half of its employees ) . 
and the arrival of these hypers in a community crushing retailers long-established , and often turn their personality dramatically . 
yes , up to a certain point , it is the price of progress . 
but the loss of aesthetics and of the community does not depend merely through statistics on income and the price . 
the big-box blinds are not really good-looking , where their name [ big boxes ] . 
if their explosive growth continues over the next 20 years , the americans consid√©reront-ils one day their proliferation as a dramatic illustration of the failure of the models of balanced growth at the regional level ? 
admittedly , many europeans , and others , would treat the simulation video of holmes replicating the development of wal-mart as a horror movie . 
the french may have invented the hypermarket , ancestor of the big box store , but they have never had the intention to let him develop without control . 
the big question for the europeans is whether they can find ways to harness some efficiency gains epitomized by the model wal-mart without be overtaken by him . 
for americans , there is also the question of what to do when the phenomenon of blinds equity-price big-box is . 
if a large part of the american productivity really is reduced to let wal-mart and its cousins supermarkets continue their expansion insane , what happens when this source of growth are exhausts ? 
the american economy has many other forces , including its financial system higher and its dominant position in goods of high technology , but the fact is that the advantage of the united states in this sector has not so far been so striking that the phenomenon wal-mart . 
it is curious to see how many people seem to think that the us will grow faster than europe and japan over the next ten years , simply because that is what happened during the last ten years . 
wal-mart and others are a central element in our modern era of globalization . 
they are not really the epidemic that their explosive pattern of development leaves appear , but their emergence is not completely benign . 
those who wish to emulate the american productivity trends must ask themselves today what they would think the appearance of shops in the form of boxes street politics during their campaign , taking the wages down and causing the death of small retailers . 
the americans , for them , must think about the place where is the right balance between aesthetic , community and small price . 
accept science 
economic progress in the long term is especially allowed by the invention and dissemination of improved technologies . 
the scientific revolution has been made possible by the printing press prints , the industrial revolution by steam and if india escapes the famine , it is thanks to the rise in yields , the so-called " green revolution " . 
the era of globalisation that we live in has emerged with the dissemination of computers and the internet . 
thus , when we are looking for solutions to some of the most difficult global problems , we can also find them , at least in part , in the new technologies that could resolve old seemingly intractable problems . 
take the example of poverty in africa . 
all the possible explanations have been advanced , and are usually the finger on what africans are wrong . 
but a visit to the african villages made it clear that the problem is more linked to the fight for survival in physical conditions difficult than to any other inherent problem with african societies . 
african farmers produce about a third ( or less ) of food less per hectare than other operators of the world , which has resulted in a large-scale famine , exacerbated by the heavy burden of the disease . 
malaria is a unique challenge of its kind , mainly due to the species of mosquitoes in africa , particularly able to transmit the disease . 
other tropical diseases are parasitic scourges equally vehicles on the continent . 
add the practical difficulty represented by the roads in a bad state and the scarcity of cars and trucks , and the economic isolation follows . 
the challenges of the survival are enormous . 
practical solutions are accessible , because of the simple and inexpensive technology can solve some specific problems . 
we can address the low yields thanks to improved seeds , especially suited to african conditions associated with technologies to enrich the soil and to manage water . 
malaria can control through new nets to the long life and a new generation of effective medicines . 
other tropical diseases can also be controlled , and technology practice to get drinking water substantially reducing diarrheal diseases . 
the phones , the internet and wireless local more roads could contribute greatly to break the economic isolation african villages . 
the donor countries are constantly asking for the africans to change their trade policies , their government institutions , their public administrations and more . 
some of these changes are important but rich countries sometimes go beyond their role by focusing on everything , except on how to finance and to introduce practical technologies to solve practical problems . 
the mistakes of rich countries would not to consequence if african countries had enough money to adopt the technologies needed all alone , but africa is so poor that it needs financial assistance to escape poverty . 
the challenges of development in africa are just one example of how difficult problems of companies can be resolved through the development and dissemination of technology improved . 
the same will be true of the best way to solve the problem of climate change caused by man -- another of these seemingly intractable global problems . 
for the moment , the rich countries to alter the global climate with millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide each year by the use of coal , oil and natural gas . 
in the coming years , china and india will also contribute greatly to the increase in the rate of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere . 
and yet no country , rich or poor , did very keen to reduce its energy consumption , worried that such a move could threaten its jobs , its income and its economic growth . 
new technology will make a very important part of the solution . 
already , the " hybrid " car , which combine petrol and battery , can almost double the fuel efficiency and divide by two carbon dioxide emissions . 
in addition , engineers have developed techniques to capture and underground storage and course of carbon dioxide from burning coal in the plants . 
this new technology can reduce 80 % of the emission of carbon dioxide in the production of electricity . 
the costs are relatively modest . 
consider also the depopulation of the oceans due to overfishing . 
the global demand for fish is increasing , as well as global capacity of fishing , the threat of extinction some species . 
a aquaculture improved , in which the fish are raised in tanks and nurseries , is still far from a perfect technology , particularly for environmental reasons , and yet it is very promising . 
during a recent visit to africa , a prominent agricultural stated that in the world , the scientist is more than ever around the farmer , but further than ever of the legislator . 
politicians do not understand the science , and rarely seek the advice of scientists and engineers when they want to solve major problems . 
everything is seen from the perspective of politics and elections , and nothing is regarded as a technical problem requiring a technological expertise , which is why the african poverty is so often attributed to corruption rather than ecological challenges . 
it is easy to dismiss the suggestion that the technology can be the solution . 
after all , technological advances are also asking for a good government , market forces , effective university and more . 
the policy is also a role to play . 
in any case , it is time to recognise that the governments are poorly equipped to understand the technological challenges sophisticated and the opportunities that the world could benefit from them , and that new methods are necessary to ensure that we give to science and technology the position needed to tackle a wide range of global problems , taking more and more urgent . 
now it is time that all the major international agencies and all governments take responsibility to use the scientific expertise and technology they will need in the 21st century . 
unblock the situation in latin america 
one of the biggest headache for the global economy is undoubtedly the poor performance of latin america . 
since the early 1980s , latin america has been blocked , with revenues increasing per capita income slowly ( if there was ) in the majority of the region and with a great crisis repetition . 
many policies were tempted , particularly the liberalization of trade , the privatisation of state-owned companies ineffective and the budgetary reforms . 
however , something prevents latin america forward . 
the lack of robust growth is even more disconcerting in the light of the many benefits and social achievements of latin america . 
the natural resources are plentiful and the fertile lands abound . 
the health conditions are relatively acceptable and all the countries of latin america have made progress against illiteracy , the majority getting at least 90 % of adult literacy . 
in addition , fertility rates have been falling sharply , to achieve a rate which the populations of many countries stabilises probably in the coming decades . 
the condition of women has improved and the girls have equal access to education , with enrollment rate higher than the boys in many countries . 
latin america is probably known for its culture " macho " , but the rate of women in the active population continues to grow and they are increasingly more political and social positions . 
latin america is very proud of other advantages over the long term . 
most of its citizens live on the coast and enjoy privileged access to international trade , and other live in cities , another advantage for growth . 
indeed , the region is not poor according to international standards , but rather stuck in the beach of income means , between the world 's poorest countries and the high income countries of north america , europe and asia . 
why , then , the surprising lack of real growth over the last 25 years ? 
i reject the responsibility on two unsolved problems , but soluble . 
the first is there for centuries : the social divisions whose origins date back to the european conquest of the native americans in the 16th century . 
even more than in other countries , latin america is born during a violent conquest . 
the europeans have permeated the indian population and have also brought back , especially in the caribbean basin and in brazil , massive cargo of african slaves . 
the companies have become racially and ethnically complex when the european populations , indian and african have practised of mixed marriages , but the trend over the long term the european dominance , enslavement indigenous and african-american , and poverty firmly grounded have deeply marked the companies in latin america . 
even today , the income inequality in latin america are among the highest in the world , reflecting the old models of ethnic and racial division . 
the income inequality leaves a large shadow . 
the rich are fighting for a long time against taxes needed to increase investment in the education sector and the health of the poor , perpetuating the profound social divisions and leaving many individuals without the health and skills required by global competitiveness . 
the situation is improving today in some countries , such as brazil , which bodes well for the future . 
in the other countries , such as guatemala and parts of the andean region , the social divisions remain marred by violence and mistrust . 
in addition to this problem , a fundamental failure of the economic strategy has been largely ignored , a failure which is reflected in the major difference between the discussions on public policy in latin america and asia . 
in asia , the public debate is about the technology : how asia it can catch up ? 
asian governments act with tenacity to increase the scientific and technological capabilities of their economies . 
in latin america , the world 's technological revolution is much less discussed and national policies designed to promote the science and technology is rarely climbing in the foreground . 
result , latin america has not been able to draw properly party of global technological revolutions . 
the developing asian countries now produce of computers , semiconductors , pharmaceutical products and software . 
by contrast , even the seller star of latin america , chile , remains largely an export economy based on resources , heavily focused on the export of copper and agricultural products . 
these sectors are technologically sophisticated , but form a narrow base for the development on the long term . 
the situation is far from being desperate . 
brazil has shown predispositions to be an export power technology . 
he has managed , obviously , to export aircraft and many consumer goods sustainable . 
mexico has also started to mobilise a huge technological know-how . 
argentina , chile and other countries could become of agricultural producers , in the vanguard of the agro-biotechnologie for example , if they gave the penalty . 
however , the countries of latin america have not yet tried to trigger a technological revolution , certainly not with the degree of importance , the competence , commitment and the financing of the asian countries . 
such a push could play a major role in the take-up of economic growth . 
such a policy would commit to significantly increase spending on research and development , as did the asian countries developing . 
the countries of latin america must increase spending to 2 % of gdp ( currently 0,5 % ) , in part through public support for laboratories and universities and in part by benefits for research and development of the private sector . they should roll out the red carpet to multinational companies , as asia has done . 
they also need to focus more on training in science and technology and encourage a greater proportion of students to receive a university education . 
according to the government school and for the new universities as well as for universities agrandies can play a big role , as investment in computers and information technology in schools and communities . 
the social programme and the technological programme depend on one another . 
both require companies to latin america to invest more in individuals who are affected by these programmes , so that the latin americans can put itself at the forefront of progress in productivity in the world . 
if these investments affect all the countries of latin america , both rich and poor , the prospects of the region is illumineront considerably . 
house prices : a house of cards ? 
the first major city to know a boom was london , around 1996 . 
this attitude spread to los angeles , new york and sydney to 1997 and paris in 1998 , to miami , moscow and shanghai in 2001 and vancouver in 2002 . 
these cities and others have seen house prices surge since that time . prices are upwards of at least 50 % in constant prices since 2000 . 
this was the source of important windfall profits for the owners but also a source of problem for any person preparing to acquire property . 
today , rising home prices falters in some of these big cities . 
the rate of growth in london and new york has slowed down dramatically over the past year , and is down to 1 % of a real increase in the second quarter of 2004 . 
has sydney , the prices of homes are actually fell during the second quarter . 
is this the end of the boom ? 
no city in benefit ? 
worse still , the mood of the real-estate markets could lead to a fall in prices ? 
no one had predicted this boom , then predict its end is risky . 
housing prices have shown a terrible bottom-up movement against the previous warnings of the end of the festival . 
any prediction about the end of the boom requires an understanding of the reasons for its development in so many different cities . 
curiously , there is no explanation generally accepted because the ultimate causes of the boom is mainly psychological . 
economists prefer to discuss interest rates or the unemployment statistics , factors concrete and likely to be known . 
of course , these indicators were a legitimate role to play in the explanation of the housing markets , but they are not enough simply not to explain the recent booms . 
three psychological causes from all of this : first of all , a change in the perception of the public about the sources of value in a changing global economy , and then growing confidence of the public in the cities " glamour " whose name is known worldwide and finally the simple exhilarating dynamic of bubbles . 
each factor deserves greater if you want to understand the current conditions of the market and discern future trends in prices . 
first of all , the world economy seems more chaotic than it was ten years ago . 
the fall in share prices since 2000 in most countries gives an air little reassuring to financial assets , stimulating the " refuge to the quality " , or in this case to the stone . 
in addition , terrorism is now seen as a problem for everyone , indonesia , spain and russia having suffered their own tragedies . 
we are reassured by investing in stone , and there is little reason to expect an imminent change . 
the fear and soaring house prices to encourage each other . 
then , the public 's trust in the international cities glamour increases thanks to the explosive growth of global communication via the internet and the mobile telephone . 
just as people increasingly admire international celebrities , there is the centres of business , technology and culture -et whose names are familiar to everybody , uniquely valuable . 
as for the fear of terrorism and the lack of confidence in the stock markets , the geographical celebrity seems elastic not to say autorenforc√©e : new york , paris and london are famous , the more they are glamorous . 
finally , the contagion behind any speculative bubble cannot be ignored . 
the current boom has seen the contagion spread inside the markets and through the markets , the rising price of fuel popular excitement -et and further price increases in the same city , and then in other cities , to the other side of the planet . 
the inhabitants of shanghai does not perhaps struggling housing prices in london , but the leaders of public opinion in shanghai know what is happening in london , and all boom is producing in this city makes the possibility of a boom in shanghai plausible . 
by opposition to the two other psychological reasons , the speculative contagion has a natural end . 
a speculative bubble , which is itself only on the reaction to rising prices , cannot continue indefinitely . 
so , where does this leave us ? 
two of the psychological causes suggest a continuous rise in house prices , while the third suggests the end of this movement upward one of these days , without specifying when . 
i bet that some of the cities so strongly glamorous will continue to assist the slowdown in the growth of home prices , and then possibly to their decline . 
historically , the price of real estate has always demonstrated strong movements , and prices in all of these cities is still rising at a rate important , even if it is generally somewhat slower than it was a year or two . 
if we extrapolate the growth trends , it seems reasonable to forecast that prices will continue to grow substantially in most of these cities for a year or two , even if the growth rate continues to decline . 
the psychological factors are more important for the long-term forecasts , beyond a year ago , when the upward movement no longer plays an important role . 
at this point , the prices will probably unstable downwards , because the enthusiasm for investment in stone collapses probably at the same time that the decline in price growth . 
prices in cities glamour will fall significantly to the next recession or when the economy will suffer are next big shock or even if interest rates rise too quickly . 
then the contagion inside and through the markets fall , with falling prices for years . 
water for all 
this month , once again , the water has taken centre stage in the fourth world water forum in mexico . 
this is an opportune time : while the attention of a large part of the world is focused on issues of energy supply and security , hundreds of millions of people in developing countries , still see the supply of fresh water as just as important , if not more . 
the investigations by the world bank in developing countries show that , when you ask the poor to appoint the three most important challenges they face , their " good health " is still part of this list . 
and the key factor that determines whether they will keep this good health remains access to clean water . 
today , in the world , more than a billion people do not have access to it . 
because of this , they are always more easily in the grip of a bad health . 
the world bank estimates that in 2035 , nearly three billion people , almost all in developing countries , could live in conditions of lack of water very serious , particularly if they live in africa , the middle east or south asia . 
this will cause the obvious difficulties , but it also hamper economic growth needed to these millions of people to escape poverty . 
in latin america , nearly 15 % of the population , or nearly 76 million people , has no access to safe drinking water , and 116 million people have access to any health service . 
the numbers are worse for africa and parts of asia . 
this is a situation that few people face in rich countries . 
usually , the citizens of those countries benefit from public services that meet all their needs in water , since the drink until irrigation and health needs . 
in addition , other issues related to water , such as the risks presented floods , have been reduced to manageable levels . 
the rich industrial countries have invested very early and massively in infrastructure , the institutions and water management . 
the results , beyond the health benefits that this provides to all , have provided evidence of a record economic growth : consider the hydroelectric investments to understand the positive impact of projects management of water in many countries . 
of course , rich countries have some advantages : they have generally moderate climates where the rains are regular , and usually pose little risk of drought or flood . 
even so , they are not immune from disasters related to water , as the destruction of new orleans by hurricane katrina we showed . 
but the impact of such events on poor countries is far more important . 
the extreme fluctuations of the rains , floods and droughts can have social and economic effects and result in loss of life on a large scale . 
the coast of the gulf of mexico and the countries of central america are constantly the experience of such tragedies , the deprived communities are the most vulnerable and least able to deal with these events . 
ethiopia and yemen are two examples equally remarkable one than the other . 
the development potential of ethiopia is so closely linked to the seasonal rains that sharp movements in the rain , and the lack of infrastructure , has undermined the growth and perpetuated poverty . 
a simple drought can reduce the growth potential of 10 % in the long term . 
yemen , about him , has no permanent surface water and its citizens depend entirely on rainfall , groundwater and floods . 
to move forward , developing countries need new infrastructure and better management of water . 
any approach must be designed in connection with the specific context of each country and the needs of their respective people , but there is no forced to basis linked to investments of exploitation of water which ensures that local communities and the environment can learn tangible benefits quickly . 
in some countries , the implementation of new infrastructure for the water usually mean the creation of channels , pumping stations and dams . 
other countries may need more profound reservoirs , sewage treatment plants more modern systems or of water transport improved . 
all of this can possibly be designed to improve and extend the reserves of water for energy generation , irrigation , and industrial use and private , while guaranteeing a certain security against droughts and some protection against flooding . 
the key to the success of any increase investment in infrastructure of water st. to increase proportionally investments in the institutions that administer water . 
if the infrastructure is badly managed , this will not help to improve the health of populations or support economic growth : the organisation of water and water management must function pair . 
the infrastructure can and must be developed in parallel with good institutions , well run , in respect of the environment and with a fair share of costs and benefits . 
a policy of investment in the water that reduced the vulnerability of the poor and provides access to the water for all requires a personalized management and a special partnership between the donor countries , the governments of developing countries , the private sector and the local communities . 
delegates from the world water forum will have multiple opportunities to forge and strengthen these partnerships . 
if they succeed , the benefits that will draw the poor people of the world will be immense . 
germany in a state of economic shock 
over the past ten years , germany has experienced economic growth the slowest of the european union , and europe the slower growth in the world . 
from 1995 to 2005 , german growth will not exceeded 14,6 % , while the average of the old eu was 24 % , that of the united states 39,9 % , and the world economy 45,6 % . 
what explains so bad results of germany ? 
according to franz m√ºntefering , leader of the social democrat party at the head of germany , it is simply because the country is already where other people want to go . 
the slow growth , german support , is a sign of natural convergence . 
this theory is far from convincing . 
germany has recently been doubled in terms of per capita income by many eu countries , including ireland , the united kingdom , the netherlands and france , and its growth is slower than their own . 
another theory , more plausible , is that over the past fifteen years several external challenges , or shocks , have simultaneously rocked the country . 
trapped by its rigidity , its social system extended and a labour market very regulated , germany has been unable to react to these shocks and began to meet problems . 
this theory is not without reminiscent of the british historian arnold toynbee that empires crumble because they are unable to respond to the external challenges . 
the first shock was the intensification of globalisation , which has caused the massive influx of competition on low wages . 
even if globalisation is a gradual process , she won in energy when china has decided to enter the game . 
china is ten times the size of japan , and japan had not been very easy to manage . 
the instruments of precision and optical equipment in germany , for example , have lost their competitiveness when japan entered into stage . 
the second shock has been that of european integration , especially enlargement in the north and south . 
the dismantling of the eu 's internal frontiers has expanded all of a sudden the size of national markets and caused the economies of scale envisaged . 
but this phenomenon has favoured the small european countries as the biggest , and has involved more competition for germany , the biggest economy in europe . 
take nokia , the maker of mobile phones . 
thanks to the economies of scale made possible by the common market , nokia has been able to fully exploit its inventions , while german siemens had recently decided to drop the mobile phone market . 
the third shock has been the euro . the european currency has caused rapid convergence of long-term interest rates , which in some countries have reached up to 5 to 7 percentage points more than in germany . 
freed from the exchange rate risks , international investors are asking for more risk premium in these countries and gladly accept their provide all of the funds on favorable terms , what was once the preserve of germany . 
europe is that profits , because the capital are now better distributed and growth driven by the movement of economies of germany to remote areas and formerly disadvantaged in the euro zone . 
however , the benefit is doubtful for german workers who also would have wanted to take advantage of this capital . 
the fourth shock has taken the form of the eastward enlargement of the eu , which has caused extraordinary opportunities for trade and investment , but also the flurry of labor at low prices . 
on average , the levels of wages in the 10 countries which joined the eu in 2004 represent only 14 % of those of west germany . 
low wage competition has led to substantial relocation and off-shore activities that have allowed the german companies to remain competitive in reducing their request of labor national . 
given that neither the trade unions , nor the german social system could not accept pay cuts , the result has been an increase in unemployment and the slowdown in growth . 
the fifth shock , it is the unification of germany , a failure in terms of economy . 
gdp per person of working age in east germany accounted for 61 % of the level of west germany in 1996 , but it is waning today to 59 % . 
the slow growth of the east of the country has lowered the average german , while the huge demand for public funds is widening public debt . 
the weakness of the fiscal position in turn has undermined investor confidence , with obvious impact on economic growth . 
these five shocks are historical developments beneficial for the whole world , but problematic for germany . 
if the country wants to face up to its challenges and continue to grow , it needs to relax its labour market . 
this is that if wages are adjust downwards to adapt to the new global environment that german workers redeviendront competitive , and that the country is again a low unemployment rate , exploiting its human capital until the constraint of capacity . 
the new government that voters will likely choose in september will be faced with the difficult task of putting the germans face reality and introduce the necessary reforms . 
it was only then we will know if germany is able to face the challenge of toynbee ahead . 
the lessons of the tsunami 
many lessons emerge from the tsunami , cause of both of devastation and loss of human life in asia . 
this is proof of globalisation , whereas television showed the vivid images of the destruction of homes in the world . 
indeed , it is in these moments that the world really looks like a global village . 
of course , it seems that the information on the scale of the disaster take longer to reach the president bush 's ranch in crawford , texas . 
but , ultimately , he decided to interrupt his holiday to offer aid that the amount has ceased to be revised upwards in international competition that promised to benefit those who wanted desperately to be helped . 
american aid still seems mean-spirited by comparison with the amounts offered by countries that do not have a fraction of american wealth . 
australia , which is sparsely populated , has offered more than double american aid , japan has promised 50 % more than america and europe has embarked on a sum five times higher . 
this has helped many observers point out that the richest country in the world was in fact the more wretched in terms of international aid , especially when it is compared to the sums involved in defence and the war . 
this disaster is international , so it is appropriate that the united nations to take the lead in coordinating the humanitarian effort . 
unfortunately , in an effort that was widely seen as a new attempt to undermine multilateralism , the us tried to take the head of a " central " of assistance programme , ignoring the relentless efforts within the region and under the auspices of the united nations . 
what that has been the pattern of america , she decided later join wisely the united nations in their efforts . 
the rhetoric used to save the face of the bush administration , claiming that it was set up a core group in the absence of any other effort has slowly been dropped . 
the response of some countries in the region was really impressive , showing the progress made in the establishment of governments efficient and effective . 
myriad details were examined : thailand sent ambassadors in the affected regions of the country to help meet the needs of citizens , " aida " those who have lost everything , passport and goods , to return home , soigna wounded , mit systems in place of identification of the body and traita the difficulties posed by the shortage of body bags and the absence of refrigerated places for the conservation of the body . 
countries like thailand have seen that they could cope with the financial consequences for themselves have asked that humanitarian aid is being sent to other countries . 
they have asked that one thing : the reduction of tariffs and better access to foreign markets . 
they were asking for charity , just a chance to win their own income . 
they have not received in response , at least when i write these lines , that a silence relentless . 
moreover , the g7 has chooses to contribute significantly by offering to alleviate the debt . 
this is particularly important in the case of indonesia , whose debt service amounts to 132 billion dollars , including 70 due to public creditors or guaranteed by the government administrations . 
even without the throes of the tsunami , the weight of this debt would have been a huge disability in the development of this country still recovering from the consequences of the financial crisis of 1997 . 
indeed , the indonesian debt relief is a convincing case to the extent that most of the debts were incurred on the occasion of loans granted to the corrupt government of suharto . 
the leaders knew , or should have known , that part of the total claimed was not going to be attributed to the development of indonesia . 
in addition , a part of the debt was incurred during the crisis of 1997-98 , aggravated and extended by the policies imposed by the imf . 
no one pretends that it is possible to alter or to prevent the forces of nature . 
rather , we must learn to manage them . 
this is now warning systems improved to prevent possible tsunamis . 
we already have , however , received a warning in the field of climate change . 
most countries recognise this and gathered in rio and kyoto to act together : even if it is insufficient , the kyoto protocol was designed as a first step in the right direction . 
unfortunately , the warming of the planet will destroy probably the same countries that those who come to be devastated by the tsunami . 
the islands of low altitude as the maldives will be submerged . 
we are not yet a global village . 
after contesting the scientific evidence highlighting the problems , the biggest polluter in the world , the us , has simply refused to act beyond the simple appeal to a certain voluntary restriction that we see little to work , in america , in any case . 
the international community must still consider the treatment to treat this absurd that refuses to take responsibility for global citizen . 
the optimists say that the technology will enable us to solve these problems . 
the realists will see that in the long race between technology and the environment , it seems that the technology is to this day the big loser . 
nature , as shown by the tsunami , has its own clock . 
until we have learned to respect it , we will miss all the train . 
the accuracy of the experts 
every day , the experts we are bombarded with their views on subjects as diverse as the iraqi insurgents , coca growers bolivians , european central bankers and the politburo of north korea . 
how are they credible , these experts ? 
an optimistic view is that as long as those who sell expertise are competing vigorously for the attention of sagaces buyers ( the media ) , market mechanisms will ensure quality control . 
the experts published in the opinion pages of newspapers , or that go on television and radio , must surely enjoy a good reputation because otherwise they would have been removed . 
skeptics warn , however , that the media we impose their choice of speakers and that they are less interested in the debates reasoned that by how to adapt to the popular prejudices . 
as a result , the celebrity may very well be linked negatively , and not in a positive way , accuracy in the long term . 
until recently , no one knew who was right because nobody preserved trace of the results of these experts . 
but a staggered over 20 years , research suggests today that sceptics are the closest to the truth . 
i describe this project in detail in my book " expert political judgment : how good is it ? how can we know ? 
[ the political judgment of the experts : what is it ? 
how do i know ? the original idea was to ask for thousands of predictions from hundreds of experts about the fates of dozens of countries , and noting those predictions according to their accuracy . 
we have discovered that not only the media are not eliminating bad ideas , but they often favour , especially when the truth is too complex to be presented sharply . 
the evidence fall into two categories . 
first , as have warned the sceptics , when hordes of experts are fighting for the limelight , many are tempted to claim that they know more than in reality . 
the experts providing for the worst and the best are those who have the more inclined to exaggerate . 
between 1985 and 2005 , the experts were the most optimistic forecasts over 10 years that exaggerated the chances of major positive changes both in the financial markets ( by ex a dow jones to 36 000 ) and in terms of global politics ( for example , the calm in the middle east and dynamic growth in sub-saharan africa ) . 
they have assigned the odds of 65 % to rosy scenarios that materialised in only 15 % of cases . 
during the same period , the most pessimistic experts were even more mistaken , exaggerating the risks of negative changes even where the experts were too optimistic in good news , and by adding many other ( i am still waiting for the imminent disintegration of canada , nigeria , india , indonesia , south africa , belgium and sudan ) . 
they have attributed the odds of 70 % to dire scenarios that have realised that in 12 % of cases . 
in addition , as had again predicted the sceptics , experts claiming to know more in reality rarely pay for their mistakes . 
indeed , the media of their pay much attention while neglecting their colleagues more modest . 
you can see this process particularly highlighted when , following the philosopher sir isaiah berlin , we cat√©gorisons experts in " h√©rissons " and " foxes " . 
hedgehogs are those who have big ideas and amourachent grand theories : libertarianism , marxism , environmentalism , etc . 
their self-confidence can be contagious . 
they know how to maintain the momentum of a discussion by multiplying the reasons showing that they are right and that the others are wrong . 
that is what their wins the approval of the media . 
but they do not know at what time based on their mental brake by making concessions to other points of view . 
they take their theories too seriously . 
the result : hedgehogs commit more mistakes , but they accumulate more success on google . 
the eclectic foxes arrive better to calm their ideological enthusiasm . 
they feel more comfortable in the face of prolonged uncertainty about who has reason even in bitter debates , admit their shortcomings and give legitimacy to opposing views . 
they punctuate their conversations of conjonctions which limit the scope of their arguments , " but " , " however , " " although . " 
as they avoid too simplify , the foxes commit fewer errors . 
the foxes are often agree with hedgehogs until a certain point , before complicate things : " yes , my colleague was right when he said that the saudi monarchy is vulnerable , but remember that the states are rare and that the government has many ways to crush the opposition . " 
imagine that your job in the media depend on your ability to broaden your audience . 
who would you choose : an expert who balance of arguments antagonistic and concludes that the most likely outcome is that nothing will change , or an expert who takes the audience on tenterhooks with stories of radical islamists who take control and cause a spike in oil prices ? 
in short , the qualities that make the foxes more inclined to the accuracy make them less popular . 
at this point , sceptics little charitable gloussent that we have the media that we deserve . 
but this is not right . 
no society has even created a reliable method for assessing the results of the experts . 
even the citizens who adopted the accuracy have little means to know that they sacrifice when they change of the chain to move from boring foxes to h√©rissons charismatic . 
it is here that between a modest proposal that applies to all democracies : the market of ideas works better if it is easier for people to see exchanges between accuracy and entertainment , or between the accuracy and loyalty to a party . 
do not liraient-ils more reports of experts who have had the most often right ? 
in this case , the experts could become more reliable showing more humility , and the political debate begin to be less strident . 
okay , it is not easy to create ways to assess who was right and who would cover the whole spectrum of opinions reasonable . 
but in a world where , as yeats , " the worst are full of passionate intensity and the best lack any conviction , " it is worth trying . 
what future for europe ? 
in many aspects , 2005 represents the annus horibilis of europe . 
it has started well , with the approval of the proposed constitutional treaty by the spanish voters , but it has turned sour when french and dutch voters rejected it shortly after . 
those votes reflected in part the discontent of voters towards the internal policies as well as their disappointment with the conduct of government of european affairs . 
governments are then sent to offer them always more of these cases unsatisfactory . 
in the days after those elections , they do not inveigled to agree on the european union budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 . 
the french and british leaders have engaged in a dispute that has wrecked the summit which followed , just before britain takes over the rotating presidency of the european union in july . 
generally , the countries concerned use the presidency of the european union to demonstrate their ability to solve the problems and to push the european union . 
but , since the beginning of december , britain sleeps . 
in addition to the funeral of the proposed constitutional treaty , it has largely abandoned the issue of the budget . 
there is very little chance that it reaches to adopt the budget this year , and , at least to quickly resolve the dispute , the european union will have no operating budget for 2007 . 
even if the budget will eventually be adopted , the austrian presidency , which opens on january 1 , will definitely not depressing affairs . 
the biggest problem is the inability to accelerate its growth and to offer jobs to its citizens . 
this is mainly due to the big three , france , germany and italy , which produce 70 % of european gdp . 
the collective response , adopted in 2000 , was the " lisbon strategy " , which aims to make the european union " the most dynamic economy and more competitive in the field of knowledge in the world " in 2010 . 
a more realistic , it is designed to offer governments the necessary encouragement for the care of reforms of everything that slows economic growth and productivity . 
this means the clash of a myriad of interest groups , since the industrial lobbies until the unions and the frozen bureaucrats , who have ( so far ) managed to protect their area . 
the strategy is based on the peer pressure and is to point the finger at the governments , which are not going to confuse them . 
in fact , however , the peer pressure turned into collusion of peers . 
when the leaders of the european union met last spring to take stock of their progress , they have admitted a pitiful that the objectives of the lisbon strategy had little chance to be achieved . 
they could , at best , now , stop pretending to be this strategy and continue their progress in other areas . 
unfortunately , jos√© manuel barroso , who presided over the summit in 2000 , when he was prime minister of portugal and president of the european commission , had put his presidency in stake in the case of the lisbon strategy . 
we must expect to see the defend so desperate . 
one of the few good ideas to the lisbon strategy was to remove the barriers for the exchange of services . 
the competition of services in europe is restricted by countless national regulations which , for example , determine strictly regulated professions , such as hairdressing or plumbing . 
one of the key features of recent decades is the significant increase in productivity in the field of services in the united states , but this is absolutely not happened in europe . 
guess why . 
because the services account for 70 % of european gdp and the potential impact of a competition improved is important . 
however , it is always difficult , politically , to remove the protections . 
the european commission has made a proposal in 2005 , at the same time that the constitution was put to the vote . 
it is hardly surprising that this proposal has quickly was abandoned . 
today , while a large number of groups of private interests are trying to dilute it up to strip it of all its meaning , this battle will certainly be included in the agenda of the european union for 2006 . 
europe also blocks progress of the doha round in international trade negotiations , the fact of the agricultural lobby who fight to preserve its subsidies . 
many governments fear their farmers at the point of having no choice other than to not give in , whatever the circumstances . 
europe has accepted the idea of a single trade policy . 
when the differences are as deep as they are in the case of agriculture , there is no latitude for successful negotiations . 
there is little reason to remain optimistic . 
and what will the future of the ecb , which has just adjust its interest rate from 0,25 % after 30 months of waiting . 
the experts may not agree on the relevance of this decision , but no one is in agreement with the many political leaders who say that this small increase will derail the small resumption of economic growth . 
the acidity of political attacks against the ecb could trigger dangerous debates on the restriction of its independence . 
even if it is out of the question that to happen , because it would require changing the european treaty , all the noise is not healthy . 
it deflects the ecb its objectives and has flesh out the idea that europe is a bad thing , and , above all , it will be used as a scapegoat by the governments failing to explain their failures . 
we can expect other reactions anti-bce . 
is europe in a rut ? 
the current team of leaders has greatly disappointed . 
yet we have a chance to see the light at the end of the tunnel with their gradual replacement . 
in germany , the chancellor , angela merkel , seems more positive on the issue of europe and more focused on the reforms that his predecessor , but it has the hands linked by the grand coalition that supports it . 
in france , president jacques chirac , image par excellence of the leader hostage to its pressure groups , unsteady , so powerless towards the end of his mandate scheduled for 2007 . 
the two leaders appointed to replace it , dominique de villepin and nicolas sarkozy , both in government , clashing on the bottom of the agendas of reform , but the previous years an election do not encourage radical changes . 
italy , for its part , will have to decide if it wants to replace the prime minister , silvio berlusconi , who shows no interest in the reforms and european affairs , by romano prodi , man prudent and former president of the european commission . 
tony blair , once an ardent defender of europe ( at least according to the demanding standards of great britain ) , may well have to cede finally power to gordon brown , who is well known for his lack of warmth towards european integration . 
fortunately , britain has always is an outsider . 
finally , whatever the light at the end of the tunnel , it shines perhaps not before 2007 , after the french elections . 
tame politicians on both sides of the atlantic 
despite the occasional ronchonnements politicians , nobody seriously doubt the independence of the european central bank nor the fact that the monetary policy in force in the euro zone is therefore well protected against political pressures . 
but the recent death of the stability and growth pact , killed by germany , his father , with a france playing the role of co-conspirateur and complicit complacent , reminds us of a key lesson : elected politicians are difficult , if not impossible , to abandon an immense power in the area of tax policy . 
this situation applies across the atlantic . 
the us federal reserve is , of course , extremely independent . 
but any attempt to limit the fiscal discretion of the us federal government in the way of the stability pact ( for example , the law gramm / rudman notorious of the clinton era ) collapses always at the end to the pressure of the president and congress . 
in the years of election , monetary policy can be used to stimulate , if not more , an economy , just as tax policy , and that is the objective of politicians . 
but the unconsidered use of one of these two mechanisms in order to achieve short-term goals could create long-term costs , justifying certain restrictions imposed on the latitude that have politicians to influence the macroeconomic policies . 
when politicians can control inflation in exercising a decisive influence on the central banks , they can use their power to devalue the burden of public debt , thus avoiding the need for an additional tax to repay this debt . 
this has been the great lesson of the 1970s and early 1980s , when a rampant inflation has forced politicians to renounce this power to the benefit of independent central banks which only could convince the markets that price stability would be restored . 
the monetary policy , however , is not a single method of drafting economic policies . 
the aspects of fiscal policy could also be delegated to independent bureaucrats in order to keep the politicians on the ranks . 
why not , for example , given to an independent bureaucracy a few goals of redistribution or control over the level of public investment or management of the deficits ? 
an independent tax authority could probably apply the long-term objectives of a society in these areas better than the politicians who have their eyes set on the next elections . 
indeed , in principle , it is impossible to understand why the monetary policy and fiscal policy must be considered so differently , one being fully delegated to an agency bureaucrat and the other being completely discretionary and left in the hands of politicians . 
so , why this vast difference it exists in reality , both in america and in europe ? 
because the fiscal policy is the major tool used by politicians to attract and retain the support of a winning coalition of voters , composed of pensioners , officials and owners of the middle classes , while imposing costs on the coalition loser . 
it is not necessary to keep 100 % of the voters , but just a sufficient number to victory . 
the fiscal card plays a critical role in the choice of groups of voters to buy . 
the independent tax authorities ( or tax rules such as the stability pact ) hinder this political use of fiscal policy , which is expensive . 
after all , if politicians cannot win elections by taking the money of a few voters ( including future generations , who will have to bear part of the bill ) to restore to others , they will have to work much harder to show some ability to produce public benefits for all . 
this is a task much more difficult ! 
of course , the policy also includes effects of redistribution . 
think of the various effects of interest rates on debtors by opposition to the creditors . 
monetary policy is , however , a rather more clumsy , indirect and imprecise to choose the winners and losers that fiscal policy . 
independent central banks can sometimes be an embarrassment for the politicians , but at least they can serve as scapegoats when it is needed , a role which the political benefits outweigh the costs of the loss of control on a useful tool . 
these considerations should guide the choice of the system to replace the stability pact in europe . 
it is now quite clear that national governments , especially those of the large countries , will never accept limits on their hefty fiscal discretion . 
they can have temporarily withdrawn their freedom of manoeuvre in fiscal policy long enough to allow the launch of the euro , but in normal conditions , the national governments will claim their tax territory . 
the european commission must therefore cease to deliver a rearguard action that only weaken its credibility , particularly in the eyes of small countries , which are the only ones on which it is possible to apply pressure to accept unwanted fiscal rules . 
realistically , the commission can only ask the european national governments to ensure that their tax accounts are transparent and clear . 
it is impossible to prevent the use of fiscal policy . 
but at least the fiscal measures of a country should not be hidden in the notes obscure footnote in its budgets . 
even this limited target can be hard to achieve . 
a strategic lack of transparency is in the interest of astute politicians who want to keep a pressure group , by concealing the costs of the largesse of the public to the majority of citizens . 
the rules governing the behaviour of politicians must not be written as if officials disinterested and well-intentioned would apply them . 
politicians are ready to give a lot of trouble to satisfy their supporters and win elections . 
we can best hope to ensure that the worst acts they commit to be made to face discovered . 
the european union it will keep its promises to turkey ? 
there are more than 40 years , turkey has asked to become an associate member of the european economic community . 
the association agreement in 1963 has created a special relationship , crowned by the customs union in 1996 . 
for all these years , european governments have continued to reaffirm that turkey could become a fully-fledged member state , provided to respect the membership criteria . 
formal recognition of his candidacy in 1999 has pushed turkey to take a set of reforms without precedent in the field of human rights and the rights of minorities , especially the abolition of the death penalty , the adoption of guarantees against torture , the promotion of religious freedoms and the equality between the sexes and restricting the role of the army in political life . 
if the european union considers the membership criteria were met , it must begin negotiations at the beginning of the year 2005 . 
otherwise the eu reneging on its political commitments and seriously undermine his credibility in the world . 
yet , a little everywhere in europe , this membership is viewed with skepticism , because of the size of turkey and its economic situation , for fear of mass immigration and especially of " cultural and social differences , " a euphemism refers to islam . 
we cannot deny that some of these factors are considerable challenges . 
but they are often exaggerated and certainly not insurmountable . 
negotiations with turkey would be long and membership might not happen before 2015 . 
this period would allow turkey as the union to prepare . 
with 80 million inhabitants , turkey would become one of the largest member states of the european union . 
but the role of the size of the country is limited in the eu decision-making process , where the political influence depends more on the economic power . 
in addition , turkey is for several decades a responsible member of many european institutions , and there is no reason to think that it behaving differently in the union . 
because of the weakness of its economy , turkey could claim to be substantial subsidies . 
but these transfers would depend on financial policy of the eu at the time of the membership , the result of negotiations and the evolution of the economic situation . 
in all cases , the " cap " the budget practised by the eu would an explosion of financial cost of turkey 's accession . 
immigration should not cause unnecessary concern . 
human mobility is limited , and the turkish workers would probably the right to move freely in the european union after a long period of transition , perhaps not until 2025 . 
given the strong growth expected of the turkish economy and declining birth rates , experts estimate that there would be about 2,7 million immigrants . 
meanwhile , the reduction and the ageing of the population in most of europe have made immigration indispensable . 
but among the countries of origin likely of migrants , turkey offers the best chance of successful adaptation . 
it is the muslim population of turkey , which is the most emotion . 
many have the feeling that turkey has no place in a european company founded on a culture and christian traditions . 
it also fears that the islamists do a day of turkey a fundamentalist state . 
as unlikely as secularism is strongly rooted in turkey , this risk cannot be completely ruled out . 
but there are in any democracy , where extremist groups could divert the democratic process to achieve their ends . 
the best way to prevent such a disaster is probably to strengthen the democratic system , and for this to anchor turkey firmly in a bloc of countries them as democratic . 
as for the european union , it must decide whether it wants to be a " christian club " closed , or the opposite an open society , strengthened and enriched by its cultural and religious diversity . 
turkey 's accession would provide a strong response , with particular resonance in the muslim world . 
the need to challenge the arguments against turkey 's membership of the fact that its benefits are rarely mentioned : a single geopolitical position at the crossroads of the balkans , the south caucasus , central asia and the middle east - regions of vital importance for the security of europe - ; a transit country for energy supply ; of military capabilities , at a time when the eu is in the process of putting its new european defence policy ; and a strong economic potential , with a workforce with the young and dynamic . 
at the same time , we must take into account the risks of rejection of turkey : the likelihood of failure of the reform process , which would encourage the extremist movements and would cause instability and political unrest at the gates of the eu . 
turkey 's entry into the european union opens up broad prospects and comes challenges to overcome . 
but the prospects are far superior . 
the game of democracy 
in calcutta , when a younger kid came along and insisted to take part in the game played my friends , we let it go , but only after having chuchot√© in the ear of the other words 
when we were children , it was important to control the cruel art of 
the technique of 
this applies to children and adults also applies to international institutions . 
indeed , the organisations are officially committed to involve all nations in their decisions are often controlled by small groups of powerful nations , while others are only make a mockery of participation . 
the world trade organisation ( wto ) , supposedly based on the principle of a country a vote , sees in reality its agenda programmed in the wings by a small group of nations . 
it is now common for the international organisations which publish a report all involve " stakeholders " and reflect their views . 
the report is then evolutionary generally presented on a web site and all without exception ( ngos , unions and other civil society organisations ) are invited to make suggestions . 
this promotes a sense of participation , but as a friend , paid in these matters , has taught me , the secret is to finally ignore all the comments received and in drafting the report as if there was no website and as if any participation had been recorded . 
increasingly , the free expression of opinion influence or control the behaviour of the government . 
take the united states . 
americans have voiced their opinion freely , in newspapers , on television , in the discussion forums on the internet , on the war planned to george bush in iraq . 
never before was there so much opposition to a war 
what happened , or rather what has not happened , is admirable : almost no effort has been undertaken to muzzle the criticism of the government , as is the case in china and in several countries dictatorial . 
but the largest democracies in the world , the united states , india , the uk , etc . , are more adept at banning the opinions freely expressed aimed to restrict the actions of the government . 
the war in iraq is perhaps the best evidence . 
leave aside the immorality of the war , and god knows how it is immoral ! i wish to draw attention to this growing ability and on the tendency of democracies to " deal " with ( therefore neutralise ) public opinion . 
they have adopted the strategy of the 
when the mature democracies , they become more than ever paid out in the management of opinion and , in most cases , in shaping opinion . 
every comment by hans blix on un inspections he led in iraq , members of the bush administration paraphrasaient what blix said . 
that paraphrase subtly alter of the comments of blix in order to support the arguments of america in favour of the war . 
by repeating the comments retouched , the bush administration hoped that public opinion would agree with the war . 
it can be difficult to reverse a regime totalitariste and to hold elections , but the toughest job is to transform the votes of the voters in a true democracy . 
for individuals used to living in a totalitarian state , this is not easy to learn the meaning of the term " participation . " 
hence the popular belief that democracies , as wine , improve over age . 
although this may be true , the maturity has its own disadvantage . 
while citizens of a democracy continually learn to participate , democratic governments continually learn to reach their goals despite the participation . 
there is no denying that the civic participation all too often serves only to legitimise pretence . 
we need to recognize and deal with this problem in order to prevent the established democracies of atrophy and in order to help the new democracies to become more efficient . 
because it is not only morally wrong to leave of nations and communities feel marginalised and without voice ; it is the best way to frustration , rage and terrorism . 
redistribution of governance in asia 
the governance ( the way decisions that affect the public interest are made ) has become a key factor for determining the pace of development of a country . a successful governance leads changes resolved . 
the failures are punished by the malaise , the discontent and stagnation . 
on 18 april will be held in bangkok a conference to discuss the prospects for improving governance in asia . 
asian policymakers today must face an environment far different from that of their predecessors fifty years earlier . 
the asian population has more than doubled since 1950 , mainly in the poorest countries . 
the political system in these countries was adapted for the populations of little importance , stable and rural . 
today , these companies must also manage urban centres extended that talent and multiple applications from the urban populations . 
the world economy has also changed radically . 
the increase in the flow of goods , capital and knowledge in the world means that the foreign organisations and individuals have a greater influence , further complicating the task of national governments concerned by the internal management of their own nations . 
thus , the international institutions such as the wto have changed frames of reference within which economic decisions are taken . 
the changes in the local economies are also radicals . 
in some parts of asia , the levels of life soared . 
foreign investment own external to the regions , or even have damaged the structure of the domestic economies . 
the old models of economic growth , however , such as the orientation of exports or the selective use of import restrictions that produced satisfactory results in east asia in the last century , are less well adapted to the new laws of international exchange . 
so we need to create new rules of the game . 
in most asian countries , the official rules must be simplified and applied more fairly . 
an approach " to return to sources " is essential in three related areas in which the national governments must take the direction : the reduction of corruption , the strengthening of property rights and the consistent application of legal principles . 
few countries can score points in these areas . 
the close links between the business world and governments have been accused of being responsible for the financial crises that have hit south-east asia in 1997 . 
in some parts of south asia , violent conflicts and the power of the interests in place have endangered the legal principles . 
the result of such failures is that the elites flourish while the mass suffers . 
a clear structure of formal rules remains the best antidote to these failures because they reinforce the informal habits for both companies . 
the cases will not lead to court but in the meetings where the confidence and reputation are key elements . 
as demonstrated by robert putnam , the social theorist , " social capital " ( the networks , the standards and social trust which facilitate cooperation and coordination to the benefit of all ) is as much a factor as a result of economic growth . 
given the power to all members of civil society as possible door to instill more surely specific goals in the efforts to move the nations . 
the government , the private sector and civil society all have a role to play in the strengthening of social capital . 
but successful interactions between these sectors simply cannot be sought , without any input and it is essential that the role of everyone must clearly defined . 
number of asian governments recognize the need to redefine their role more clearly . 
following the 1997 crisis , governments have taken out a little more of the markets , recognising the limits of their capacity to act and how it is important to let private entrepreneurship develop . 
however , governments have a role to play in the promotion of a favourable environment in which the markets can operate . 
the control regulations and enforcement are two important ways but different work ( say through mixed partnerships between the public and the private sector ) which are increasingly included in many asian economies innovative . 
the valuable role of civil society in the expression of community views that governments cannot achieve is also acknowledged , but his relationship to the government and the business world is characterised more often by the conflict that cooperation . 
the role of the private sector in the decision-making process , too , must often be clarified : where the companies are too influential , compared to governments , their needs to operate benefit can lead to policies promoting the elites rather than the masses . 
the metaphor of the game ( with its rules and its participants ) leads some to think in terms of international competition . 
it is not very good since our interdependent world is not a zero-sum game , where the gains of a nation represent the loss of another . 
in fact , the nations are not engaged in a competition the opponent each other as is the case for companies . 
the trade represents a positive sum game where all countries benefit from the exploitation of their areas of comparative advantage . 
good governance can improve this positive sum game and ensure that companies and individuals from these countries participate in profits . 
it is in some way of thinking to governments as well as to entities entering into competition ( providing a better service to their people that other governments ) . 
what makes an important role in international comparisons of systems . 
in this spirit , the conference of the unctad-undp this month ( " governance in asia : underpinning competitiveness in a global economy , " the governance in asia : consolidate competitiveness in the global economy ) , will bring together policymakers from across asia to discuss the challenges facing the governance must face in asia . 
the role of government ( the only player to have the legitimacy of a popular mandate ) is fundamentally important in the direction of a nation going forward . 
the private sector and civil society are , of course , increasingly important partners for governments . 
the functioning of relations between these participants deeply will influence the future of development in asia . 
the 18 brumaire of arnold schwarzenegger 
replace a governor that they had re-elected barely a year earlier by arnold schwarzenegger must have given to the californian voters an enormous pleasure , although tinged with guilt . 
some members of the opposition in germany would dearly love to do the same with chancellor gerhard schr√∂der , although they have not ( yet ! 
) found of film star to replace him . 
several other european governments also know a certain unpopularity shortly after their election . 
this situation is also true in non-eu countries , such as the recently acclaimed , brazilian president luis inacio " lula " da silva , not to mention the south korean president to roh moo-hyun , who has called for a referendum to stop the decline in his popularity . 
it would seem that these days , the effects of the electoral success quickly fade . 
each country must therefore adopt a call-back procedure to preserve the legitimacy of the governments ? 
absolutely not . 
democracy , to borrow the terms of the philosopher karl popper , is defined by the ability to remove those who are in power without violence ; it is now , according to this definition , a method by trial and error . 
but the leaders must be given the chance to govern . 
in fact , they have to have a chance of making mistakes , as long as their decisions do not affect the foundations of the democratic order itself . 
the method by trial and error involves the possibility of being wrong before try again . 
the first mistake of californian voters is " the attractiveness of the immediate future , " which is not surprising in a state where the immediate satisfaction is supposedly a fundamental value . 
but this appears to be damning sometimes in the post-modern democracies of all the countries of the world . 
indeed , democracy today has adopted a pop culture of fads which disappear as fast as they came ; the pop group the hysterical fans today will be forgotten tomorrow and there are plenty of others that are waiting in the wings . 
in politics , this situation can be dangerous because it encourages speedy decisions , whatever their importance , according to popular opinion that prevails temporarily . 
the call for an increased number of referendums reflects and fuels this trend . 
the referendums are , for the most part , the snapshots . 
switzerland , with its generally slower and its in-depth political debate before the elections , is probably the only exception to this rule . 
in general , the referendums use to measure the popularity of political leaders at a given time , whatever the problem at stake . 
if and when britain will decide on the adoption of the euro , it is more likely that the outcome of this vote we learn all sorts of things on tony blair and on the european union , but very little on the merits of the common currency . 
thus , the arguments in favour of representative government is not negligible . 
democracy is to govern organising debates , taking important decisions after in-depth deliberations which , at least in the big country , must be conducted in a parliament of elected representatives . 
the parliaments wish sometimes act quickly , and they may be forced to do so , but , in general , they take enough time to examine the issues in the detail . 
the parliaments speak before form conclusions , where their name . 
take the case of germany , a country in which some leaders of the group of christians opposition democrats burn of desire to reduce the government schr√∂der . 
obviously , the proposed reforms and already partly enacted by the government are unpopular and there is little doubt that a year after his re-election , the coalition of social democrats and the greens did very little chance to convince the polls . 
but who can know what the voters will think in three years ago , when the government 's mandate will end ? 
by the next election , voters , with hindsight , could realise that there was no real alternative to the policies of schr√∂der and it may even be expected that the beneficial effects of these painful reforms their become apparent . 
the leaders need time to take and apply both unpopular decisions that popular . 
they need courage to lead to parliamentary majorities precarious often on the road to popularity with ups and downs . 
that is why they are forced to take the measures the more painful during their first year in office , and then radoucir to the approach of the next election . 
the partnership precarious of prime minister tony blair and the finance minister gordon brown perfectly illustrates this kind of tactic . 
the leaders who will never their popularity are not worthy of their position . 
california has also demonstrated the bad example and californians will probably have to pay a high price for their mistake . 
it will , however , probably not as high as paid by france a century and a half ago , when louis napoleon , elected by universal suffrage , was transformed , through a referendum excessively popular , by napoleon iii , this vote is the last in france until the end of the second empire . 
californians , of course , will not be deprived of the right to vote , but their stubbornness may generate a form unpredictable and irresponsible of state policy . 
it is certain that democracy implies a limited duration in the time during which the powerful of this world must be able to exercise their power without dissent . 
a functioning democracy must give them enough time to win the accession of elected representatives to legislate and to apply their programme . 
these two imperatives are inherently contradictory , but a representative parliamentary democracy is still the best way to ensure the balance between the two . 
anything else would be as stable as the ten best pop songs this week . 
herbert hoover and the stability pact 
in mid-july , the good and great finance ministers of the member countries of the european monetary union ( emu ) met to discuss the economic situation of the euro zone . 
they ruminated over the most recent economic forecast , which projects annual gdp growth in the eurozone this year at a pathetically anemic 0,7 % . 
then , with the exception of one minister , they have all decided that their economy was to suffer a little of this obscenity or worse . 
they have reaffirmed their commitment to the stability and growth pact , which requires countries of the eurozone tax increases and cuts in public spending , increasing the pressure on their economy . 
this pact is already pushing germany to the recession , the italian government debate to revise its growth forecasts quickly enough not to be overtaken by an index of production failing . 
however , this does not seem enough to force the official to review their priorities . 
some european finance ministers still consider the stability pact as the " cornerstone " of emu . 
others talk of the importance of obey the " rules of the game . " 
still others argue that recovery must be done " in the spirit of the pact , " even if it remains essential to restore economic growth . 
view of the other side of the atlantic , all of these reasons seem extremely strange . 
the last time that the us government has tried to ensure a balanced budget despite the recession , it was 70 years , under herbert hoover 's presidency at the beginning of the great depression . 
since a broad consensus has established in the united states on the cycles of economic depression which require the use of fiscal deficits to relieve the suffering , stimulate demand general and rush the recovery . 
economists call these cycles of tax driven " automatic stabilisers . " 
when household incomes are falling , the same is true of the income of the public sector . 
tax cuts can increase the disposable income . 
but , mainly , when household incomes fall , the government 's social spending increase , triggering the recovery in demand , production , investment and employment . 
the lower taxes and increasing spending broaden the budget deficit but soundly and effective . 
the american side of the atlantic , the usefulness of these fiscal stabilisers is not in question . 
on the contrary , every threat of recession , the political debate revolves around their strengthening by pulses 
not more than it is a question of fiscal discipline . 
every time that proposals to amend the constitution to balance the budget have surfaced , the proposals have always offered exceptions not only in the event of war but also in the event of a recession . 
we know the origins of the stability and growth pact . 
the countries of northern europe , particularly germany and the netherlands , have always keen to maintain a report low between their debt and their gdp and interest rates relatively low . 
when these countries have found that the southern european countries , italy and greece especially , had usual a report high between their debt and their gdp and nominal interest rate quite high because of their tolerance visible against inflation . 
the countries of northern europe feared that the deficits of the south can create finally pressure on the partial monetarisation their debt through inflation of the euro , or more precisely , their leaders feared that investors scared for the same reasons demand higher interest rates . 
the stability and growth pact was intended to keep the debt of the countries of the southern europe to low levels , thus keeping interest rates low enough to reassure investors about the fact that the national debt would never be allowed to rise to the point of generating inflationary pressure serious . 
yet if you look at the economic problems of the euro zone today , the threat of the nominal interest rate high in the long term is certainly not part of the ten major concerns of investors . 
at worst , investors do not fear that a high debt governments to slow inflation in actionnant the printing press . 
the problems of the european union come from an index of production stagnated , high structural unemployment , weak growth in productivity , a common agricultural policy unnecessary and unfair and the forecast structural adjustments to the expansion of the european union itself . 
to a certain point of view , it is good that the euro zone finance ministers are ready to maintain their national debt to the lowest in the long term : this is a sign that the victories on inflation won in the 1970s will not be purely and simply ignored . 
but it is dangerous to fixated on the past . 
there is no safer road towards economic disaster than those of historical blinkers . 
as in show herbert hoover , when you consider that the economic problems of the previous generation , we may not see the dangers that are directly in front of our eyes . 
the ghosts of past our economy 
in the famous novel by charles dickens , " a christmas carol " ( " a christmas song " ) , ebeneezer scrooge , a businessman without a soul , is harassed by the spirit of christmas past . 
today , economists are similarly disturbed by ghosts undesirable , when they think about the resurgence of economic ills that were believed to be dead and buried a long time ago . 
whether stephen roach of morgan stanley or paul krugman of princeton , the governors of the american federal reserve or anyone else in japan , the economists in the world are concerned about deflation . 
their concerns date back the thread of economic thought of fifty years ago , a time when economists had discovered that the only thing to do against deflation was to avoid it like the plague ! 
in 1933 , irving fisher --le predecessor of milton friedman , the head of the school monetarist am√©ricaine-- announced that governments could prevent deep depressions in avoiding deflation . 
deflation --le steady decline and continuous prix-- of businesses and consumers to reduce their spending and hoard cash . 
this reduces the ability of shops and banks to repay their debts and can trigger a series of bankruptcies enormous destroying confidence in the financial system , which then feeds the fear and herding . 
such encouragement to accumulate rather than to spend maintain the request to the lowest , and always downwards while unemployment grows and grows over a period of time very long that even politicians and economists who defend hard the policies of laissez-faire cannot accept . 
so , is that the keynesian solution : using the monetary policies ( lower interest rates ) and fiscal ( inflation of public spending and tax reduction ) to keep the economy away from the abyss that makes deflation as possible . 
however , if this issue was settled over fifty years earlier , why tantamount to haunt us ? 
why it represents a threat that worried both japan today and is worrying the united states ? 
at the end of the 1940s , those who pr√©sid√®rent to the creation of an international economic order of post-war tried to create an international monetary system that ( a ) would stabilise sufficiently exchange rates for producers and consumers outside the dangers of excessive fluctuations and irrational of exchange rates , ( b ) would allow nations to develop their own macroeconomic policies and ( c ) will report the catastrophic panics which not only affect the banks and the individuals , but also the entire nations who produced the international financial crisis destructive of the great depression . 
this result in the creation of the bretton-wood system , where the exchange rates are fixed but adjusted , which became over the years the floating system of the 1980s . 
then came the 1990s . 
suddenly , the financial crises incredibly destructive r√©apparurent following the popular panic in mexico , thailand , korea , brazil , etc . , and looked like the american financial panic of 1873 or the crisis creditanstalt austrian in 1931 . 
argentina 's crisis at the end of 2001 looked extraordinary way to argentina 's baring brothers crisis of in 1890 -- if it is not that politicians and international bankers seemed to have a much better idea of what to do to minimize the damage that they do not seem to be today . 
so , if those who b√¢tirent the international monetary system of post-war worked to put in place safeguards to protect us of the dangers of the international financial crisis created by the popular panics , why this kind of crisis rena√Æt-il today ? 
the truth is that the economic policies familiar with a series of disasters possible , confuse anyone who seems most threatening for anyone who seems most away . 
in the united states , the bush administration remains skeptical of the stimulative power of monetary policy and wants big fiscal deficits to reduce unemployment , hoping that the future dangers posed by persistent deficits -- low investment , slow growth , loss of confidence , and uncontrollable inflation rate depreciation change-- can be finessed , or will not be visible until after the departure of the bush team of the presidency . 
in europe , the european central bank believes that the danger of a uncontrolled inflation following a loss of public confidence in its commitment to low inflation outweighs the cost of unemployment , which is still too high . 
in developing countries , the capital controls to prevent financial crises is seen as an obstacle to the attraction of the necessary capital to industrialisation and as a potential source of corruption since the financial flows spend in one way or another in the hands of the nephew by alliance the deputy minister of finance . 
flexible exchange rates designed to allow markets to indicate the loss of confidence in the currency also put exporters in a competitive situation difficult compared to producers of foreign countries whose prices have been battered by exchange rate little predictable . 
even the substitution of imports , today much criticised , were adopted in the origin by developing countries for good ( and bad ) reasons : the closure " protectionist markets of developed countries during the great depression would have disastrous consequences on the economies of developing countries . 
the ghosts of past our economy back because the lessons of this are still saturated . 
politicians and policymakers put forward their economic approach as " the one and only doctrine " . 
but what they do , in fact , is to manage the most important issues of the day at the expense of the disappearance of institutions and policies put in place by their predecessors to control of the problems they received as the more urgent . 
the visitors night ebeneezer scrooge were able to convince him that it was wrong and to open our eyes on his mistakes . 
hope that economists today will also the lesson of their ghosts undesirable .

overcoming the irish cocktail 
justification for humanitarian intervention 
i have visited the former soviet republics of central asia in 1998 to take part in talks on democratic development that has taken place ( or which was due to take place ) in these newly independent countries . 
my hosts were former communist leaders now that assumed the role of presidents elected more or less democratically . 
each of them spoke without constraints of institutions , democratic procedures and respect for the law . 
but human rights were a matter entirely . 
i have presented in each country , a list of political prisoners , asking what was their fate . 
in one country , the president has immediately decided to release a man accused of plotting a coup . 
but even this apparent success was morally ambiguous . 
the president had not taken a political decision : he had given a personal favour . 
i had received a gift , itself just another demonstration of the arbitrary exercise of power of the president , and not a sign of respect for the moral principles . 
in one country , i have discussed with a leader of the opposition islamic fundamentalist , which was launched in a long civil war against the government . 
this man fancied himself president of " committee of national reconciliation " . 
armed guards to the teeth , so that it strongly supported the notion of democratisation . 
indeed , he regarded this notion as the surest way to power because the vast majority of the population thought exactly like him . 
democracy , insinuait-il more worrying , would allow him to " eliminate " ( he did not elaborate on the exact meaning of this term ) the population opposed to his ideas . 
in democracies deprived of democrats , it is even more complicated to discuss " human rights " of procedural formalities because these rights are not considered " rights " in the legal sense , but simply as access of conscience or as gifts in exchange for another valuable asset . 
this distinction is particularly important because it draws attention to the limited effectiveness of official legal standards as a means of promoting human rights . 
this gap between human rights and the behaviour of leaders has led to the most important change ever occurred in the conduct of international affairs of our time : the advent of " humanitarian intervention " . 
this change is initially produced outside the established international institutions and the un system taking its origin of the french group doctors without borders who believed that human rights were a value more important than national sovereignty . 
doctors without borders has introduced the concept of the " law of intervention " in the humanitarian disasters bypassing the restrictions of international law classic . 
the international system has also quickly adopted ( and transformed ) this notion , and several humanitarian interventions 
the nato intervention in kosovo is a precedent which the secretary of state colin powell has used to justify the war with iraq . 
but convincing , if that is the cause of a military humanitarian intervention , such actions should be taken under the aegis of the un charter . 
after all , the promotion of human rights has been the guiding principle of the establishment of the un . 
its task in this area has been declared in the universal declaration of human rights in 1948 and in the helsinki accords of 1975 , which lent human rights legal supremacy on the sovereignty of individual states . 
however , there is a blatant contradiction between the universality and the supremacy of human rights and the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of member states , which are also part of the documents of the un . 
one way to overcome this contradiction is to introduce in the un charter a new chapter dedicated to human rights and to reformulate the chapter iv , which concerns the use of force in international relations . 
the principle of sovereignty must also be redefined itself . 
the world needs a system of legal systems ( bilateral and multilateral agreements , institutions of control and appropriate monitoring ) to regulate the use of force for humanitarian reasons . 
the legal restrictions on humanitarian intervention are necessary because the dictators use it too often to justify a criminal aggression . 
adolf hitler has drawn up its strategy when it has dismantled czechoslovakia , supposedly to defend the sudeten germans , and later when it invaded my homeland , poland . 
as has again demonstrated milosevic in the 1990s , when he was trying to defend the innocent serbs in croatia and bosnia , justify the military intervention solely on the basis of moral principles leaves too much free rein to distort these principles and abuse . 
that is why the debates on the reform of the security council should focus not on the modification of its composition , but on his mission . 
the council must be made explicit responsible for the " safety of man " and its protection , in addition to his current role of safeguarding of more traditional notions of international security . 
the principle of not intervening in the internal affairs of a state has never been absolute and globalisation presents this principle with a challenge radical . 
the term " international relations " assume an order westphalien commitments among of sovereign nations , which has replaced the medieval order of communities defined by the personal allegiance to a king . 
but the next westphalien today is in decline , and the significance of the state boundaries . 
in this wider context , and uncertain , the need to regulate humanitarian military intervention threat . 
what does america want ? 
when the leaders of the world 's richest nations gather in evian , france , one unasked question the stage : what does america in the world ? 
it may be helpful to highlight the principles and ideas that guide us foreign policy . 
first , the inconsistency is not a vice . 
indeed , in foreign policy , inconsistency is often a virtue . 
i am not talking about principles , but of policy . 
the us does not have a " one size fits all " towards the world . 
what happened in iraq should not be over ‚Äê interpreted as a rigid model of us policy towards the countries which use of weapons of mass destruction , which support terrorism or refuse the freedom to their citizens . 
in iraq , the us used force as a last resort , against a country with a history of aggression , and after a strong international consensus has developed on the actions that iraq needed to do . 
different policies , adapted to local realities , regional , and international , to be implemented to meet the challenges posed by north korea , iran , syria , and many other countries . 
american military forces are an essential element of the bulk of the actions taken by the us on the international stage . 
but the defence policy is only one component of foreign policy . 
all the threats against america 's national interests cannot be solved by military force . 
as the saying goes , for people who only have a hammer , every problem looks like a nail . 
the success in foreign policy , as in carpentry , must rely on the right tools for the job . 
the partnership with other countries plays a vital role at this stage . 
despite all the american power , there is little that the us can do in the world that they could not do better with the active participation of others ( governments , international organisations and non-governmental organisations ) . 
the partnership facilitates solutions to problems that are opposed to purely national responses and means the sharing of the burden . 
america relies on partnerships in the global war against terrorism . foreign governments provide intelligence and law enforcement cooperation ; trading partners ensure the security of shipping containers ; private financial institutions follow track the transfers of funds that support the terrorist networks . 
beyond partnerships , international institutions are valuable assistance , provided they are effectively organized , have realistic mandates and their members are committed to standards and common goals . 
these institutions can and often do advance us national interests . 
indeed , it would be difficult to achieve the critical dimensions of american foreign policy ( trade to non proliferation until the policies on the environment ) without these interests . 
the world trade organisation is a typical example . 
it provides a forum for negotiating new trade liberalization agreements , seek remedies against protectionist and discriminatory policies , and resolve disputes with trading partners . 
but the us must also ensure that existing institutions are adapted to current realities . 
nato , for example , is evolving from a cold war alliance focused solely on europe to one suited to meet the security challenges wherever they occur , such as afghanistan and perhaps in iraq . 
multilateralism is most successful when it is based on a real convergence of interests and values . 
the un and other structures can sometimes be best placed to deal with us foreign policy goals . 
when the un or other organisations are unwilling or unable to move against dire threats , america reserves the right to act in less encompassing alliances or flexible coalitions 
this flexibility is an asset of first importance because of the nature of the challenges that loom on the horizon . 
we ignore the failing states at our peril because anarchy creates an environment conducive to extremist ideologies and can offer a haven for terrorists , criminals and drug traffickers . 
one of our most pressing tasks at the moment is to prevent the implosion of weak states . 
another is to assist countries that have sunk in the violence in order to help them slowly to recover . 
one impulse governing america 's international engagement ( and one of the main sources of its global power ) is its willingness to make the world a better place . 
any us foreign policy must combine interests and values , because the american public always insists that the national targets americans are linked to national ideals . 
the attraction of american leadership abroad is based in part on the attractiveness of political institutions , society and the american culture , and its willingness to defend human rights and democracy . 
at the same time , our efforts to promote democracy in the world serve us interests , thanks to the objective recognition of the fact that democracies settle their differences peacefully . 
the world today is irreconcilable conflict between the main concentrations of world power : europe , russia , china , japan and the united states . 
this line of interest and agreement on the rules of the international order offers a promising foundation for the management of the common challenges we all face . 
our goal should be to create a world in which governments , organizations , and the people will accept arrangements that allow them to achieve their shared interests and that reflect fundamental universal values . 
we all have an interest to live in a world in which force is used as a last resort , where terrorism is considered unacceptable , weapons of mass destruction do not spread and are not used , free trade becomes the norm , citizens enjoy the freedoms , democratic values triumph , and the law replaces firearms . 
creating such an integrated world may be optimistic , even idealistic , but rarely naive . 
the road to the double helix , the structure of dna 
fifty years ago , on april 25 , 1953 , james watson and francis crick published a short letter in the scientific journal 
the second major advance came a few months later , when max perutz discovered a technique to determine the structures of large molecules like myoglobin and haemoglobin . 
since then , x-ray structural analysis of protein molecules has helped us to understand the chemistry of biological reactions . 
both discoveries ( the structure of dna and protein structure ) saw the day in the cavendish laboratory at the university of cambridge . 
so why these two foundation stones of the revolution in biology and medicine that dominated science in the second half of the 20 
the great breakthroughs of 1953 rested on the experimental physics at cambridge since the end of the 19th century . 
this legacy shaped the intellectual environment in which the father-and-son team of william and lawrence bragg and in which lawrence bragg , first as a student and then as a research student , developed in 1912 the ideas that led to x-ray structural analysis . 
although max von laue , walter friedrich and paul knipping had discovered the diffraction of x-rays by crystal , it was lawrence bragg who discovered a way to exploit scientifically . 
the reflection by " bragg planes , " sheets of atoms capable diffract x-rays at specific angles that are determined by the separation between the leaves , enabled the braggs to calculate the exact arrangement of sodium and chloride atoms in a crystal salt . 
william bragg a degree of mathematics at cambridge in 1884 and became professor of physics in adelaide , australia. in 1909 he returned . 
in 1909 , he came back to england to occupy a pulpit in leeds , while pursuing his work on the nature of the x-ray 
he became director of the royal institution in london in 1923 , where he drew some young scholars outside interested hand in hand with the rays x. 
among them were two new graduates of cambridge , william astbury had and john desmond bernal , who int√©ress√®rent the problem of protein structure , astbury had result at the request of bragg him provide x-ray patterns of wool and silk . 
bernal moved back to cambridge as a professor of structural crystallography in 1927 and was promoted to assistant director of research in crystallography , at this time a sub-department of the cavendish laboratory . 
bernal looked at first to the atomic structure of crystal , metals and minerals , then of hormones and sterols , and some amino acids , the building blocks of proteins . 
astbury , meanwhile , moved to leeds in 1928 , where he also began working on amino acids and proteins . 
describing his unsuccessful attempts to obtain patterns of well-ordered x-ray diffraction crystal from of the protein pepsin , he wondered if bernal could help obtain crystal other proteins . 
a friend of bernal , glenn millikan come visit a laboratory in uppsala , sweden , where researchers had managed to get crystal pepsin size , he brought some of these crystal , still in their liquor , mother , to cambridge . 
bernal and dorothy crowfoot ( later hodgkin ) obtained patterns of dried crystal , as astbury had , with similarly disappointing results . 
but when bernal observed the crystal in a light microscope , he noticed that when the large amount of water in the network of crystal lattice evaporated , they became disordered . 
they repeated the x-ray experiment , but with the crystal surrounded by its liquor , mother and sealed in a glass capillary , obtaining patterns with of crystalline reflections . 
the results of this first defining moment in protein crystallography were published in the form of a letter in the magazine 
max perutz , a chemistry graduate from vienna , arrived in cambridge in 1935 to work as a graduate student with bernal . 
the following year , he got excellent crystal of haemoglobin and soon produced the best x-ray diffraction patterns to this day . 
but the observable diffraction pattern ( the intensity and the positions of individual reflections ) represents only half of the data needed to deduct the structure of the diffracting object . 
in mathematical terms , it gives the magnitude , but not the phases ( namely , the stages of a oscillatory motion ‚Äí without which it is impossible to determine the atomic positions . 
with simpler structures made up of a smaller number of atoms , chemistry could provide essential information on the atomic arrangements , and a solution could be found by trial and error . 
but the proteins , which contain thousands of atoms , were far too complicated for this to work . 
so , despite the enormous amount of excellent data collected , the solution remained tantalizingly out of reach . 
but the faith in obtaining detailed information about protein structure from x-ray patterns in some way , but only if it could be discovered . 
it was only natural that where the chemistry had failed , physics , and his first laboratory , shows the route , a path by watson and crick in the epic breakthrough that we celebrate this month . 
separate rooms 
the macroeconomic policies , financial globalization , and the evolution of the labor market institutions have exacerbated the inequalities in recent years , not only in income and wealth , but also in access to education , health , social protection , as well as in political participation and influence . 
even in countries experiencing rapid economic growth , a whole set of factors , exacerbated by tremendous demographic changes , has led to the transmission inequality of knowledge , social responsibilities and opportunities from one generation to another . 
as shown by the united nations with the report on the social situation in the world , 2005 : the crisis of inequality , few countries , rich or poor , have proved immune to the global trend of rising inequality , or its consequences on education , health and social welfare . 
of course , there is no simple causal relationship between poverty and inequality to violence . 
but the inequalities and a sense of deprivation contribute to resentment and social instability , and threaten security . 
excluded and that future prospects , young people , in particular , often experience a certain anomie and take refuge in antisocial behaviour , and even violent . 
nor is there a simple explanation on the causes of poverty . 
it is clear , however , that poverty has various complex conditions , and its improvement requires a multidimensional approach . 
it is difficult to imagine , for example , how " refer poverty in the dustbin of history " ( make poverty history ) without also generating enough to work , educational opportunities , and healthcare for all . 
it is certain that the world has seen some progress in several areas in recent decades . 
access to education for girls has improved , and some differences due to the gap between the sexes have been reduced . 
despite aids and the resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis , life expectancy has increased almost everywhere in the world thanks to improving public health systems . 
on the whole , however , the inequality gaps are deep , and in some cases it is growing . 
the most important determinant of income inequality today is wealth inequality , with the increased concentration of ownership of the goods in recent years as the main responsible for greater income inequality in most countries . 
meanwhile , growing unemployment , gap of qualifications and productivity , as well as the " jobless " and the " informalization " or " casualization " employment markets have exacerbated income inequalities in the world , the number of " working poor " and the impact of the " growth in the number of without work " have increased . 
no more than the stabilisation programmes and structural adjustment , imposed since the 1980s , really does not have fulfilled their promises of economic growth higher . 
the growth almost everywhere in the world over the past 25 years has been lower than in the previous 25 years , despite the massive growth in east asia , india , and a few other countries . 
such growth differences suggest that overall global inequality may not have increased unequivocally . 
but the inequalities at the national level have deepened in most countries in recent years , largely due to economic liberalization at both the national and international levels . 
indeed , in many parts of the world , this kind of economic reforms have actually undermined growth rates as well as the progressive role of governments , while otherwise increasing overall inequalities . 
the few exceptions are usually due to continued or new progressive government interventions . 
but they are exceptions : the cumulative impact of these reforms over the past 25 years has produced greater inequality in most developed and developing countries , with rising unemployment , greater income disparities , the reduction of social welfare and environmental degradation . 
the liberalisation of the international financial sector , for example , has undermined the use of more inclusive and better targeted to promote the economic activities . 
in addition , contrary to the promises of his supporters , financial liberalization has actually resulted in net capital flows from those who had the least to those who had the most in the long term , while increasing financial volatility and weakening economic activity . 
meanwhile , negotiations on trade liberalisation seemed to ignore historical trends . 
the conditions of international trade of developing countries have worsened : the price of commodities have declined in relation to manufactured products , just as the prices of tropical agricultural products compared to the price of agricultural products from countries tempered , and prices of generic products fell as a result of the production protected by laws on intellectual property . 
this fact , trade liberalization of manufactured products has resulted in de-industrialization and a sharp rise in unemployment in most regions of the world , as in the case of textiles this year . 
and , while the liberalisation of agricultural trade could improve export earnings for some poor countries , the main beneficiaries will be the richest agricultural exporters . 
the countries that import products currently subsidised will suffer . 
the " retreat of the state " in a large part of the world developed lately has generally involved the reduction of the role of the state , especially in his ability to lead and to support development , as well as its social interventions in the areas of public education , health , housing and public services . 
economic liberalisation put in place in many countries over the past 25 years , was a flawed policy from the start , and its consequences have become glaringly obvious . 
if the world does not focus on economic policies to address the negative impact of economic inequality on the reduction of growth and poverty , the poor and the privileged will continue to live in separate rooms . 
we must not follow the federal reserve 
the us federal reserve faces a dilemma , because it must continue to raise rates compared to an economy devastated by hurricane katrina . 
the fed 's failure to raise rates earlier and gives a lesson to the european central bank : after a prolonged period of monetary stability to unusually low interest rates , waiting too long to raise rates to more normal levels and appropriate includes dangerous consequences . 
the fed was time to start the process of normalisation of rates and it is now paying the price . 
the ecb must not make the same mistake , even if you consider that the two central banks operate in different circles and with different constraints . 
the signs of impending inflation abound across the euro area . 
the growth of the money supply is well above target levels for some time , which indicates excess liquidity . 
september headline inflation , at 2,6 % , is higher than the target of 2 % of the ecb , as is the latest forecasts for inflation in 2006 ( updated forecasts will be published at the beginning of december ) . 
" the period of wage moderation may be coming to an end , " warns otmar issing , the ecb 's chief economist , implying that energy prices soaring may now be feeding through into the overall price level ( also called side effects ) . 
in these circumstances , there is no good reason to wait to raise interest rates . 
more energy prices remain at their high levels of today , the greater the probability that the anticipation of inflation will increase , and that second-round effects will materialize . 
any procrastination on the normalisation of interest rates on the part of the ecb could well lead to a nasty bout of inflation . 
this would be disastrous for europe and the economic recovery since the ecb would have no choice but to slam down hard on the monetary brakes . 
nobody has really want . 
better an increase on the basis of 50 points now , thereby allowing the economic recovery to continue by keeping inflation , that an increase three or four times higher than the figure later . 
the old adage " prevention is better than cure " applies particularly in the case of monetary policy . 
judging by the outcome of last month 's meeting of the ecb governing council , this " prevention " seems close to major not for the eurozone economy . 
indeed , the pace of ecb warnings about the risks of inflation has accelerated in recent months , and what was a " let us be vigilant " became " we are very vigilant " in september , before turning into " vigilance needed about the upside risks to price stability " in october . 
the governing council takes the risk of running out of adjectives , and credibility , if it does not act soon . 
the tone of the comments of the president of the ecb , jean-claude trichet , at the session of questions and answers circa at the press conference following the meeting of october , was particularly hawkish . 
mr trichet appeared to be calling for a pre-emptive approach when he said : " we must not allow the side effects materialise . " 
for the first time , the president of the ecb was ready to admit that the governing council had discussed the pros and cons of a rate hike during their meeting . 
however , current interest rates were described as " still relevant " in october , signaling that the ecb has not yet made the decision to spend . 
it is certain that an unexpected slowdown in economic activity or a strong rise in the value of the euro could postpone the inevitable rate hike . 
what seems clear is that the ecb has used the october press conference to warn politicians , unions and the markets that its long period of inactivity on monetary policy is coming to an end . 
the process is underway . 
this new not everyone is happy with . 
politicians , including jacques chirac in france , silvio berlusconi in italy and ecofin ( the finance ministers of member states of the european union ) , continue to press for fixed , and even lower , interest rates . 
but it is easy for politicians to act irresponsibly when it comes to monetary policy . 
these are not the ones who are singled out when the prices go up , nor were they to repel the genius of inflation in the bottle . 
by constantly pushing for a rate cut more important than what the ecb can offer , politicians are the ecb the scapegoat for europe 's poor economic performance . 
europe is wrong , they say , not the fact of their own failure to carry out the necessary structural reforms , but because the rates are too high . 
at the same time , the ecb does not need to go as far as the federal reserve , which has raised interest rates in increments of 25 basis points at 12 consecutive meetings , and others to come . 
for the ecb , an increase of 50 basis points could be enough at this stage , and rates could then be put on hold for some time . 
the fed waited too long to start the process of normalisation , and this has been more aggressive in lowering rates in the stage of the cycle of falling interest rates , it has had to be more aggressive in raising them in the stage of the increase . 
this is not the type of volatile monetary policy that europe wants or needs . 
the west against the rest of the world ? 
the bombings in madrid have led to the gates of europe the scourge of terrorism . 
march 11 is now the european version of the september 11 , american . 
however america and europe often do not seem to see the world with the same eyes : spain 's response to the terrorist attacks , a threat that affects all democracies , has been to elect a government promising an end to pro-us policy in iraq . 
does this mean that europe and the us have dramatically different visions ? 
the apparent division on foreign policy is partly explained by a misunderstanding about the nature of " europe " . 
the european project is a realist 's response to globalization and its challenges . 
it has been launched to create " solidarity , " promote political stability , and consolidate democracy and the social model of europe . 
having achieved these goals , europe now wants to make a positive contribution to world developments . 
it is not nostalgia for past glory . 
an unprecedented degree of solidarity is now in europe , is apparent in the collective mourning and the outpouring of sympathy towards spain ; we must build on this huge potential to create a sense of solidarity in the world . 
the united states , also victims of a horrendous attack , feel drawn to the world , without going to promote a similar model of cooperation . 
in defending their values and security , americans strive rather to defend the world , especially the western world , dark new threats . 
the messianic idealism that liberated europe of nazism and protected western europe of communism is now directed at other enemies . 
with all the attention focused on strained transatlantic relations , it is easy to forget that our concerns are often . 
on issues such as terrorism , weapons proliferation , iran , afghanistan ( where we jointly train the country 's future army ) and africa ( where french initiatives and american support recently helped to stabilise the ivory coast and the congo ) , europe and the us speak with one voice . 
but on some issues , such as the iraq war , the europeans are not all ready to follow america blindly . 
the world , and europe in particular , has fascination and admiration for the united states . 
but today , we must move away from fascination and gratitude and realize that the pursuit of european integration is in the interest of the united states , who have supported him for 50 years . 
in today 's world , there is enough to make for two to bring about stability and security , and to promote common values . 
in particular , the franco-german " engine " of europe should not be seen as a potential rival to the united states . 
france and germany are not an axis aspiring to become a kind of an alternative leadership to the us . 
rather , the two countries form a laboratory needed to the internal workings of the eu . 
anyone who thinks that we produce a european rival to america has not seen properly at the facts . 
indeed , france and germany do not get along , of course . 
a lot of points separate them : eu enlargement , agriculture and the national market . 
so this is not the 
all of this is that i do not believe in the imminence of a break sustainable . 
most americans still see europe as a partner with largely the same objectives in the world . 
the majority of europeans see in america a strong friend . 
we are all allies of the united states ; our strategy of growth and our contribution to global stability depend on the irreplaceable nature of our relationship with america . 
that is why the us should encourage the development of a policy of european security and defence policy , which is merely the burden sharing that america has imposed on europe for decades . 
we must forge greater european military capacities to put in place a mechanism that allows us to put effectively shoulder to shoulder when terrorism or other disasters strike one of our democracies , as just happen . 
but we also need to create an autonomous european military planning capacity , because the eu might need to carry out its own operations , perhaps because nato is reluctant to this issue . 
we , the french , are opposed to the institution of a " two-speed europe " . 
but we want structured co-operation ( meaning that some european states may lead to the establishment of a defence capability ) because we are not prepared to let the more cautious and more hesitant to the balkan tragedy of the 1990s , when europeans could not act and that the americans would not ( for a time ) . 
the creation of such a capacity will make the eu a more effective transatlantic partner . 
so it is hard for european citizens to understand why the plans for closer european integration are seen as anti-american . 
the only way to remove these fears is to establish closer and more frequent dialogue . 
on the defence and security issues , the eu 's security doctrine provides a great opportunity to consolidate our common worries : terrorism and non-proliferation , but also the need to ensure sustainable development in all regions of the world . 
europe and the us must continue their objectives of cooperation , while ensuring that this cooperation never becomes an alliance of " the west against the rest of the world . " 
some western countries have tried to create a " clash of civilisations " based on our troubled times . 
our task is to find a way to stand together without standing against a particular country . 
india prepared to convert completely its currency ? 
it is very likely that india 's political boldness in seeking peace with pakistan to put an end to their half-century twilight struggle for kashmir may soon be matched by economic initiatives as daring . 
indeed , india is slowly towards a truly bold reform : full international convertibility of the rupee . 
this conversion will affect not only the economic development of india , but will give a lesson for china as it ponders convertibility in the years to come . 
since 1991 , india has oscillated between the depreciation of the rupee and full convertibility , the reserve bank of india ( bis ) relaxing several of foreign-exchange controls . 
resident indians can now have a foreign-currency account and invest in shares of foreign companies , while non-resident indians can repatriate legacy / capital of succession . 
indian companies operating on the foreign exchanges can buy property in foreign countries , and resident firms are entitled to pay external commercial debt up to 100 million dollars . 
the limits placed on the accounts in currencies of exporters are removed , and banks can invest in the capital and money markets overseas . 
india is ready for a convertibility ? 
the government has always behind in terms of domestic economic reforms . 
the structural reforms and privatization have slowed , eroding investor confidence . 
but this inability to address structural problems could expose the economy to external shocks in the long term . 
hence it would be premature for india to open up its capital account immediately . 
exchange rate stability is the key anchor when a country 's reform process has begun . 
however , it remains unlikely that capital account convertibility has a significant impact on the rate of growth of a country . 
with capital-account convertibility , the rupee 's exchange rate will be determined more by capital flows than by inflation differentials , given that india 's inflation rate is more or less to the average of 3 % of the oecd . 
because india is still a shortfall , the rupee could be some pressure following a negative shock . 
although monetary growth is more than double the rate of real gdp growth , the inflationary risk is probably low due to a substantial excess capacity . 
indeed , the 1990s , despite rising output , deflation occurred , which means that india 's potential output develops . 
the steps towards full capital-account convertibility continued in step with impressive growth in foreign currency reserves of india . 
indeed , the liquidity position of india have significantly increased over the last decade . 
following a surplus and an interest-rate differential of 3-4 % , the reserves reached 70,3 billion dollars at the end of 2002 , enough to cover about 15 months of imports , against only $ 4 billion in 1990 . 
following the balance of payments crisis in 1991 , the rupee 's exchange rate has been devalued by 20 % . 
exporters could exchange 30 % of their income to market conditions . 
this method has subsequently been replaced by a system of double the changes , which made the rupee partially convertible ( 60 % of export earnings could be converted at the market exchange rate , and the rest , according to a fixed rate of the rbi used by the government to finance imports of first need such as oil , cooking oil , fertilisers and life-saving drugs ) . 
the two-tier exchange-rate system has acted as an export tax , but he did not survive long , yielding a unified exchange rate on trade . 
full convertibility of the current account followed in august 1994 . 
the policy debate then turned towards capital-account convertibility , strongly encouraged by the imf and world bank . 
in may 1997 , the tarapore committee on capital account convertibility has produced a process of liberalisation in three stages in 1999-2000 , with an emphasis on fiscal consolidation , a target inflation rate , and a strong financial system . 
the east asian currency crisis was then put the action on hold and raised serious questions about the date of the resumption of actions and on the need to proceed . 
the sudden meltdown of apparently healthy economies has a stark reminder that full convertibility external liquidity should not be strong . 
after all , the liberalisation risk of capital-account exchange-rate volatility , and even the country whose liquidity position are important could not prevent a run on their reserves . 
the lesson for india is this : in the event of a domestic or external shock , full convertibility could prove to be a costly , short-lived experiment . 
the fundamental question is whether a convertibility will encourage the revenue or the net capital outflow of funds . 
the risk of greater instability for the rupee is aggravated by serious problems , including a deficit running at 6 % of gdp and the impasse with pakistan . 
short-term capital outflows , likely to occur if one of these two risk worsen , could make it even more unstable the overall efficiency . 
it is therefore vital that india increases the inflow of long-term capital , that the capital account either closed or open . 
in this context , it is remarkable that china , which closed capital account , has foreign-exchange reserves of amounting to 286 billion dollars , which is four times those of india , although china 's economy is that the double that of india . 
full convertibility is not the answer either for attracting foreign direct investment ( fdi ) more important . 
china attracted fdi inflows of 52,7 billions of dollars in 2002 , namely the largest in the world . 
india needs higher fdi inflows to absorb the excess capacity of its economy . 
this situation highlights the importance of a successful management of the capital account ( monitoring inflows and outflows of capital ) to india after a first step towards full convertibility . 
but in the short term , full capital-account convertibility is not in the interests of india . 
the twilight of the chancellor ? 
the resignation of chancellor gerhard schreder the post of president of the social democratic party ( spd ) germany will profoundly affect the distribution of forces within the german government and its low " red-green " majority in parliament . 
although it seems premature to talk about , as some do in germany , " twilight of the chancellor " or to describe the surprising decision to schreder " the beginning of the end " of his post , it is perfectly appropriate to describe it as a dramatic loss of power . 
the immediate winner is franz mentefering , 64 years ago , the spd 's parliamentary floor leader who will succeed , to schreder as president of the party . 
the two politicians will constitute a tandem , but schreder will be more dependent on the loyalty of mentefering that mentefering will depend on the success of schreder . 
schreder represents a platform and a policy programme of moderate left , similar to the philosophy of new labour of the british prime minister tony blair or centrism of former us president bill clinton . 
mentefering , however , is more attached to the traditional values of the social democratic party ( spd ) ( or old labour ) . 
in terms of leadership style , schreder solo plays , mentefering as a team . 
in germany , chancellor holds the strongest position among the main political players . 
the main source of the force of a german chancellor does not , however , lies in the legal powers conferred upon him by the constitution , but the actual support he holds in his own party . 
with one notable exception in the 1950s , none of the two main political parties in germany ( the social democrats and the moderately conservative christian democrats ) has never managed to win an absolute majority in parliament . 
as a result , german chancellors president generally coalition governments and their real authority is based on the loyalty of the party forces they command in these political alliances . 
although the social democrats have never really liked schreder ( they certainly do not love the unforgettable willy brandt ) , they have followed willy-nilly as long as they have seen as the only guarantor of the electoral success after 16 frustrating years ( 1982-1998 ) in opposition to helmut kohl . 
but things have changed . 
since the end of 2002 , schreder and the spd have been facing rates of approval of voters unusually low and this situation is not ready to change situation . 
during the 2003 alone , about 40 000 social democrats have left their party , a haemorrhage without precedent . 
if the national elections had been held last sunday , february 8 , a centre-right coalition consisting of the christian democrats and the liberals would have won 57 % of the vote , according to " infratest dimap , one of the main polling institutes of germany . 
with 35 % of the vote , the coalition green " red " schreder would have ran to his loss . 
at the beginning of what has been dubbed a " super election year " in germany ( 14 elections , one at european level , five at the regional level and eight at the local level ) , it was bad news for the spd . 
several times , schreder had been extremely stimulated by desperate situations when he stood with his back to the wall . 
this quality is its greatest strength , and it seems he has now launched in the counter-offensive the more risky . 
it is based on the bet : economic improvement consistent will happen from the second half of 2004 until the next national elections in autumn 2006 , and the voters will attribute the expected recovery to the reforms to the economy , the labour market and the welfare state , called " agenda 2010 , " that schreder had done the spearhead of his chancellorship . 
for a long time , the reformist rhetoric of schreder has not corresponded to its policy . 
it is only after his re-election in autumn 2002 he has abandoned his former position populist , his answers in the short term and its methods n√©o-corporatistes aimed at convincing the unions and associations of employers . 
given the more pressing problems of germany ( an accelerating demographic decline , a labour market excessively regulated and a cloudy and confusing tax system , the reform programme of schreder may seem far too timid , but many cuts have been perceived as extremely cruel by the constituency of the spd , especially the powerful unions . 
but , given the economic distress of germany , which should get worse following the country 's demographic problems , the social democrats are now condemned to abandon the creation of wealth for the benefit of redistribution . 
germany cannot afford to slow down or , worse still , stop the reform process . 
in the best case , schreder will remain faithful to the " agenda 2010 " philosophy , and mentefering patiently explain to a reluctant spd that they have to cross the desert before reaching the promised land . 
in the worst case , schreder returns to populism to win an election victory in the short term and mentefering will confirm this choice to avoid me to ¬¢ wounded social democratic in total despair . 
the tragedy of schreder is that its power could further erode whatever way he chooses . 
at the end of the present " super election year , " we will know the answer . 
the syndrome of the great man 
in this era of globalisation , vast impersonal forces that are supposed to determine the course of events . 
the globalisation of markets , unfettered trade , militant islam , china 's awakening : these are the things that historians and strategists usually portray as the key forces shaping our destiny . 
yet , for the most part , we do not see things as well . 
most people still instinctively look of " big men " to historical figures , the men ( and women ) who seem to forge events through their political vision , their charisma , and the force of their moral positions . 
by sheer force of conviction and personality , such figures , do we believe , can move things forward , while providing a glimmer of hope in an otherwise detached and impersonal universe . 
this desire to find providential men or women in these times of globalisation has just three factors . 
in a first time , it is the complexity and the vulnerability of our world . 
second , paradoxically , it is our growing cynicism towards politics and politicians . 
finally , it is the result of our media culture , obsessed as it is to put a " face " on the events . 
confronted with the problem of bring positive changes in a domestic or international environment that seems to defy the power of " normal " leaders , one looks for new alexander to untie the " gordian knot " and transcend complexity by sheer force of will and dynamism . 
the structural reforms of europe , for example , are considered impossible to put in place except if they were imposed by a reincarnation of margaret thatcher . 
in the middle east , everyone is waiting for the arrival of a new anwar sadat in the arab world . 
disillusion with politics and politicians also is an important element of our aspirations for a strong leader . 
in france , for example , the commemoration a little too flattering the tenth anniversary of the death of fran√ßois mitterrand primarily reflects widespread disillusion with his successor , jacques chirac . 
indirect criticism of the present is often a key element of an idealized vision of the past . 
the less we expect from a " normal " politician , the more we are looking for a hero . 
the world has become a global stage , the media 's role in fueling the appetite for providential leaders is essential . 
the public requires quick answers to complex problems , which , if they remain unresolved , may endanger the planet . 
it needs figures with whom they can identify , immediately recognize , and , above all , it can pay its confidence . 
the emergence of an embryonic " world civil society " exacerbates the requirement for universal and charismatic figures , holding out the hope of global accountability , with some populist overtones . 
in a world in search of providential leaders , the case of ariel sharon is both symbolic and paradoxical , as this universal man remains one of the most controversial figures of recent decades . 
it has become a nearly revered figure in his country , and western public opinion generally considers that his political defeat represents a potentially fatal blow to any hope of progress in the region , even if it remains hated in many parts of the arab and muslim world . 
sharon 's transformation from villain to hero in the space of a few years , is a source of fascination for his people , the region and the world , especially as its ultimate intentions will remain subject to endless discussions among historians tomorrow and the politicians claiming its faithful heirs today . 
mr sharon it really has been convinced by demographers that " greater israel " that once seemed to be his dream would actually mean the end of the jewish state or his disengagement strategy of " gaza first " really mean " gaza " ? 
for those who support one or other of these interpretations , sharon will forever hold the benefit of the doubt . 
that we have been able to compare the attack suffered mr sharon , in terms of political consequences , for the murder of yitzak rabin demonstrates that combines his personality with hope and security . 
" the bulldozer " became the grandfather of most israelis and the last card of western diplomacy , for americans and , surprisingly , for europeans , too . 
he alone seemed to embody the association of reassuring strength and vision to muster a majority of israelis behind him in a process of unilateral disengagement . 
in fact , one might ask if the world did not sharon a providential man because he wanted so much to believe that there was still a possibility of hope in the middle east . 
was this a futile illusion or self-fulfilling prophecy ? 
we will never know . 
what is certain is that the vacuum created by the departure of mr sharon of political life is all the more striking in the light of the images of chaos that emerges out of gaza since the withdrawal of israel and the collapse of the palestinian authority before our eyes . 
no more so than the emergence of a new providential personality will easily . 
these are not all exceptional periods create their bonaparte , which is probably better , because exceptional leaders may give the illusion that all the problems have their solution , which is far from being true . 
the natural course of history in the most optimistic sense is progress " on the periphery , " but the rapid pace of technological change is pushing us to expect a similar progress in human affairs . 
many of us believe that such an impossible wager can be filled only by a providential man , with all the hopes , and the dangers , that it represents . 
the fall of the un 
the reign of terror of saddam hussein takes its end . 
his government ba' athiste , however , will not only . 
ironically , the united nations will be with him . 
it is possible that the entire un will not disappear . 
the sectors devoted to " good works " ( namely , bureaucracies for the preservation of peace in low risk or those who are fighting against aids and malaria or to defend the rights of the child ) will remain . 
the mill to words arising on the east river in new york will continue to bleat . 
the reluctance of the security council to approve the use of force to enforce its own resolutions on iraq 's possession of weapons of mass destruction was the decades-old fantasy of several decades the un as the foundation of the world order . 
as we sift the remnants of the war to liberate iraq , it is important to preserve , through the international law applied by international institutions , the rubble of the liberal intellectual concept of security in order to better understand . 
while iraqis free describe the nightmare of the rule of saddam , which lasted a quarter of a century , we must not forget what are those who have supported this war and those who have not supported , those who have said that the moral authority of the international community was enshrined in pleas to obtain additional delays for the un inspectors and those who demonstrated against the " regime change " . 
in the spirit of post-war reconciliation that diplomats are always keen to promote , we must not resign ourselves to the timid , blighted notion that world order requires us to balk at rogue states that terrorize their citizens and threaten ours . 
decent , thoughtful and high-minded , the millions who marched against the resolution to ask of auditors to iraq were catalyzed by the idea that only the un security council has the authority to legitimize the use of force . 
a voluntary coalition of liberal democracies willing to put their soldiers in harm 's way is not enough . 
it matters little that these allow troops to apply the requirements of the un . 
if a country or a coalition of countries other than the un security council made use of force , even as a last resort , " anarchy , " and not international law , would prevail , destroying all hope of world order . 
it is believed the demonstrators . 
but this is a dangerously wrong idea and leads inexorably to justify morally ( and even existential politico-military decisions ) to countries like syria , cameroon , angola , russia , china and france . 
if a policy is right when the security council approves , how can it be wrong simply because communist china , russia , france or a multitude of minor dictatorships refuse their approval ? 
those who opposed the actions of the coalition in iraq generally respond that the " next " must have the primacy on " anarchy . " 
but is it true ? 
the un security council it represents the most competent to ensure the next and save us from anarchy ? 
history suggests the opposite . 
the un arose from the ashes of a war that the league of nations was unable to prevent . 
the league was simply not ready to face italy in abyssinia , and even less , if she had survived this debacle , to fight against nazi germany . 
in the euphoria that followed the victory during the second world war , the hope of making the collective security was placed in the hands of the un security council , for poor results . 
during the cold war , the security council was hopelessly paralyzed . 
indeed , the decision to defend south korea against attack in 1950 was taken by the council only because stalin ordered his diplomats to boycott the sessions of the un , which meant that no soviet ambassador was present to exercise its right of veto . 
it was a mistake that the soviets would not make again . 
in 1967 and 1973 , the un withdrew from the middle east , leaving israel defend itself by its own resources . 
the soviet empire was wrestled to the ground and eastern europe liberated , not by the un but by the mother of all coalitions , nato . 
facing milosevic 's multiple aggressions , the un has not managed to stop the balkan wars or even to protect its victims . 
you remember sarajevo ? 
srebrenica and the massacre of thousands of muslims under the supposed protection of the un ? 
it took that countries of good will form a coalition to save bosnia from extinction . 
once the war was over , peace was made in dayton , ohio , and not to the un . 
the rescue of kosovo 's muslims was not the fact of the un : their cause has never received the approval of the security council . 
this century now challenges the hopes of a new world order on new plans . 
we will not defeat or even contain fanatical terror if we do not bring the war in the territories which the trigger . 
we will have to use force against states that harbor terrorists , as we have done to destroy the taliban regime in afghanistan . 
the states most dangerous are those who possess weapons of mass destruction , the chemical , biological , and nuclear weapons that can kill not hundreds or thousands of individuals , but hundreds of thousands . 
iraq was part of these , but there are others . 
the hope to persuade them to withdraw their support or asylum they attach to the terrorists rests on the certainty and efficiency they face . 
the chronic failure of the security council to apply its own resolutions , with regard to iraq , is clear : it is simply not up to the task . 
we therefore remain with coalitions of the countries of goodwill . 
far from disparaging them as a threat to a new world order , we should recognize that they are , by default , the best hope for that order , and the real alternative to the anarchy caused by the dismal failure of the united nations . 
neoliberalism , and then after ? 
twenty years of neoliberal economic policies have yielded disappointing results for developing countries . 
latin america , the region with the most tried to put in place the proceeds of the " washington consensus " ( free market price deregulation , privatisation ) , has been the experience of weak growth and volatile widening inequalities . 
among the former socialist economies of eastern europe and the soviet union , few have reached the real output levels that prevailed before 1990 . 
in sub-saharan africa , most economies failed to respond to the adjustment programs demanded by the imf and world bank . 
the rare examples of success occurred in countries that have followed their own pace and which are not really a false prospectus of neoliberalism . 
china , vietnam and india : all three violated virtually all the rules in the neoliberal guidebook , even when they moved in a geared more to the markets . 
it is now time to abandon neoliberalism and the washington consensus . 
but the challenge is an alternative , a set of policies to promote the development without falling into the trap of a new plan unworkable , supposedly for the well-being of all countries without distinction . 
experience suggests that an adequate growth program must be rooted in two strategies : an investment strategy designed to kick-start growth in the short term and a strategy of implementation of institutions designed to provide an economy with resilience in the face of economic shocks . 
the key to investment strategy is to achieve interest to the local businessmen to the local economy . 
encouraging foreign investment or liberalizing everything and then wait until the situation improves is not viable . 
an effective strategy must achieve two objectives : to encourage investment in non-traditional areas and pruning the projects or investments that fail . 
for this , governments must use both the carrot and the stick . 
find out what a country produces ( or could produce ) easily is the main challenge of economic development . 
the carrot is needed because there is much to win socially if you discover , for example , that cut flowers , the soccer balls , or computer programs can be produced cheaply . also because this knowledge can guide the investments of other entrepreneurs . 
the businessman who made the first " discovery " can capture only a small part of the social value that this knowledge generates , and quickly , it is followed on this path by others . 
as a result , entrepreneurship of this type ( discover what can be produced ) is usually under-supplied in the lack of commercial incentive . 
we must also use the stick to ensure that these incentives do not lock unproductive and wasteful investments . 
the establishment of such a strategy may vary from one country to another , according to the administrative capacity , the prevailing incentive regime , the flexibility of the tax system , the degree of sophistication of the financial sector and the underlying political economy . 
the funding programmes time limited , the funding of public companies and the financing of exports represent some ways to approach for this , but there are many others . 
there is no single instrument will work everywhere . 
governments that do not have the capabilities required to exercise their leading role of the private sector are going right to the disaster and have little chance of improving the allocation of resources . 
this attempt can succeed , but economic growth requires more than the temporary resuscitation of investment and entrepreneurship . 
it also requires effort to build four types of institutions needed to maintain growth momentum and the strengthening of the resistance to shocks : 
the institutions to build the market ( right of ownership and contract law ) 
the institutions of market regulation ( outsourcing , economies of scale , and professional information ) 
the institutions market stabilisation ( monetary and fiscal management ) 
the institutions to legitimise the market ( social protection and insurance ) . 
building and solidifying these institutions , however , takes time . 
enjoy an initial period of growth to experiment and innovate on these fronts can be high dividends in the future . 
the key point here is that institutional arrangements are , by necessity specific to each country . 
find out what works in any one country requires experimentation . 
after all , the institutions are not plants capable of being planted in any soil and climate . 
the reforms that operate in an environment can be weak or faltering in others . 
such specificity helps explain why successful countries ( china , india , south korea and taiwan , among others ) combining unorthodox elements to policies . 
it also explains why large institutional differences persist among the industrialised countries of north america , western europe and japan in areas such as the role of the public sector , the legal system , corporate governance , the financial markets , the labour markets and social protection . 
while economic analysis can help to make institutional choices , public deliberations and the collective choice also have an important role to play . 
in fact , we can think of participatory democracy as m√©ta-institutions which will make a choice in the " menu " of institutional arrangements in each area . 
designing such a growth strategy is both more difficult and more easily than the establishment standard neoliberal policies . 
more difficult because the constraints that it needed to growth are often specific to each country and adapt well to standardized recipes . 
but it is easier because once these constraints , clearly objectiv√©es relatively simple policy changes can yield a lot from an economic point of view and pave the way for a virtual circle of growth and institutional reform . 
adopt this approach does not mean abandoning standard economic thinking , far from it . 
neoliberalism is to neoclassical economics as astrology is to astronomy . 
in both cases , it takes a lot of blind faith to move from one to the other . 
critics of neoliberalism should not oppose the classical economy but only its misuse . 
the other central europe 
a spectre is haunting central europe as its countries prepare to join the european union . 
this promising development is compromised by a fevered electoral nationalism which seeks to win votes by promising to reopen old wounds and settle old scores . 
the most striking example comes from hungary , where prime minister viktor orban has demanded the repeal of the decrees in 1945 by president edvard benes decrees ( which confiscated the assets of german and hungarian populations deported from czechoslovakia to this period and stripped citizenship ) within the framework of a re-election campaign that failed narrowly . 
but orban is not the only one to see an electoral advantage in summoning memories of old ghosts . 
orban has argued that the revocation of the " benes decrees " should be a condition of the integration of the czech republic ( as well as slovakia ) joining the european union . 
the ill will inspired by the manoeuvre to orban has interrupted a large part of the regional cooperation during the last decade . 
instead , an ugly new form of national populism is emerging in the plain that extends between bavaria and the danube . 
the chain reaction of reawakening of nationalism dangerously change the political landscape . 
since the election has led to power the coalition parties of wolfgang sch√ºssel and jorg haider in vienna , austria 's relations with the neighbouring czech republic have deteriorated on two points : the requirement that the czechs are closing the temelin nuclear power plant on the austrian border and rescind the benes decrees in which the sudeten germans have been deported from the czech republic and settled massively in bavaria but also in austria . 
once the nuclear plant issue was resolved , populist pressure was forced into a single path , the request to revoke the benes decrees . 
czech prime minister milos zeman quickly demonstrated that he could also play a demagogic nationalist card . 
he described the sudeten germans as hitler 's " fifth column " and suggested that israel could solve its palestinian problem using the czech method of 1945 : deportation . 
edmund stoiber , the head of the government of bavaria , the candidate of the conservative cdu / csu for german chancellor against current chancellor schroeder , and a staunch advocate of the sudeten germans , demanded that schroeder cancel a scheduled visit to prague in response to zeman 's outburst . 
to defuse an electoral battle with his rival , schroeder agreed . 
the fact that orban has supported the requirements of stoiber was felt as god 's gift to the slovak nationalist vladimir meciar in its new attempt to become prime minister , because it allowed him to argue that his domestic opponents were preparing to bow to pressure from the european union and force slovakia to compensate the hungarians expelled by benes in 1945 . 
meciar pounced , denouncing the " hungarian menace , " cancelling a stroke four years of hard work with the current government of slovakia to include representatives of the ethnic hungarian minority in the government of slovakia . 
the issues relating to the legal order of post-war europe go far beyond the former czechoslovakia . 
erika steinbach , president of the association of deportees ( from the east ) and a member of the cdu of stoiber , argues that the issue of the deportation of german populations affects the poles , czechs , slovaks and slovenes , encompassing a large part of eastern europe and central europe . 
in the 1930s , the b√™te noire of some countries of central europe was " the treaty of versailles . " 
today , it appears that the potsdam declarations of 1945 and who sanctioned the mass expulsion of german populations , are the new enemy . 
the worry now is that this type of demagoguery can lead to a cycle of populist victories . 
this concern was dented when viktor orban 's fidesz party lost in hungary 's recent parliamentary elections , but other politicians happy to demagogue national resentments - vaclav klaus in prague , edmund stoiber in germany , vladimir meciar in slovakia - still see nationalism as a vote-winner despite the defeat of orban . 
given that they are linked to the sceptics who oppose the european union such as berlusconi in italy and austria 's sch√ºssel-haider coalition , the true nature of european politics may turn decidedly unpleasant . 
since its creation , the european union has sought to move beyond the old differences and , through cooperation , to build a better future . 
today , some politicians want to take advantage of the desire to eastern europe to use historical issues to their political advantage . 
such a situation suggests two fatal consequences : first , that there is no better way to turn parts of public opinion of the candidate countries against the european union to allow the local populists to portray the union as an agent of spreading german power . 
a european union extended should represent a means to balance the asymmetrical relationship between small countries of eastern europe and germany . 
it is possible that it is seen as a clue to this asymmetry . 
the second concern is that , as nato and the european union is widening , these ugly debates will infect relations within the international bodies . 
this fear may be one of the reasons why president bush has refused to meet prime minister orban recently , and it is frequently question that if orban spoke as he is now before the entry of hungary in nato , his country 's application would have been rejected . 
what could interrupt this process ? 
after 1945 , western europe is committed painful debates about history , who have contributed to the franco-german reconciliation . 
the notions of " collective guilt " were dismissed as having no foundation in a united and uniting europe . 
president vaclav havel courageously expressed during his first trip to germany in january 1990 , but his comments have been mistaken for weakness . 
has the approach of the expansion of the european union , the mission of europe should not be undermined by the advocates of the idea that politicians of the old " other " central europe , prefer to wallow in the past rather than think responsibly to build a peaceful and prosperous europe . 
bush and blair to resign ? 
the main consequences of the war in iraq will not be on the battlefield . 
they will come later , because they depend on the validity of the arguments put forward by george bush and tony blair to launch an attack against a largely defenseless population . 
these arguments have been debated passionately in the world . 
if they are justified , the war will , perhaps on a safer world . 
but if they are not based or cannot be verified , the war could lead to more instability . 
in this case , not to make the situation worse , the american president , and british prime minister should resign . 
the war was not and could not be justified on the fact that saddam hussein was a tyrant . 
the reasons put forward by bush and blair are linked to the danger posed by saddam 's regime . 
they have cited four arguments : 
iraq has weapons of mass destruction . 
these weapons are a serious threat and immediate . 
the un inspections were not eliminating this threat . 
the war was the best way to end this threat . 
the first argument will be the easiest to verify . 
bush and blair talked repeatedly about stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction and mobile units capable of the produce and use them , as well as ongoing programmes designed to make nuclear weapons . 
they must demonstrate they are moving , and they must do so before an international opinion who think capable of hustle of evidence . 
it is for this reason that independent experts mandated by the un should examine the evidence that could be discovered . 
without real proof of the existence of weapons of mass destruction pose a real threat , bush and blair should leave - this , whatever the result of events in iraq . 
the second argument is more difficult to prove . 
bush and blair must show that the weapons of mass destruction that they have found constituted a grave and urgent threat . 
we know that iraq has owned chemical and biological weapons , because the us sold them to . 
it is therefore not whether it traces of those weapons remain - it must be in the storage sites - but if he remains in sufficient quantities to pose a threat . 
if the iraqis are now using these weapons , it will be proof that they were ready to be used . 
it will then determine whether they could represent a threat to the outside iraq 's borders and to what extent iraq would have employed if the current war had not . 
the third argument is hugely controversial . 
bush and blair should demonstrate that the un inspections were ineffective . 
they can achieve this by showing that the iraqis have managed to hide material in the sites controlled by the inspectors . 
there should be a systematic review of sites already visited . 
and if you find out of weapons of mass destruction in other sites , it will have to explain why the inspectors could not have found if the inspections had continued . 
the fourth argument will be used to envy propaganda on both sides . 
the war justified in terms of costs and results ? and was war really the last resort ? 
to answer these questions , it must objectively assess the cost of the war . it will take into account the loss of lives , the destruction , the appearance of other forms of violence ( terrorism for example ) , as well as the economic impact of the conflict on iraq and geopolitical consequences . 
has this day , bush and blair have failed to convince that part of their own public opinion . 
the american people have been a display ranging from simple patriotism chauvinism in passing by the manipulation of fear and confusion between iraq and the networks of bin laden . 
but all that was not convinced the rest of the world who sees this war with a mixture of defiance and concern . 
it will be different if the four points is mustered . 
when the 13 british colonies of north america launched the war of independence , thomas jefferson has estimated that he had to explain why in the name of " respect the views of humanity " . he has exposed in the declaration of independence . 
such an explanation , based on rigorous evidence , is equally necessary today . 
if the reasons given for war are not confirmed , the consequences are serious . 
the propaganda , the images of iraqis acclamant us and british troops and the astonishment at the precision smart bombs should not disguise a terrible truth : bush and blair shattered peace and organised massacres mischief against the vast majority of world opinion . 
remedy the divisions of the planet demands to strengthen the authority of the un and change of leaders in the united states and in england . 
given the terrible costs , i hope that this war will prove justified . but the evidence known today , i doubt it . 
if it is proved unequivocally that iraq stored weapons of mass destruction ready for use on a serious threat , and that it was unlikely that the un inspectors to detect them , we must acknowledge the arguments made by bush and blair . 
but even in this case , the war was perhaps not the best solution , compared to a policy to contain the danger posed by iraq . 
but in this case , the war will have been worthwhile . 
the idea of a senseless war is almost too frightening to contemplate . 
memory and oversight of zhao ziyang 
so the former chinese leader and communist party general secretary zhao ziyang has died . 
the political choices that he had √©pous√©s in office for a long time : the 19 may 1989 , when he appeared on tiananmen square just before dawn to beg , the tears to the eyes , and apologize to the demonstrators . 
" i am very sorry , " he said to onlookers . 
" i came too late . " 
after that , he has more as an historical chimera that a real person . 
when his bizarre and unscheduled appearance on the place was broadcast on chinese central television the following morning , during one of the last days of media coverage without censure , across china , the public was stunned by this fleeting moment official anguish , and all too human . 
after all , party leaders rarely demonstrate their personal feelings in public , even less transgress the party line as brazenly that zhao did . 
such individualism fit neither leninist nor traditional chinese proscriptions behaviour for a high official . 
while the crackdown following those heady weeks of freedom of expression and assembly came to its apocalyptic end on the night of 3 to 4 june , zhao vanished , swallowed up by the party 's memory hole where so many other leaders have vanished since the socialist " liberation " of china . 
in the shadow of the democratic world , there was almost no head of state to protest in defence of zhao , asking only of auditors on his illegal and immoral incarceration . 
instead , the life of zhao was held in abeyance , under house arrest , conveniently forgotten as a cryogenically frozen celebrity with no hope of resurrection . 
zhao was not killed , but allowed to live in an old beijing courtyard house with his family . 
he was allowed out from time to time , but under guard as an animal curiosities , to go to the bathroom alone or play golf , one of the demonstrations of " bourgeois liberalization " that its reform efforts allowed to enter into china , once hermetic seal . 
the chinese have long since used the deaths of fallen leaders as the opportunity to show their feelings , who can no longer speak through the normal political process . 
during the winter of 1976 , when the leader zhou enlai ( viewed as a liberal in the maoist hierarchy ) died , tens of thousands of people spontaneously flooded tiananmen square , giving the party a beautiful fright . 
this was , of course , the death of the former party chief hu yaobang , a liberal like zhao , which set off the protests of 1989 . 
it is not certain that zhao 's supporters are expressed in the same way . 
the events of 1989 remain very sensitive , and tiananmen square is so well guarded , that it is difficult to imagine that he could soon produce any demonstration . 
at the same time , china seems if clinging to the affairs of our days that it is difficult to imagine the crowds marching to a cause that would do nothing to their bottom line . 
it is as if the communist party had turned marx and replaced religion with profit in the role of the new " opium masses . " 
few people outside the poorer classes of unemployed workers and dispossessed peasants seem to have the taste of political protest . 
by contrast , zhao embodied a chapter in chinese history during which present himself as a reformer meant not only the economy but also all the aspects of daily life . 
before becoming leader and head of the party , he made the experience of many areas such as the collectivisation of agriculture or the separation of the party of business to laws guaranteeing the rights of journalists and greater openness to the outside world for ordinary people . 
he was even the first chinese leader to wear a suit and a tie rather than the maoist dress when it traveling abroad and the first to participate in the press conferences open . 
although zhao was not a visionary , nor a vaclav havel and lech walesa , and not even anti-communist , its programme in the mid-1980s embraced the economic , political , cultural and social media , and it led to one of the richest and most open on an intellectual level of chinese history . 
this was a tragic paradox that the political movement that so peacefully swept china in 1989 ended up arresting the reform process large and evolutionary which zhao had devoted all his life . 
the direction of the party so chastened by the trauma of 4 june that during the years afterwards , it was difficult to determine if the reform would survive . 
then , in 1992 , deng xiaoping set in motion a marketizations of society the fastest and most comprehensive in history , catalyzing china 's spectacular rise as an economic superpower . 
zhao ziyang 's death reminds us not only that it was treated unfairly , but also how much the chinese reforms have been uneven . 
for china 's " miracle " really becomes miraculous , party leaders would do well to study the legacy of a man that they are now eager to push into oblivion . 
the real risks of deficits 
deficits are back , and they want revenge . 
the us government 's budget deficit now stands at $ 455 billion , 4,1 % of gdp . 
two years ago , the us had predicted a budget surplus for many years . 
although marginally less achieved that the united states , other rich countries sink in the budget deficit . 
the european commission believes that the french government deficit will reach 3,7 % of gdp this year , against 3,4 % for germany ; these figures go well beyond the ceiling of the deficit ( 3 % of gdp ) set by the stability and growth pact of the euro zone . 
by running deficit , a country increases its national debt and imposes a burden on future generations . 
politicians naturally prefer to hide the way in which wealth is shifted between the generations . 
their priority is to solve the immediate problems and today 's promised benefits . 
the accountants who compute government deficits are trying to prevent politicians from fooling us into accepting the benefits they offer without understanding what will be the future cost . 
but these accountants do not provide is a way to know when deficits are justifiable and when they are not . 
deficits raise not only immediate political issues , but also issues of distributive justice between the generations and intergenerational risk sharing . 
no generation should be forced to accept unnecessary economic risks imposed by another generation . 
the possibility that the deficits treat future generations properly depends on how are designed the systems of taxation and spending from a government . 
the supporters running deficits often portray them as a necessary evil to restore an economy in which confidence crumbles . 
following keynes , they argue that running deficits will restore confidence before a recession or depression . 
but this is in fact a patient on prozac before he becomes suicidal . 
such arguments , although they are entirely legitimate at times , have limits . 
japan 's public deficits spawned a national debt of 140 % of annual gdp , without producing any economic resurgence . 
indeed , current budget deficits reflect long-term problems that are not what keynesian theory envisions . 
the debates on deficits must be recast in terms of important intergenerational issues in the long term . 
the problems are subtle , because they depend on the actions of governments to come . 
in the past , some governments , when they were facing huge national debts , effectively " inflated them away . " 
they have removed the burden on the next generation that is actually returned to investors who have not withdrawn from the market obligations on the first signs of rising prices , or who have delayed the purchase of a house when inflation would have wiped out the real value of their mortgage debt . 
governments could decide to act this way again , especially if national debts believe more . 
the resurgence of substantial inflation may seem unthinkable in the current environment , but do not forget that even a 6 % annual inflation rate is relatively modest the real value of debt of a nation in a little over 6 and a half years . 
it is possible that continued public opposition to a gradual increase in inflation is not guaranteed . 
some politicians may succeed again to entrench the idea that inflation , being stimulative , is good for the economy . 
but in addition to the officially measured government deficits , there is also some looming obligations caused by a demographic change ( declining birth rates ) and with the prospect of considerable sums of payments for social security benefits in the future . 
the scope of these obligations is monumental . 
in their 2003 report , the trustees of the us social security administration trust funds estimate that maintaining the solvency of the social security system for the next 75 years will cost 3,5 trillion , or about the amount of today 's total us government debt ( 3,9 trillion ) . 
the administrators of the us medicare trust funds ( providing medical services to the retired ) estimate that their unfunded obligations are now 5,9 trillion , more than half of the national debt official of america . 
the possibility of budgetary shortfall in social security and health care is much worse in europe and japan because of demographic statistics far more difficult . 
moreover , unlike official national debt , social-welfare obligations are not linked to the currency . 
instead , they are the promise of a certain standard of living ( including the value of medical services ) , adjusted for inflation . 
no government can thus " cave in " . 
but this does not mean that pensions and other social obligations are entirely fixed . 
this means that the problem is political . 
pensioners are among the most powerful lobbies in a democracy , and politicians are loath to confront them on an issue if essential . 
still , we need to face firmly to the intergenerational issues at the heart of the economic dilemmas . 
our pension systems and our national budgets must be based on a " generational accounting " which ensures that the economic risk is systematically divided between the generations . 
this means that pension and tax institutions must be designed to take more account of the changing circumstances facing different generations , rather than make fixed promises , which will certainly not be held in any way , some recovery in the future . 
for example , when demographic trends or constant economic hardships impose burdens on the workers at the level of social benefits , the benefits to pensioners should be automatically modified by the increase in the retirement age and / or adjusting benefits . 
these adjustments will probably in the coming decades , but only after a long lag and with several injustices . 
we need a system right from the start in order to be able to manage the risks which cover several generations of rational way . 
these problems can be resolved today , as the economic slowdown in most advanced countries makes most politicians focus on the results in the short term ? 
difficult periods , like the great depression , have helped to introduce changes decisive . 
under effective leadership ( which unfortunately seems default ) , today 's milder hardships could lead a public discussion on the most appropriate methods of intergenerational risk sharing . 
say no to bush 
for three years that the american president pursues a unilateral programme , refusing any evidence that contradicts his positions , and disregarding the fundamental american principles and historical . 
take the example of the warming of the planet . 
in this area , bush is conspicuous by its absence without leave ( awol in military jargon ) . 
from time to time , he questions the scientific theories . 
( you know , of course , that the academic performance of bush have never impressed person ) . 
bush 's position is more than bad : it is an embarrassment . 
in fact , when asked by bush america 's national academy of sciences to examine the issue , the resounding verdict : greenhouse gases are a serious threat ( that is the only one they could produce ) . 
but the automakers love their cars that consume a lot of petrol and pals for bush to the oil industry want no interference with their destruction of the planet 's atmosphere . 
so no change environmental policies . 
in iraq , bush again pursued a unilateral programme , explaining that there was incontrovertible evidence of saddam 's links with al qaeda and that he possessed weapons of mass destruction . 
even before the invasion , there was overwhelming evidence that bush was lying . 
detection technology had clearly shown that iraq did not have nuclear weapons , as the head of the united nations inspectors , hans blix pointed out . 
it is possible that bush read those reports , but they were beyond his comprehension . 
it is also possible that he did not believe what he read . 
in any case , american policy was not based on the scientific evidence . 
since the end of the cold war , america is the world 's sole superpower . 
however , it has failed to exercise the kind of power needed to create a new world order based on principles such as fairness . 
europe and the rest of the world are aware of this failure but they do not vote in american elections . 
even so , the rest of the world is not without resort . 
the rest of the world should simply oppose bush and him 
america has not won the hearts and minds of the iraqis , but instead has lost , just as it has lost the hearts and minds of many people . 
the united states wants to retain control of the occupation , but also want other the bullets today are decimating the american troops . 
the united nations forces do not have to bear the consequences of america 's failure to manage the occupation and therefore the calls to financial aid that the united states should remain unanswered . 
what sympathy does the us agenda when we see that president bush has provided hundreds of billions of dollars of tax cuts for the richest people in the world ? 
it was not long ago , the republican congress sum of $ 1 billion that it should to the united nations and threatened to pay what they owed if the united nations will meet a set of measures . 
the lack of goodwill of america to finance small sums to wage peace contrasts sharply with the sums congress quickly granted to the war effort . 
advocates of a softer approach say that if the united nations are not , it will be their death warrant . participating in iraq , it will build the confidence of the united states , so that the next incidence of this kind , america will turn more quickly to the united nations . 
this is absurd . 
the occupants of the white house today strongly believe in the 
i normally write about economics , not politics . 
however , in the era of globalization in this new world , economic interdependence is stronger , and requires action , rules and institutions more collective , and an international rule of law . 
economic globalization has , however , exceeded political globalization and the decision-making process are far from democratic , or even transparent . 
in many cases , you can establish that the failures of globalisation date back to the same mindset that led to the failure of the iraqi occupation : multilateral institutions should not be at the service of the interests of only one country , but all countries . 
during the recent summit of the world trade organisation ( wto ) meeting in cancun , developing countries have indicated to america , and europe , that this system could no longer continue . 
in this case , europe is just as guilty as america . 
europe has no trouble seeing the dangers of unilateralism equities , since the withdrawal of kyoto until his refusal to participate in the international criminal court . 
but europe should also reflect on its own practices , including its policies to trade , especially when the eu works systematically to unbalance the global trade regime against developing countries , despite the promises to restore the balance with the ongoing negotiations . 
there , europe behaves like america , which has long adopted the rhetoric of free trade , while its actions have long ignored the principles . 
forget about america 's rhetoric on justice and fairness , in trade negotiations , the united states ignore the plea of the poorest countries in the world to put an end to the cotton subsidies that have an effect if devastating for them . 
if we must make a safer world politically and economically more stable and prosperous , globalisation will be at the level of economic globalization . 
the principles of democracy , social justice , social solidarity , and the rule of law will be extended beyond national boundaries . 
europe and the rest of the world will have to do their part : to respect these principles themselves and push each other , and america , in the right direction . 
for the moment , this requires " just say no " to president bush . 
the real cost of the iraq war 
in life , the most important things , like life itself , have not price . 
but this does not mean that the issues involving the preservation of life ( or a way of life ) , such as defense , should not be subjected to cold economic analysis and rigorous . 
shortly before the current iraq war , when larry lindsey , the economist of the bush administration , has suggested that the cost could be between $ 100 and $ 200 billion , other officials quickly demurred . 
for example , the office of management and budget director mitch daniels put the figure at $ 60 billion . 
it now appears that lindsey 's numbers were grossly underestimated . 
worried that the bush administration can be misleading everyone on the cost of the war in iraq , as it has done on weapons of mass destruction and its links with al qaeda , i agree with linda bilmes , a budget expert at harvard , to examine the issue . 
even we who are opposed to the war , were appalled by what we have discovered : our estimates , modest to moderate , vary a bit less of a trillion dollars to more than $ 2 trillion . 
our analysis starts with the $ 500 billion that the congressional budget office openly talks about , which is ten times higher than what the administration said the cost of the war . 
its estimate is wrong at this point because the figures announced do not even include the full budgetary costs to the government . 
and the budgetary costs are a fraction of the costs of the entire economy . 
the bush administration , for example , has done everything she could to hide the large number of veterans who are severely wounded : 16 000 for the moment , which more or less 20 % with serious brain and head injuries . 
so it is no surprise that its figure of $ 500 billion ignores the shortcomings and the costs of health that the government will have to pay over the next few years . 
the administration does not face the problems of military recruitment and retention . 
the result is the payment of bonuses to those who commit to new , more benefits and higher recruiting costs : an increase of 20 % just between 2003 and 2005 . 
in addition , the war is extremely wearing equipment , which he will have to replace a part . 
these budgetary costs ( without taking into account the interests ) amount to $ 652 billion in our conservative estimate and $ 799 billion for our moderate estimate . 
we can assume that as the government has not reduced other expenditures or increased taxes , these expenses were funded by debt , and the cost of interest on that debt would add $ 98 billion dollars ( conservative ) to $ 385 billion ( moderate ) to the budgetary costs . 
of course , the biggest burden of injuries and deaths is borne by the soldiers and their families . 
but the military pays disability benefits that are much lower than the value of lost earnings . 
similarly , payments for soldiers killed only amount to $ 500 , 000 , which is far below the standard estimates of the economic cost of a death life , sometimes referred to as the statistical value of a life ( of 6,1 to 6,5 million dollars ) . 
but the costs do not stop there . 
the bush administration once proclaimed that the war in iraq would be good for the economy , and a spokesman has even suggested that it was the best way to ensure low oil prices . 
as is often the case , things have turned out differently : the oil companies are the big winners , and the american and global economies have lost . 
being extremely conservative , we believe the overall effect on the economy if only 5 or $ 10 of the increase is attributed to the war . 
at the same time , money spent on the war could have been spent on something else . 
we believe that if a part of that money had been invested in roads , schools , and research , the american economy would have been stimulated more in the short term and its growth would have been higher in the long term . 
there are a number of other costs , some potentially important , which are very difficult to quantify . 
for example , the americans are paying $ 300 billion annually for the " option value " of military preparedness , which allows them to be prepared to fight where it matters . 
the fact that americans are willing to pay this suggests that this potential value exceeds the costs . 
but there is little doubt that she has been greatly diminished and will remain for several years . 
in short , even our " moderate " estimate can significantly underestimate the cost of the us commitment in iraq . 
and our estimate does not include any of the costs involved in the huge losses of life and property in iraq . 
we are not trying to explain that the american people were deliberately misled about the costs of the war , or that the bush administration 's gross underestimate must be put on the account of incompetence , as it vehemently argues is in the case of weapons of mass destruction . 
we are not trying to judge whether it was more cost-effective ways to make war . 
recent evidence that the number of deaths and injuries would have been considerably reduced if we had better body armor been provided to soldiers show how the economies in the short term can lead to long-term costs . 
it is undeniable that when the programming of a war is a matter of choice , as was the case here , inadequate preparation is even less justifiable . 
but such considerations appear to be out of reach calculations of the bush administration . 
the elaborate cost-benefit analyses of major projects have been routine in the defense department and other departments for almost half a century . 
the war in iraq was an immense " project , " and yet it now appears that the analysis of its benefits was very wrong and that of its costs virtually absent . 
one cannot help but wonder : y-avait-il other ways of spending a fraction of 1 to 2 trillion of the war in projects that would have better strengthened security , increased prosperity and promoted democracy ? 
enough freedom ? 
do democracies need values ? 
the question seems absurd in the light of photographs of american soldiers torturing and humiliating iraqi prisoners . 
the fact is that the advance of democracy went hand in hand with an erosion of shared values and the preponderance of individual autonomy . 
it presupposed moral agnosticism and plurality references , as neither devoted and compulsory . 
democracy grows certainly values , but they are generally more liberal - in other words , individual rights take collective obligations . 
for all the democrats today , the fullest possible respect for the autonomy of the individual is , as thomas jefferson , " obvious " . 
however , human rights , civil and political rights sufficient to ensure the strength and the survival of democracies ? 
are today 's democracies virtuous enough to bring renewable energy - including self-sacrifice - needed to defeat their enemies ? 
for a long time , these issues have not presented any emergency , in part because the core values of democracy were less abstract than they seem today . 
these values have fuelled the fight against nazi and soviet totalitarianism , fascism , and the military dictatorship . in their name , minorities have equality and dignity , decolonization was . 
democratic values are partisan perhaps in the defence of human rights , but it gives them a legitimate universality that the struggle against oppression , wherever it occurs . 
yet , in the more advanced countries , the promises of material prosperity made possible thanks to freedom has long since replaced attention to democratic values and defend them as cement social . 
westerners are not rushing to emulate the freedom fighters who have given birth to their society , despite the commemorations , and the persistence of oppression . 
the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks against the united states has changed all this - not only international relations , but the balance between the rights and obligations that we long for granted . 
in fact , the collapse of the twin towers , which was a surprising event in its methods , symbolic character , and its magnitude , nothing has changed . 
in itself , it does not reveal that the urgency of a fundamental reassessment long overdue . 
that is the western model of democratic development really ? 
some non-democratic systems seem to cause more support , because they are based on community solidarity , religion or the nation , because closed societies doubt and distance , critical or frivolous that open societies . 
beyond the freedoms and our economic and social system , do we have a specific society to defend ? 
our civilisation that accepts selfishness compared to his family and his group , which tolerates , with few exceptions , in terms of mature , who consider that blasphemy , criticism of power and even civil disobedience freedoms . 
better still apply companies like ours who know of the ills such as the use of drugs , prostitution , alcoholism , otherwise incivility acts of vandalism , a mullah regime or soldiers , because these social problems can be eliminated , if not totally eliminated , without changing their foundations . 
this is not true of totalitarian regimes or fundamentalists who must be slaughtered to give the day to free societies . 
but what can we respond to all manner of fundamentalists who see that most committed fighters on their side , if our civilization is worth defending ? 
can we oppose them with something other than the individual freedoms ? 
two opposite temptations must be resisted . 
the first is the return to the so-called " traditional " values , the companies own frightened : it not only would mean the withdrawal and the closure but also sometimes hatred . 
the second temptation is a modern variant of the gunboat diplomacy that focuses on the physical strength without regard for the projection of a credibility and legitimacy increased . 
when enemies attack us , we certainly need replicate immediately without too much to ask questions . 
if enemies threaten us , it is better first to assert its legitimacy , and thus acquire some credibility at home and abroad . 
nor should too wide a gap between the statement of principles and the reality of our behaviour . 
the values can no longer , not more , as before , grow out of the sky , the nature , reason or a law of history . 
our values must take body in and by the democratic debate , without more , our defence must involve three areas that you cannot separate . 
we have increasingly need to update our social pact . 
france has tried to do with the debate it has begun , and concluded by law , on secularism , a company important even if it could be better and make the link between the principles , the social realities and anthropological and great policies . 
such a debate should also involve school , its rules , its objectives and contents . 
note , however , that in many countries , the political parties are finding it difficult to engage in such discussions . 
the second major axis of such action of re-creation of values is what i call the constitution social and fiscal society , will have to add the environmental rules . 
the so-called " community " , the issues related to the gap fortunes , the legitimacy of the inequalities , the definition of justice , the redistribution , etc. will come with a greater force in the political debate . 
this debate has not taken place in the united states , despite the fickleness of the beginning of the clinton administration ; it was only a beginning of response in the uk and germany with the third way of blair and gerhard schr√∂der 's variant . 
in france , it is because of the strength of the conflicts of distribution , deep division of the left and the absence of economic and social vision of the right . 
are the values connected to the new world order : of course , the prerequisite for such values is the exemplary conduct and not procedural " values " linked to crisis management or settlement of disputes . 
we must also take care that short-term interests do not harm the objectives more long-term fundamentals . 
the fight for democracy cannot be selective . 
a desirable vision for the future of the world must appeal to the shared conceptions of justice and fairness . 
we must all become freedom fighters . 
last hope for venezuela : elections 
venezuela is mired in a dangerous stalemate . 
president hugo ch√°vez clings to power despite the obvious failure of his government marked by a serious economic deterioration and dangerous political polarization . 
the opposition , tainted by his botched coup in april 2002 , now seeks to force mr ch√°vez to the resignation by the organisation of a costly general strike . 
each part justifies his intransigence with arguments propaganda . 
its sympathizers glorify ch√°vez as the defender of the poor besieged by a selfish , coup-plotting elite . 
his fiercest opponents are mr ch√°vez as an autocrat pursuing a revolution to destroying democracy . 
these two points of view are questionable . 
the ch√°vez government has not been a great help to the poorer classes of venezuela . 
on the contrary , his belligerent rhetoric and inept governance scared off investors , causing an economic downturn and rising unemployment and poverty . 
today mr ch√°vez no longer enjoys the support of the majority of the poor . 
the opposition is formed the bulk of venezuela 's organized civil society : the business world , but also the trade unions , professional associations , and ngos . 
so venezuela 's polarization does not " poor " to " the oligarchy , " but a populist civil society . 
the opinion of the opposition , that share the right wing of the bush administration , is equally unconvincing . 
rather than initiating a revolution , mr ch√°vez spouts fiery rhetoric . 
while his democratic credentials are dubious , it has never 
but ch√°vez 's insistence on the inviolability of the current constitution is hypocritical . 
four years earlier , mr ch√°vez is separate from the old constitution by using a plebiscite to create a new , tailor-made for him . 
today he invokes the charter to fend off calls for a plebiscite on the continuation of its mandate . 
the paradox here is that ch√°vez 's earlier example could be the solution to the impasse today . 
since mr ch√°vez used para-constitutional means to promote its desire for change in 1999 , that the international community is not limited to the constitution in force to resolve this crisis plaguing the nation . 
in fact , the latin american members of the " group of friendly nations " trying to mediate in the conflict can draw an interesting experiment to devise such a solution . 
after all , such confrontations are not unusual in latin america 's rigid presidential systems . 
when the heads of government elected for fixed terms of office does not political support , they cannot be removed by a censure motion as it exists in parliamentary systems . 
presidential systems can therefore suffer long conflicts that represent a threat to democracy , as is the case in venezuela at this time . 
however , during the last decade , latin american politicians have made presidential systems more flexible in finding innovative ways to remove unpopular presidents . 
one of ch√°vez 's discredited predecessors was relieved of his duties following accusations little serious crime commission ; ecuador 's congress declared a president disastrous " mentally incompetent " ; in peru , an autocratic president , was forced into exile after months of international pressure and local . 
when politicians interpreted the law with a certain amount of creativity in these circumstances , they usually do to ensure the survival of fragile democracies in full crisis . 
as long as these maneuvers do and do not become easy ammunition to the opposition of the moment , they act as a safety valve for presidential systems . 
international monitoring can also serve as a safeguard against frivolous use of such mechanisms . 
let us hope that the group of friendly nations can help put in place an innovative solution in venezuela 's standoff . 
to be acceptable to both sides , such a solution can only respond to the wishes of each of the parties . 
the opposition prefers a vote " all or nothing " about the continuation of the mandate of mr ch√°vez , a vote that she would probably win , but that mr. ch√°vez will never accept . 
mr ch√°vez insists on the recall referendum mechanism planned in its constitution , what the opposition cannot tolerate : get rid of the president and would require a far greater number of votes than by mr ch√°vez at the last elections . 
and rising abstention makes it virtually impossible . 
both proposals is therefore possible politically . 
only a democratic mechanism solution to the conflict which would not predict the outcome of the consultation is likely to be adopted . 
this mechanism , it is the holding of elections , to organise as soon as possible ( this summer is the most realistic ) . 
each side will have to work hard to win the victory . 
the opposition , tense , will have to go beyond the rejection of mr ch√°vez ; it will have to develop a programme for the reconstruction of the country and unite to support an attractive candidate . 
president ch√°vez will need to clarify the content and the sense of his " bolivarian revolution . " 
as mr ch√°vez is a skilled campaigner and the opposition remains divided , he will have a chance of winning , which should make him accept this solution . 
pressure from the group of friendly nations could lead to each party to accept this last chance to avoid a crash policy . 
elections can be legitimized by an amendment to the constitution to reduce the presidential term , as proposed by jimmy carter in his recent mediation effort . 
since this is designed to defuse an exceptional crisis , it would not create a precedent that would encourage frivolous attacks on latin america 's democratically elected governments . 
the organisation of elections in venezuela today would save , not undermine , democracy . 
the dangerous links to syria 
all eyes are on syria following the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri . 
opposition groups in lebanon , as well as the supporters of mr hariri , openly accused the regime of syrian president bashar assad , to be responsible for the killing . 
the bush administration , without formally blaming syria , is not far to do the same thing and recalled its ambassador to damascus . 
the us is said to be very angry with syria and its refusal to withdraw its troops from lebanon as required a un resolution . 
the growing opposition against syrian hegemony in lebanon is that one of the four related problems syria must face and that she has treated inappropriately . 
the other three problems are the actions of syria in iraq , its relations with the united states and the need for domestic reform . 
while corrosive immobility is one of the characteristics of the syrian regime , these challenges threaten to reinforce each other and marginalize syria even more than it already is internationally . 
in lebanon , the syrians have repeatedly misread the bush administration 's intentions . 
in september , the united states , with the support of france , have supported the resolution 1559 of the un security council demanding the withdrawal of syrian troops and the disarming of militias , and mainly hezbollah . 
it happened after the unconstitutional extension of the mandate of the lebanese president emile lahoud , despite french and american warnings imposed by mr assad in september . 
until now , however , syrian officials privately say that they do not believe that the united states is serious about a withdrawal . 
the syrian leaders continue to reject requests from lebanon to put an end to the syrian military presence in place for 28 years . 
these demands escalated since the death of mr hariri , when tens of thousands of supporters of former prime minister have called for the departure of syria , so that they did not take position so far on syria . 
indeed , a broad multi-communal opposition front is formed in beirut to demand the departure of syria . 
yet rather than meet the requirements of this front and create a healthy bilateral relationship between countries on an equal footing , syria has sought to divide the opposition to reassert its control . 
the hariri assassination further complicates the situation and syria must prepare for a strong reaction from france and the united states . 
in iraq , since the fall of baghdad on april 9 , 2003 , damascus has shown a nostalgia for the old system . 
despite the fierce opposition between the syrian and iraqi baath parties , they both were members belonging to a confederation of despots . 
for the syrians , a democratic iraq and friendly to the united states has always been worse than saddam hussein , an enemy they knew , and with whom they have done exchanges profitable , when iraq suffered international sanctions . 
the support of the iraqi baathist exiles syria threatens to damage relations with the new iraq . 
baghdad has repeatedly accused the assad regime of allowing iraqi funds to be channeled to insurgents , and recently informed the syrians to the discovery of a photograph of a senior syrian intelligence in the company of an islamist combatant was found on the latter 's body in falluja . 
following the election , a legitimate power emerges in iraq and the syrians will have to show foresight in jettisoning their pro-saddam acquaintances . 
the bush administration 's growing impatience with syrian involvement in the iraqi insurgency is one of the main reasons for the deterioration of relations between the united states and syria . 
indeed , the disdain for syria in washington is clear . 
that is why syria 's denials to its destructive role in iraq are rarely taken seriously and that is why mr assad receives no american support for the resumption of negotiations with israel on the golan heights . 
some signs also show that the syrians are unable to measure american intentions on other issues . 
mr assad , for example , still do not understand , apparently , that the bush administration associates his regime to terrorism . 
syrian officials believe that the baath party the unwavering support of the united states against the islamist resurgence . 
they do not understand that american officials regard syria as complicit in the activities of islamist terrorist groups in the palestinian territories , iraq and lebanon . 
at home , the assad regime also meeting a few difficulties . 
the political and economic reforms do not argue that small , when they are moving . 
one of the main elements of discussion in syria is the revival of islam as an alternative to a political and economic system which offers little encouragement , except in the case of the great characters of the regime . 
france 's opposition to the syrian presence in lebanon was partly the result of disenchantment with assad 's reformist ambitions , and the european union has expressed similar reservations . 
assad is now in phase of consolidation , which leaves little room for reform . 
indeed , his new interior minister , ghazi kanaan , the hardliner belonging to the old school , took the head of a crackdown on reformers and kurds over the past year . 
the reshuffle last november that brought kanaan and other was regarded as the thinking of the preferences of mr assad . 
in the coming months , several rounds of retirements should allow the president to put his pawns to positions of responsibility . 
the consolidation , however , is not reform . 
mr assad will have to show that his enhanced authority can lead to a true transformation . 
until now , the president has followed a hard line on iraq , lebanon and the internal affairs . 
if he is a reformer , it has not convinced . 
syria may pay a heavy price for this ambiguity . 
the racial house divided europe 
the extreme right is characterised by his racism and use of the immigration issue as a political wedge . 
the northern league in italy , the vlaams blok in the netherlands , the supporters of le pen 's national front in france , are all examples of parties or movements trained on the common theme of aversion to immigrants and the promotion of simplistic policies to control them . 
while individuals like jorg haidar and jean-marie le pen can go and ( ever ) come soon enough , the race question will not disappear from the european policy in the near future . 
an ageing population and the borders of increasingly open involve an increasing racial fragmentation in european countries . 
mainstream parties of the centre left and centre right have confronted this prospect in applying the policy of the sand , hoping against hope that the problem would disappear . 
this is not the case , as the clearly demonstrates america 's racial history . 
race relations in the us have been for decades - and remain - the center of the political scene , to the point that racial cleavages are as important as income , if not more , as determinants of political preferences and attitudes . 
the first step to address the issue of racial politics is to understand the origin and the consequences of racial animosity , even if it means the discovery unpleasant truths . 
this is precisely the purpose in large part by teams of research in economics , sociology , psychology and political science in the united states . 
this research shows that the representatives of different races are much less confidence with each other ; whites are less inclined to support social welfare spending , which , according to them , promote minorities ; communities more fragmented racially have governments less effective , corruption and influence peddling more important , rates of crime higher and less productive public goods by dollar imposed . 
this does not mean that it should eliminate the heterogeneity and create racially homogenous communities , but it is necessary to recognise the reality of these problems in order to begin to produce solid public policies on race relations . 
of course , americans are contesting the methods to use . 
some favor affirmative action programs that provide preferences for minorities in the allocation of employment , admission to the university and the public contracts . 
these policies are seen as a way of offering reparations for past injustices and , more important , creating role models and to overcome residual and perhaps involuntary discrimination . 
others are protesting against affirmative action and argue that a policy that does not care about race , combined with the policies of the free market and values family pro , is enough to create jobs for minorities and to help not to separate the black families . 
this last point is crucial in any policy because one of the most important causes of poverty in the us is the diffusion of single parents ( read single mother ) in the black community . 
whatever the answer , the question is that the determination of the measures to be taken about race is a dominant issue in american politics . 
of course , minorities have made progress towards more integration and economic success . 
in the 1950s , blacks could not sit in the front of the bus , today two of the main players in american foreign policy are black . 
we cannot deny that right wing american politicians continue to deploy the " race card " as a tactical tool . 
take the case of patrick buchanan , the former nixon and reagan who is an independent presidential candidate in the last election . 
he recently published a successful book entitled " the death of the west : how dying populations and immigrant invasion imperil our country and civilization . " 
but for every book like this there are ten others with a serious analysis of the issue of race in america . 
the analysis and political debates on race relations have considerable delay in europe . 
at most , the question is carefully considered in terms of immigration quotas and border restrictions , not in terms of social problems and opportunities created by an increasingly racially mixed europe . 
of course , a clear immigration policy is needed in order to avoid the accumulation of illegal immigrants . 
but it is not enough : border controls with mexico does not mean the end of american policy on domestic race issues ! 
europe is rich and its rapidly aging population : europeans , strengthened by generous welfare programs , are no longer prepared to accept " dirty jobs " in , say , agriculture and the leather industry . 
this attitude makes it inevitable the increase of immigration . 
europeans , however , are quick to criticise the us for the failures of their policy toward minorities and for any manifestation of racism on the other side of the atlantic . 
reading the european press is often appear a superiority complex towards the us on racial issues : they ( the americans ) have problems with racism ; we are immune from it , with the exception of crazed neo-nazi skinheads and their like . 
what happened in recent weeks , from paris to amsterdam , shows that the race problem in europe is more profound and , as in the us , has to question the sad truth that race relations are inherently difficult and trust and cooperative behavior does not travel well on racial lines . 
if europe 's mainstream parties not undertake more seriously to understand racial tensions in their country and put " race " at the centre of their priorities , individuals such as the pen are bound to try to fill the gap with their message of hate . 
combat the french exception 
the attention of europe today is any tour and on enlargement and on the constitution under negotiation between the member states . 
however , the result of several gallic skirmishes with the european commission will be no less important in determining the fate of the new and enlarged europe . 
france has unilaterally chosen to ignore the stability and growth pact leaving run its public deficit beyond the limit of 3 % of gdp . 
the french like to talk about the rational rigour of their thinking , but where budgets are concerned , descartes is no longer and obfuscation is . 
france was part of the main criticisms of ireland , when , in 2000 , the irish government reduced its budget surplus , who was then at 4 % , to a mere 0.5 % . 
other countries have not complied with the stability pact , but france is the first country to do so with a little smile satisfied openly contemptuous . 
none of this should be surprising . 
france is only applied to eu rules its engrained habit to consider its own culture as an exception . 
thus , france consistently vetoes reform of the european union 's common agricultural policy . 
as everyone knows , the cap is a fine gift to wealthy european ( especially french ) farmers at the expense of the struggling farmers in developing countries and european consumers . 
france is also trying to return to old policies of bail out private companies on the brink of collapse in a stream of public money . 
the european commissioner for competition , mario monti , cannot lose this battle : he needs the support of those who have faith in the markets and equal treatment for all . 
the story is simple . 
the french government plans to bail out alstom , a company that has developed of high-tech products , including the tgv , the high-speed train french , but recently went into bankruptcy . 
the french government claims that it will never back down from its plan to rescue alstom , a plan that has all the usual dirigiste motivations : maintaining employment , protection of investors , etc . 
in addition , since alstom is a high-tech company , the french government plays the map of research and development , arguing that investment in r & d is good for growth . 
save alstom by nationalizing the company is obviously a mistake . 
the company consists of different units , some profitable , other bankrupt : it is clear that we must dismantle it . 
the profitable parts , such as the tgv , will easily find buyers ; the unprofitable plants should be closed . 
french taxpayers " money is better spent in the temporary costs for displaced workers rather than to keep alive a company which is not beneficial . 
it is important that the european commission does not allow france to carve out special rules for itself in competition policy , as it appears to be doing with budget deficits . 
the commission must condemn the public financing of private companies in france as it condemns subsidies in any other eu member state . 
the commission has already achieved some success on this front , notably forcing germany to cancel government guarantees of public banks . 
alstom in particular and france in general should not be an exception and must meet the same standards . 
if the commission does not react , the european union will look even more like a playground for the french officials . 
france has already taken the head of the european union 's foreign policy with its foreign minister , dominique de villepin , which is more and more like a foreign minister for europe . 
at the same time , france violates key rules of common economic policy and public aid to private companies . 
the european commission it will lose the credibility that remains to him to end up looking like a parisian district of lesser importance ? 
lose on alstom would have serious repercussions in europe , and not only for competition policy . 
the war for oil 
for decades , both republicans than the democrats are pursuing the same objectives in the oil field : maintain as much as possible the stability of the price of oil , reduce soft domestic consumption , reduce dependence on imports and diversify the foreign supply sources . 
despite appearances , these objectives are always the same today , under the bush administration . 
many observers believe that with the invasion of iraq , bush has chosen a different path . 
a significant increase in the iraqi production would probably increase oil dependency of the us . 
the price of a barrel of oil will fall without doubt with the emergence of a new source of supply , an increase in us dependence , particularly in relation to the middle east . 
it is ironic that the us exercised more control over iraqi oil in the context of the " oil-for-food program " of the un before the war ( it was then the un and not saddam hussein , determined the level of iraqi exports ) that they will not do so in the context of a future democratic iraq . 
if the bush administration was seeking oil supply stable , secure , diverse and cheap , it was enough to lift the embargo against libya , iran , iraq and sudan and let the oil gush . 
but america 's interest in iraqi oil is not dictated by the economy or energy policy . 
the bush administration has acknowledged that iraqi oil is above all a geopolitical asset . 
who controls iraqi oil , control iraq . 
saddam had to its power to the fact that he controlled the world 's second largest oil reserve . 
he knew perfectly well what it had to black gold . 
faced with the possibility of invasion and the defeat , it has threatened to set fire to the iraqi oil fields . 
the destruction and looting of iraqi oil facilities and pipelines shows that almost everyone understood that control oil is controlling the country . 
in the run-up to the invasion by the united states , securing the oil fields was a priority . 
the aim was not to increase supply and lower prices on the american market , but the overthrow of saddam and its replacement by a new government . 
the future of iraq is linked to oil production of the country . 
but given the vagaries of the oil market , especially in a situation that is as unstable , we do not see how the bush administration will be able to achieve its objectives in the coming years . 
the problem is simple . 
the us must use oil revenues to ease the financial burden of regime change in iraq on american taxpayers . 
in the long term , all reconstruction plan depends on the ability of iraq to export large volumes of oil . 
if iraq does not produce oil , president bush cannot keep the promises he made to the iraqi people , the american people and the international community . 
before the invasion , iraq had a production capacity of three million barrels of oil per day . 
but it cannot go back to that level of production in the time allotted to establish an iraqi government . 
an increase in the production requires the development of oil installations , which means big investments , a government in place and political stability . 
nobody , not even the bush administration expects that these conditions are met shortly . 
political stability is the main condition for increasing production capacity . 
the experience of iran , kuwait , russia , and even iraq , shows that it takes about three years of political stability before production capacity can significantly increase and sustainable . 
iraq needs several years to draw up a new constitution , establish a democratic government , negotiate the distribution of oil revenues between the different regions , regulate investment and make the economy attractive to foreign investors . 
it also needs time to negotiate with multinational oil companies and neighbouring countries the achievement of the technical and feasibility studies necessary , as well as reconstruction , rehabilitation and exploration of its oil fields . 
also , even a period of 3 years seems optimistic , because it assumes that during this time the occupation stops , the iraqis are setting up their own government and an end to political instability . 
but the reality may be quite different . 
tensions may remain high for years . 
and it would not be surprising that if iraqi oil production interrupting brutally , even with a democratic government . 
history shows that the strikes and social unrest that can halt oil production are more easily in a democratic context that under a dictatorship . 
if iraq is unable to increase its oil production in the next few years , this will be a thorn in the side , for both foreign policy and energy policy of the united states . 
how these us finance the long-term reconstruction of iraq ? 
who will pay for the maintenance of a fragile democracy in iraq ? 
the us sustain their occupation without ensuring the feeding of the iraqi people , medical care and other basic services ? 
these are tough questions , and we cannot answer before a democratic regime can control and ensure the iraqi oil production . 
let murderers defend human rights 
if it were not so sad , this would be the sick joke of the millennium : libya has been elected to chair the united nations commission on human rights ! 
when caligula appointed his horse to the senate , the horse , at least , had no blood on its hooves . 
the procedure , of course , was perfectly legal : the presidency changes every year from a region of the world to another . 
this year , it was the turn of africa to appoint the president and she appointed libya . 
only the us and canada have voted against it . 
has their everlasting shame , european countries abstained . 
this says a lot about the moral bankruptcy of the united nations that this decision comes at a delicate moment for the organization . 
president bush has challenged the un to show they are serious about their own mandatory decisions about iraq : otherwise , they can hear the same ignominious end as the league of nations , which proved impotent in the 1930s when confronted with the aggressive policies of nazi germany and fascist italy . 
the election of libya to chair a un body responsible for respect human rights at the present time will not support the legitimacy or the moral authority of the world body . 
remember that libya is a totalitarian tyranny ; its leader , muammar ghaddafi , combines a sometimes erratic behavior with extremist policies supporting dictators all over the world . 
it leads one of the world 's most oppressive regimes , in which there is no pretense of election and where the opposing views are instantly crushed . 
under his rule , libya has supported terrorist organizations worldwide , the ira to many palestinian extremist groups . 
it remains under un sanctions for the role it has played in the downing of a pan am flight over lockerbie , scotland , ten years ago . 
over the last decade , the position of the united nations as a symbol of the ideals of a peaceful world community has regularly been undermined . 
they proved utterly unable to stop the war in the balkans ; and in at least one case , srebrenica , dutch forces of the united nations for the maintenance of peace remained there and witnessed the worst massacre of post-war europe while bosnian serbs murdered around 6 000 muslims defenceless . 
a dutch committee of inquiry later admitted that the un dutch battalion was , in fact , complicit in this war crime . 
in rwanda , when the genocide began , the united nations representative in charge of peacekeeping operations ordered the evacuation of un forces from the country , leaving the field open to genocide the bloodiest since the second world war . 
the name of this united nations representative is kofi annan . 
it is a depressing and pitiful that the un is trying , probably in vain , to redeem by appearing in the iraq crisis , as the voice of reason and international legitimacy . 
but at a time when the un inspections in iraq are like sending the salvation army to remove a bunch of gangsters , it may be that the election of libya to the head of the commission of human rights remains a historic date as the definitive failure of an organisation whose creation had raised a huge hope . 
organizations usually do not die , and certainly , there are too many state reason not to ensure that the united nations will continue to be an obstacle . 
but they will be a mere shadow of what it should , and could be . 
the united nations today gives hypocrisy a bad reputation . 
supporters of the authority are 
last thursday , the judges of the court 's central jakarta in indonesia have sentenced to a year in prison . 
i am guilty , in my quality of editor of tempo weekly newsmagazine , according to the court , of defaming tomy winata , a business tycoon , for having his possible involvement in a fire in south-east asia textile market in jakarta and of fomenting riots in disseminating lies . 
my case and other cases , portend the end of a short democratic experience in indonesia ? 
the " riot " that i instigated occurred in march last year , when nearly 200 thugs be winata 's followers attacked the offices of tempo , threatening to burn down the building , harassed the staff and injuring a journalist . 
to try to resolve the situation peacefully , i was persuaded to negotiate in the office of central jakarta police station , but found horrified , that the leaders this the clique had taken power in the police station . 
i was punched and kicked as the police looked the other way . 
fortunately , many journalists came to our rescue with tape recorders and cameras to record the events . 
the spread of these images prompted public indignation and forced parliament to open a public inquiry . 
the leaders of the national police and the jakarta police were called and , because of the strong pressure of public opinion , the leaders of the mob were charged . 
however , winata himself eluded police investigation simply by stating publicly that his followers acted without the knowledge and without its agreement . 
he himself complaint against ahmad taufik , the author of the article , teuku iskandar ali , the publisher , and myself . 
the hearings of the trial , which dragged on a year were marked by a series of developments suspects all in favour winata . 
first , the case built by the police and the prosecutor contained documents so obviously falsified that the police indicted two officers . 
but the court rejected our request to suspend hearings until the clarification of the legality of the issue of prosecutor . 
the case against the officers involved appears to be going nowhere . 
on the contrary , one of them has been promoted to head the new jakarta anti-terror unit be set up ( and is funded by the us ) . 
the other has reportedly been sent to the school of police to receive specialist training . 
then , after six months of hearings , the head judge of the panel of three judges was suddenly promoted to become the head of a city court an hour of jakarta . 
one of my lawyers noted that in 35 years of practice at the court , he had never seen a head judge replaced in an ongoing case . 
in fact , despite her promotion , the judge continued to preside over another case in the same building . 
a judge who had previously ruled against tempo in winata 's civil suit him . 
finally , winata , during his testimony , he perjured himself by denying having been interviewed by tempo . 
a recording of the telephone conversation was broadcast at the hearings , the journalist who conducted the interview and the two editors who ; sworn under oath , the telephone company official documents attesting to this phone call as proof of its existence and an expert witness concluded that the voice on the recording was to tomy winata . 
but the judges rejected the request of tempo calling for the arrest of winata for it to be considered for perjury , telling us of a complaint to the police , which we did . 
the judges then rejected our request for a postponement of the court decision until the case of false testimony of mr winata is judged . 
given all these vices of form , my conviction and prison sentence are hardly surprising . 
but i remain hopeful of winning in the end , when the appeal of tempo will be higher courts . 
the courts indonesians superiors are more respectful of ethics and the director of the supreme court is a staunch defender of democracy and freedom of expression . the case of tempo could well become a decisive step for our democracy , like the famous decision to the us supreme court in the new york times against sullivan . 
by raising the threshold of defamation charges , this decision has allowed the american press calling for those responsible to account of public affairs . 
no country knows better than indonesia that freedom of expression and freedom of the press are proven indicators of democratic development , and that criminalizing journalists is one of the first symptoms of authoritarianism . 
indonesia was a liberal democracy in the 1950s , before the press crackdown by president sukarno , helped by the military junta , in 1956 . 
any criticism , consolidating unchecked power was easier and , in july 1959 , sukarno decreed the beginning of " guided democracy . " 
for the first few years after sukarno 's fall in 1966 , all the benefits of genuine democracy , including freedom of the press , were restored ( except for the communists ) . 
however , the president suharto 's regime began in the gagging of the press in the early 1970s , suspending various newspapers and jailing many journalists . 
the press muzzled , other political rights were quickly violated and indonesian democracy failed once more . 
since the fall of suharto in 1998 , indonesia has become the third largest democratic country in the world and the first democratic muslim community of history . 
the free , fair and peaceful elections were held by twice for the election of parliament and the direct election of the president , including the last presidential elections , demonstrating the possible co-existence between islam and democracy . 
the enemies of democracy , however , never rest . 
islamic extremist groups have launched in bomb attacks without distinction , while groups with authoritarian tendencies have made a breakthrough in the circles of president megawati . 
but mrs megawati has just lost the recent presidential elections . 
susilo , the newly elected president , it will continue to prosecute journalists ? 
my conviction , and the trial and convictions of other journalists , it will mark the beginning of the end of indonesia 's hard-won third democracy ? 
the answer lies in the support that indonesian pro-democracy activists can generate domestically and internationally . 
losing indonesia , potential beacon of hope to all pro-democracy activists in the muslim world , would be a terrible defeat . 
the moral of capital punishment . 
the us is often criticized for their refusal to abolish the death penalty . 
many now claim that the abolition of the death penalty is a necessary condition to establish a civilized system of criminal law . 
the nobel peace prize winner gary becker is not this opinion . 
european governments are resolutely opposed to the death penalty -- the european union banned completely , and some europeans consider its use in the united states barbaric . 
in fact , many european intellectuals argue that the death penalty , and punishment in general , does not deter criminals . 
but , while europeans , with crime rates well below those of the united states in the last half-century , could long afford some " soft " in most of the crimes , they have seen their crime rates increase sharply over the past 20 years . 
on the contrary , american rates have fallen , partly thanks to greater use of punishment . 
the death penalty . 
i am for the execution of some people convicted of murder because , and for that reason alone , i believe that it deters other murders . 
if i did not believe that , i would be opposed to capital punishment , because revenge and other possible motives should not be a basis for public policy . 
serious empirical research on death penalty in the united states began with a study of isaac ehrlich , published in 1975 in the american economic review . 
some studies that have followed have sometimes found a much weaker deterrent effect , others a much stronger effect . 
however , the information available are quite limited , so one should not base its conclusions solely on the econometric evidence . 
of course , public policy in terms of punishment cannot expect the evidence is perfect . 
but even with the limited quantitative evidence available , good reasons to believe the deterrent power of capital punishment are sufficient . 
most people , and murderers in particular , are afraid of death , especially when it follows swiftly and almost the commission of a murder . 
as david hume about suicide , " no man has ever rejected life , while it was worth living . 
this is our natural horror of death ... " similarly , schopenhauer believed that " when the horrors of life reach the point where they exceed the horrors of the death , a man puts an end to her life . 
but the terrors of the death considerable resistance ... " 
opponents of the death penalty often proclaim that the state has no moral right to take anyone 's life , including that of the most reprehensible murderer . 
yet it is absolutely the wrong conclusion for who believe that the death penalty is a deterrent . 
to see why , suppose that for every murderer executed ( instead of , say , to be sentenced to life in prison ) , the number of murders is reduced to three , which is a much lower number than ehrlich and other estimates of the deterrent effect . 
this means that for every murderer not executed , three innocent victims would die . 
in fact , the government " would take " indirectly many lives if it did not use the death penalty . 
save three innocent lives for every person executed seems like a very attractive , and even two lives saved by execution seems like a cost / benefit ratio persuasive in favour of the death penalty . 
admittedly , however , the argument in favour of capital punishment becomes less clear-cut when the number of lives saved each execution falls . 
but even if only one life were saved each execution , the market can still be desirable if life saved is much better than the life removed , which is usually the case . 
many people object to compare the qualities of life spared and the deleted . 
yet i do not see how to prevent such a comparison . 
take the case of a career criminal wheel and killing a victim who led a decent life and left several children and a partner behind it . 
suppose it would be possible to save the life of an innocent victim in executing such a criminal . 
it seems obvious to me that save the life of such a victim must carry more weight than taking the criminal 's life . 
of course , all the cases are not as clear , but a comparison of the qualities of individual lives must be part of any reasonable social policy . 
this is also why the death penalty should be used only for murder and not for lesser crimes . 
when it comes to choose between taking lives and , for example , reduce the property theft , the thesis of more lenient punishment is much more powerful . 
although serious assaults , including some gruesome rapes , are sometimes the murders in severity , and could possibly call the death penalty , i am not for its use in this type of case . 
one of the main arguments for reserving capital punishment for murders is " marginal deterrence . " 
if the attacks were punished by the death penalty , this would bring the attackers to kill their victims for not be discovered ( which is a major reason for the severity of the punishment is proportional to the seriousness of the crimes ) . 
one of the complications may be , however , that a murderer fight harder to avoid being captured , which could lead to more deaths . 
but , although marginal deterrence is important , i believe that the resistance of murderers to their capture , sometimes at the expense of their own lives , is really indirect evidence that criminals fear the death penalty . 
of course , the risk of executing innocent people that worries me . 
my support for capital punishment would weaken much if the rate of killing of innocent people was as important as many claim . 
however , i believe that the appeal process in the united states offers enormous protection , not so much against wrongful convictions against wrongful execution , which means that there is very little , if any , cases of people executed for which it is proved that they were innocent . 
and this situation has been strengthened enormously with the development of dna identification . 
i say again that the debate about the death penalty is a debate on the deterrent power ( which may be reduced by lengthy appeals ) . 
i can understand that some people are skeptical about the evidence , although i think they are wrong about this , and the common sense of the problem . 
it is very disturbing to take someone 's life , even a murderer , but sometimes highly unpleasant actions are necessary to prevent even worse behavior causing the death of innocent victims . 
the people against putin 
i have contributed to the choice of vladimir putin to succeed the first democratically elected president , boris yeltsin . 
given that the structures such as the kgb and the mafia now run russia and manipulate the judicial system , it is assumed that yeltsin wanted to choose himself his successor in order to avoid prosecution . 
but we who have chosen putin were charged with finding a successor to continue yeltsin 's reforms , and not someone who would protect him and his family . 
yeltsin was fearless and did not have its own survival , but the survival of the democratic idea that he introduced in russia . 
yet that idea is now threatened by the successor we chose . 
i do not deny the responsibility of my support for putin . 
we were not close friends , but he and i worked together in critical situations , and i never doubted his sincerity . 
putin acts according to his beliefs . 
the problem is that his convictions , including the belief that russia can prosper if it is ruled by a single source of power , are wrong . 
and this gross error is leading russia to political ruin . 
of course , no one can take a high office without making mistakes , even fundamental misunderstandings , and this is especially true when times are confused . 
yeltsin was no exception to the rule , but he recognized his errors . 
when it withdrew the 31 december 1999 , he asked forgiveness for launching the war in chechnya . 
putin , however , seems incapable of recognizing and admit his mistakes , and persists in a policy long after its failure is visible to the world . 
one of the yeltsin 's errors was his failure to put moral priorities at the head of his reform agenda . 
russia should have repented of stalinism and the gulag system . 
the whole nation , without exception , should have repented , as the germans have done since 1945 . 
this failure account , because he has allowed the unconditional faith of putin in central authority to lead to a new capture of the state by the security services . 
indeed , a direct result of the national repentance should have been the banning of the communist party and the disqualification of political office of those who have worked for the kgb . 
even if such political screenings are not simple in postcommunist societies , where victims and staff were so many , and the border between the two sometimes so vague , a viable solution could be found , as in the czech republic . 
the choice to do nothing has left the security structures unscathed and able to make a political comeback , what they have now achieved . 
the political resurrection of kgb structures under putin , and their efforts to silence dissent , has once again turned russia in a country of defectors . 
it is impossible to silence the politicians and independent media without stifle the independent sources of money , which explains that putin 's kremlin has concentrated its attacks on the so-called " oligarchs . " 
mikhail khodorkovsky 's arrest and trial have been orchestrated for precisely this reason . 
by removing independent sources of money , the security services that dominate the kremlin hope to destroy independent political life in russia . 
without independent bases of thought , this is a climate of fear is taking hold . 
but the fear is not only degrading , it does not allow to govern . 
yeltsin intuitively understood that fear and top-down , centralized decision-making could not be the right way to lead a modern country , and he therefore insisted on reforming the relationship between citizens and the state . 
putin still does not understand that a centralized political system is also unable to understand and to correct the mistakes today than it was in the soviet era . 
without a solid education , putin is , quite frankly , leading russia to the same disintegration that accompanied the collapse of the soviet state . 
the people are beginning to realize this . 
he notes that putin 's desire to create a strong and effective modern state cannot be achieved , because a modern state is governed not from above , but by informed citizens who forcing their leaders to acknowledge and correct their mistakes . 
putin , too , seems to suspect his regime 's impotence . 
this is one of the reasons that russia has become so aggressive with its neighbours , ukraine and georgia , and seeks to maintain a military presence in places like transdniestria , the breakaway region of moldova . 
by imposing itself in neighbouring regions of russia , the kremlin thinks that it can persuade the russians to his omnipotence . 
given the neutered debates in russia and that the kremlin is able to manipulate elections , regime change is the only option left to preserve the idea of democracy . 
it is futile to cling to illusions . 
those who oppose putin must decide what they want and announce that , if the regime fails to uphold the constitution , they have the right to force it to do so by all means . 
today , the question of power in russia can no longer be decide to the polls . 
as in ukraine , lebanon and kyrgyzstan , it will be decided in the street . 
impose and spend ( please ) 
excessive taxation can blunt incentives and hinder growth . 
but too little taxation can produce the same effects . 
governments with meager tax revenues may not provide basic public goods . 
worse still , low tax revenues in poor countries often result from defects in tax collection systems ( rather than low tax rates ) that also promote not productivity . 
india illustrates the importance of a well-designed tax system . 
in bangalore , high-tech companies have built world-class campuses replete with flawless lawns and high-speed data communication networks . 
outside of these campuses , however , extend open sewers , uncollected garbage , and roads in disrepair . 
while technology companies instantaneously transmit terabytes of data to remote continents , the local transport advance at an almost medieval pace . 
therefore , companies in bangalore run their own bus services , contract with private suppliers for drinking water , and install generators to protect themselves against the power cuts . 
the state can not fix this disaster because it is bankrupt . 
india 's government debt exceeds 70 % of gdp so that more than half of its tax revenues are devoted to paying interest . 
but debt is not the fact of excessive spending in the past . 
india 's government expenditures account for about 15 % of gdp , compared to an average of around 40 % of gdp in the oecd . 
the financial difficulties of india have rather to cause a tax system poorly conceived and badly managed . 
rates and rules for income tax individuals and businesses seem reasonable by international standards . 
however , india 's government collects income taxes amounting to only about 3,7 % of gdp , about half of those in south korea and other asian tigers . 
agriculture in india represents about a quarter of gdp , but even the rich farmers do not pay taxes . 
the export businesses in the software industry and in other industries enjoy tax holidays on their profits , although their employees do pay taxes on their personal incomes . 
despite reasonable rates , tax fraud is commonplace . 
fraud is explained by the fact that the government has not invested in the staff or in the systems to detect tax evaders , which are rarely in prison and who can often get out of paying bribes when they are caught . 
more subtly , the evasion of " direct " taxes on income and profits reflects the mess in the system of " indirect " taxes levied on production and consumption . 
excise taxes account for more than 60 % of india 's indirect taxes , which in turn represent the same proportion of its total tax receipts . 
the basic excise tax has been set at 16 % of the value of the production of a company . 
then there are a variety of cuts , exemptions , and surcharges . 
for example , a " rates of law to conditions " of 8 % is levied on categories like food products , matches , the son of cotton and computers . 
an additional " special excise duty " of 8 % is levied on products that include polyester strands , cars , air conditioners and tires . 
an " additional excise duty " ( not to be confused with the " special excise duty " ) is levied on " products of special importance . " 
exemptions from excise taxes are numerous and complex , including the companies with total annual revenues of less than 10 million rupees and businesses located in certain troubled or backward areas . 
in general , the exemptions fall in 70 major categories , subdivided into 259 entries , 52 conditions and 7 lists , each containing many elements . 
exemptions invite abuse . 
for a certain sum , officials located at the bottom of the hierarchy , who have considerable discretion in the application of conditions , can be persuaded to give favorable interpretations . 
the products taxed at high rates ( for example , polished granite ) are sold as products taxed at lower rates ( for example , as unpolished granite ) . 
fraud of excise taxes is more contagious than tax fraud on profits and incomes . 
if a company fraud excise duty and the tax rate is high compared to pre-tax profit margins in the industry , its competitors also have to cheat , just to be able to survive . 
while the fraud increases , governments levy of rights " additional " or " special " incite greater fraud . 
perceptions of direct taxes also suffer . 
the bribe paid to the excise tax for a favorable classification , the difference between the value of polished and unpolished granite , and the omission of true revenues create " black " funds , which cannot be declared on income-tax returns . 
in addition to weaken the ability of the state to provide essential public goods , schemes to escape indirect taxes also discourage businesses to adopt more productive technologies , which requires technologies involving a large-scale deployment . 
but as indirect taxes can be more easily circumvented by deploying several small units instead of one large unit , it is impossible to achieve economies of scale . 
it is important to note that in the software industry , where all the units are exempt from indirect taxes , indian companies operate on a scale effective . 
india could mimic the example of china , a country in which the rationalization of indirect taxes in 1994 has prepared the ground for a great boom ? 
or the coalition governments in a vigorous democracy incapable of such a reform ? 
last year , the government led by the bjp india has enacted legislation authorizing sharp reductions in the budget deficit . 
it then appointed a working group to make the necessary changes to bring to the policies of public spending and tax policies . 
in july , the working group has proposed to increase taxes ( rather than reduce spending ) by removing the majority indirect tax exemptions , among other things . 
the new government led by the congress of india also seems to promote these proposals . 
if congress and the opposition parties follow , they will help much to support the country 's economic growth and to dispel the idea that democracies cannot take the necessary measures to encourage development . 
what is the problem with turkey ? 
on december 16 , orhan pamuk , one of turkey 's most famous writers , will face a court in istanbul . it must respond to the charge of " insulting the national identity " to be voted in favour of an open discussion of the turkish genocide of 1,5 million armenians in 1915 and 1916 . 
pamuk faces three years in prison . 
turkey 's efforts to impose fines and prison sentences to those who toe the official line convinces me that i was right to oppose the opening of negotiations on the country 's accession to the european union . 
in december 1999 , the european council granted turkey candidate status of the eu , which meant that turkey will enter the union at a future date has not yet set . 
then the council asked the european commission to decide before october 2004 if turkey met the necessary political criteria for membership , which include democracy , the rule of law and respect the right of ethnic minorities . 
this decision has been one of the last taken by the commission of romano prodi , of which i was a member . 
among its 30 members , 29 said that turkey had fulfilled the criteria sufficiently to be able to continue . 
i was the lone dissenter . 
this is the report of the commission on turkey , prepared by g√ºnter verheugen , then in charge of the enlargement of the eu , which has driven my decision . 
this report mentioned that in 2003 some 21 , 870 turks have asked for asylum in the eu , of which 2 127 have been accepted . 
in other words , the eu governments themselves acknowledged in 2003 that the turkish government had persecuted over 2 000 of its own citizens . 
in the meantime , the commission published a progress report on turkey believing that reforms were continuing , although at a slower pace , under the mildly islamic-minded government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan . 
this report was nevertheless state serious doubts : human rights violations , including torture , continued ; the military 's influence remained too high ; freedom of expression was not universally observed ; non-muslim religious and cultural minorities were victims of discrimination and violence against women was not sufficiently strong opposition . 
the situation has not changed much since accession talks began in october . 
beyond the persecution pamuk is currently the victim , the unacceptable behaviour abound . 
in march 2005 , the police violently intervened in a demonstration marking international women 's day . 
in may , the largest teaching union has been banned for having supported the education of 14 million kurds in turkey in their own language . 
it is undeniable that intolerance reached to the heights of the turkish government . 
foreign minister abdullah gul has recently cancelled sharply a press conference in copenhagen when he spotted a kurdish journalist in the audience that the danes have refused to get out . 
such acts and attitudes amply justify my disagreement in october 2004 . 
but even if these shortcomings were corrected , turkey should not be admitted to the eu , because this is not a european country . 
christianity , feudalism , the renaissance , the lights , democracy and industrialization have made us what we europeans are , but they have not made turks what they are . 
so i am not convinced that reforms in turkey implemented at the insistence of the european commission would continue after accession . 
i suspect that there will be backsliding . 
in addition , turkey 's accession would surely to that of ukraine , belarus and moldova , and perhaps of georgia , armenia and azerbaijan . 
the first three of these countries are certainly more european than turkey . 
leaving aside the three caucasus republics but including the successor states to yugoslavia , this would give an eu of some 35 members . 
what kind of union would that be ? 
the eu is not simply a club of friends . 
it is based on freedom of movement of goods , services , capital and people . 
the commission as guardian of the union treaties , must protect these four fundamental freedoms , which means that it must sometimes persuade , and if necessary force , member states to change their laws . 
the policies on alcohol in sweden , the volkswagen-law in germany , and discrimination against foreign investment funds in france are examples of cases that have made the commission unpopular . 
but they were necessary . 
by the time i left the commission , i was sitting on a pile of 1 , 500 of irregularities of this style . 
in short , eu accession means accepting incisive measures that deeply affect the internal affairs of a state . 
it will be impossible with such disparate members . 
the eu would fall victim to what the historian paul kennedy calls " imperial overreach . " 
it is unacceptably diluted . 
it is for this reason that the former french president val√©ry giscard d 'estaing feared that the entry of turkey does not lead to the end of the eu , and that is why the former german chancellor helmut schmidt said : " the accession of turkey would be more than the eu could bear . " 
but the strongest reason to oppose turkey 's accession is a question of democracy : the majority of the eu population simply does not want it . 
the crisis in bolivia , failure of latin america 
bolivia is not a typical latin american country , far from it . 
and if haiti , this would be the poorest country in the western hemisphere : it is even less stable that haiti as the shows its history and its two hundred coups since independence . 
in a region with a strong indigenous past but at present fragmented and isolated , bolivia is , perhaps , with guatemala , the only country in latin america where indigenous peoples represent the majority of the population . 
its topography and ethnic distribution generate autonomist and even secessionist forces that threaten national unity in a much more provocative than elsewhere . 
and this is , of course , with paraguay , the only country in the whole subcontinent denied access to the sea . 
thus , it would be imprudent to extrapolate bolivia 's current crisis to the rest of latin america . 
it is too simplistic : elsewhere , the institutions are much stronger , poverty , and particularly the misery , has been reduced and the struggles of ownership of natural resources have generally been settled . 
even in countries such as venezuela , which has huge oil reserves and is equipped with a nationalist government in mind traditional , the status quo had enabled the preservation of foreign investment for nearly eight years of government of president hugo chavez . 
even if the existence of indigenous movements is a reality in many countries , since the state of chiapas to " araucania , " from the amazon to ayacucho , they have never posed no real threat to national integrity in any country in latin america . 
thus , bolivia is not a premonitory crisis , not more than the eternal " domino theory , " to which both lyndon johnson and che guevara subscribed in the case of bolivia , seem valid or even partially reasonable . 
however , the current crisis in bolivia shows the finger at the " democratic deficit " that afflicts latin america . 
elected leaders have failure for one reason or another in bolivia , ecuador , and haiti . 
democracy is faulty or missing in cuba , mexico , and nicaragua , and it is threatened by one reason or another in venezuela and colombia . 
none of these cases are identical to the other , and they include varying degrees of risk , destruction and reconciliation . 
it remains to be seen what can be done against this state of affairs , which contrasts starkly with the encouraging outlook that prevailed until recent years . 
at the last meeting of the organization of american states held in fort lauderdale , florida , the delegation of the united states took a good idea by others and were simply by its support . 
the story began two years earlier when dante caputo , former argentine foreign minister , and the united nations development programme ( undp ) were in charge of preparing a report on democracy in latin america . 
they concluded that an early warning system for democratic crises in the region would help generate some actions before any loss of control , as is the case of bolivia today . 
caputo and the team then convinced chilean president ricardo lagos , take care of the initiative and to promote it with several of his colleagues . 
what he has done without the initiative did not get very far . 
in fact , the undp report on democracy in latin america , published in 2004 , barely mentioned it . 
the united states and the new secretary general of the oas , jose miguel insulza , have relaunched at the oas meeting in florida , but it was killed by latin americans " reasonable fears convinced that this is an action against venezuela , associated with the latin americans " anachronistic fears on the violation of the sacred principle of not speech . 
despite the continent 's failure to agree on the principle , the idea of an early warning system should be studied . 
today , the latin american community has probably little possibility of intervention on the situation in bolivia , and yet it is dangerous for everyone . 
evo morales , the leader of the opposition and planters coca leaves , is perhaps a honest , if misguided , democratic leader , but his supporters are all available to any desire authoritarian ? 
hugo chavez may not be financing morales and bolivia 's other dissidents , but venezuela and cuba are not tempted to meddle in the affairs of the country where che guevara died the head of the guerrilla nearly 40 years ago ? 
the business community of santa cruz in bolivia may not give following his threats of secession , but they share the reserves of oil and natural gas in their region with the indigenous highland peoples rather than with brazilian industrialists of s√£o paulo ? 
before events reached extreme , it may be right that the oas ( not the united states ) to get involved . 
the region continues to need this participation , in terms of time , message and proper democratic platform , separate from the traditional us intervention and latin america 's traditional indifference . 
the decline in france ? 
the french are notoriously sensitive , not to say on the defensive , about france 's stature abroad . 
the french state spends a significant sum to the spread of the language and french culture , but the french are painfully aware that the global position of their country is not what it was . 
in this context , it is not surprising , therefore , that during the last presidential election , the publication of a report by the european commission saying france 's economic rank among european countries was past the 3 
the oecd and eurostat , the european body in charge of these data , thought they put an end to this aspect of the debate by demonstrating that france , germany , italy and britain were all living standards roughly equal per capita . 
but the broader controversy has not disappeared . 
worried talk about the " french decline " reappeared with the street protests this year against pension reform , mounting disputes over fiscal policy with the european commission and bickering with america on the war in iraq . 
the best-selling non-fiction book that wins a great success in france at the moment is a polemic written by nicolas baverez , france , which falls . 
baverez 's book is filled with quotes from de gaulle and napoleon . 
according to the author , france 's last great achievements date back to the 1970s , with the fast train , the tgv , and airbus . 
he castigates mitterrand and chirac for a " common talent to win the elections and make france a loser . " 
the book 's success is itself a sign of " malaise . " 
but what kind ? 
baverez 's evidence of degeneration is not as convincing as he believes . 
for example , he cites the exhaustion of industrial jobs as the most glaring evidence of the decline of france . 
but deindustrialization is common to all advanced countries . 
indeed , france does in fact better results than most of its rich competitors neighbours and , unlike germany , the uk , or the us , has retained the same global market share in the industrial sector that it had in the early 1970s . 
moreover , according to a more accurate measure of competitiveness and foreign investment , france does excellent results in these areas . 
according to a recent report published by the council of economic analysis , direct investment in france rose to 60 billion euros in 2001 , almost twice that of germany . 
french cost competitiveness is also improved ( 20 % ) in the last three decades , higher productivity counterbalancing the rapid growth of wages . 
but the heart of the economic problems in the long term of france lies precisely in fear of losing industrial jobs . 
france remains a strong industrial power in traditional areas such as automotive and aerospace industries , but it has fallen behind in innovative markets , where smaller companies spread new technologies . 
france , for example , spends only $ 30 billion per year in research and development of advanced technologies , compared with $ 51 billion in germany , $ 98 billion in japan and $ 265 billion in the united states . 
in short , baverez 's analysis in the wrong direction . 
france has undertaken several critically important reforms over the past two decades : economic and financial liberalization , the elimination of price and foreign exchange controls , the end of credit restrictions , european liberalisation , reducing inflation and trade deficits , the advent of the euro and the forced globalization of companies in the country . 
the french malaise has certainly not been induced by these reforms . 
france 's problem is that it has failed to recognize the new world of which it is already part . 
the french capitalism is dead , and france fails to accept its disappearance . 
france must be the only country in which a prime minister , lionel jospin , felt forced to apologise after having said on television that " the state is not omnipotent . " 
there are many reasons for this french schizophrenia , but the most important of them is the politics of the past 20 years . 
until 1981 , france was clearly divided between right and left . 
since this period , the administrations mitterrand and chirac blunted their ideological edge in order to implement the difficult process of adaptation to europe and globalization . 
a " shock therapy " to the srm . thatcher two decades ago would have been able to forge a new political consciousness . 
but the transition slow and consensual of reforms allowed the french to live in a world and think in another . 
this state of affairs explains in the political cataclysm that exploded during the last presidential campaign , when the far-right leader jean-marie le pen has reached the second round of presidential elections before the outgoing prime minister , lionel jospin . 
the rise of the extreme left , which gathered 10 % of the vote during this presidential campaign , also attests to this political failure . 
france needs a political revolution more than an economic revolution if it is to come to accept the reality , including the fact that the french " decline " is a fear of the french people . 
the value of european values 
european leaders have revived the constitutional talks that had ended last december in a dispute on voting rights . 
these debates are , of course , lead to compromise , which cannot delay . 
still need to understand clearly what the goals are supposed to the constitution . 
two fundamental principles have chaired european integration : solidarity and subsidiarity . 
these two principles lie at the crossroads of philosophy , politics , economics , sociology and law . 
for years they have been an integral part of the legal and institutional framework of the european union , in the treaties , in the charter of fundamental rights ( which quotes them in the preamble ) and in the recent draft constitution . 
in short , they are included in history and the ideals of the eu . 
but what is the real significance of these two principles ? 
consider solidarity , which is open to at least two interpretations : static solidarity , which concerns only the distribution of income and wealth , and the broader concept of dynamic solidarity , which concerns the production of income and wealth . 
in the postwar history of european integration , dynamic solidarity was strong in the first period , that of the european coal and steel , both in its economic development strategy ( reconstruction ) and in the treaties , particularly the treaty of rome . 
this does not mean that dynamic solidarity was subsequently suppressed : european monetary union , for example , perfectly encapsulates this principle . 
thus , although some countries did not immediately benefited from the euro , they nevertheless accepted because they were convinced that it would have positive effects on the long term . 
in other words , the dynamic solidarity means encouraging policies that encourage investment , innovation , economic growth and employment . 
however , as indicated in gdp growth in the eu , dynamic solidarity has been shaken in the last decade . 
the gap between research and development is particularly worrying . 
the implementation of the so-called lisbon strategy of the eu , adopted in 2000 with the promise of creating the world 's most competitive economy , is threatened by a growing emphasis on static solidarity , reflected in high social welfare costs and high taxes needed to its funding . 
the primacy of static solidarity is due to an aging population , which , along with slower growth , has led to structural fiscal imbalances . 
one of the biggest challenges for the future of the eu is to deal with the current prevalence of static solidarity , which is geared towards the elderly , to the detriment of the dynamic solidarity , which promotes the young . 
after all , the union cannot allow current consumption to continue to prevail on the investment needed in the future prosperity . 
subsidiarity is similar to the concept of solidarity in that its interpretation is also twofold : the subsidiarity vertical and horizontal subsidiarity . 
vertical subsidiarity concerns the distribution of power between the various levels of government and sovereignty : the eu , national states , regions and municipalities . 
the best-known application of this principle is federalism . 
the european treaties clearly express this subsidiarity vertical . 
but is this enough to encompass the emerging institutional and constitutional settings of the union ? 
horizontal subsidiarity concerns the responsibility and the freedom of human beings , as well as social and economic powers . 
it encompasses the relations between the state , society and the market . 
but the company and the market have their own rights and their own sovereignties that are not granted by the state . 
so the problem comes following : how to ensure the autonomy of each realm ? 
an example of horizontal subsidiarity the internal european market , which has created a new kind of economic freedom and increased competition between companies by eliminating the protection that national governments were offering . 
horizontal subsidiarity means that in society and in the economic sphere , the state cannot violate individual freedom and responsibility , that must be met at the highest possible level . 
it also means that a " higher power " must support every time that individual freedom and responsibility are not enough to achieve the objectives necessary for human dignity . 
this support , however , should be implemented in ways that promote the natural potential of individuals , society , and the market . 
but this is only possible if the role of horizontal subsidiarity is clear , which has not been the case in the european treaties , the charter of fundamental rights , or the work of the european convention . 
in short , solidarity now involves a redistribution rather than growth ( which is how the current generation expresses solidarity with future generations ) while the subsidiarity is the distribution of political power , rather than a prudent definition of the boundaries between the state , civil society and the market . 
today , these two values are defined to promote the state . 
indeed , the emphasis on growth oriented towards the market has often been identified with the semi-alien values of america . 
but these values are deeply ingrained in europe and they need to be uprooted again . 
the eu must restore its economic vitality by pursuing a model of solidarity and subsidiarity more balanced in favour of the market and society , which reduces the state 's socio-economic influence . 
the public institutions must produce public goods ( such as defence , justice and fiscal and monetary policy ) , the company must offer social goods ( such as culture , education and support for needy ) , and the market must produce economic goods ( linked with profits , growth and employment ) . 
in the 21st century , europe must review the value of these two principles ( solidarity and subsidiarity ) if it wants to achieve integration 's historic goal : freedom and welfare required to overcome the differences and political divisions that led to the tragedy in the 20th century . 
that is the spirit in which the european constitution must be written . 
the politics of values 
the debate on the american elections has still not abated . 
how president george w. bush , he was able to get three million votes more than senator john kerry , and , in addition , to offer a republican majority in both houses of congress ? 
there is little on the answers , but two themes recur in many explanations . 
one is personality . 
at a time of uncertainty and threat , people have put their trust in a president they knew rather than in a candidate has not yet proved its worth . 
the second is that of values . 
people voted for a set of values rather than for specific policies . 
indeed , some ( it is said ) agreed with the policies of mr kerry but nevertheless gave their votes to mr bush , because they felt " comfortable " with the whole of his attitude . 
it is clear that the united states are now deeply divided in electoral terms . 
an arch of blue states ( democrats ) to the east , north and west spans a huge red ( republican ) area in the centre and the south . 
beyond the geographical division , the divisions are reproduced at the local level . 
the gerrymandering , this practice drawing of electoral boundaries to promote a political party at the expense of another , is no longer necessary . 
voters tend to move in regions where the majority of people share their values , whether republican or democratic . 
what exactly are these values ? 
these are the values that deal , that we said , " god , guns , and gays . " 
religion plays a role , including the literal truth of the bible in the area of the story of the creation . 
the possession of a weapon is the ultimate test of individualism and the use of weapons in a time of war is not abhorrent . 
gays and other " modern " practices are rejected as self-indulgent . 
as the political scientist andrew hacker recently put it , " the candidacy of mr bush has been built to form a majority in giving 60 million voters the chance to feel good about themselves . " 
is all this an american phenomenon , or there are other trends elsewhere ? 
one answer is that as of american phenomenon , the politics of values may command a majority now , but it is by no means general . 
europe and other regions of the world are equally divided . 
the personality account without doubt , and under the obvious political differences may also be issues of values which have not yet been brought to light . 
however , traditional political differences based on the disagreement over fundamental values play a role always less important in the elections . 
the prime minister , tony blair , for example , another leading to face an election in his country , plays the personality card and talks about policies , but is above all a set of middle-class values . 
when he speaks of " modernisation " or " to enter the 21st century , " he manages to suggest a strange but appealing mixture of change and stability . 
this leaves the conservative opposition without an effective response . 
even the issues of tax cuts and asylum stricter fail to fly on the ropes of the melody of the values that the republican party has managed to be heard in the united states . 
the situation is the same in germany , where the influence of the politics of values is even smaller . 
the debate , in germany , is still largely a policy debate . 
when the opposition offers the government negotiate the reform of social protection or , more recently , to combat unemployment , the underlying challenge is not posed in terms competence rather than values . 
yet , in the fields of political debate english or german , or elsewhere in europe , the clash of values threaten . 
the parties are fighting for those who can " feel comfortable in their own place " , but they may not fully realize that this is only partly a matter of policy . 
religion will never be an important factor in european politics : opinion polls show that the religious practice remains one of the few major differences between the americans and europeans . 
guns also have a different place in the minds of europe : it is their absence that europeans see as important . 
europe also live , without doubt , a pacifist streak of values . 
and the issue of political correctness ( " gays " ) also plays a role in europe . 
above all , europe itself divides europeans , as the " national question " is present in all european states . 
it is a question of values , inspired by fear . 
people want to know where they belong , and in the process turning against the united states and to europe or against europe and to their own countries . 
all ways , we leave the realms of policies , and even politics and enter the murky domain of symbols and myths . 
which , in any case , is the main risk that democracies face , because the policy of values is a dangerous development . 
it reintroduces fundamental divisions of a society whose greatest democratic achievement was precisely to banish fundamentalism of political life . 
enlightened public debate must be a discussion on the policies contained by a community of values . 
it is therefore essential to insist on this important objective of the policy of freedom . 
the advent of the interest 
one swallow does not make the spring , and one month of normal job growth and rising prices in the united states does not mean that the federal reserve no longer fears economic malaise and deflation . 
but the time will come when world interest rates begin to rise , as central bankers are preparing to resist the wave of rising inflation . 
when that time comes , whether this fall , in 2005 or 2006 , or in 2007 , america and the global economy will face financial vulnerabilities that reflect the success of the past three years of monetary stimulus in arresting the decline in production and moderating unemployment . 
short-term interest rates are surprisingly low : only 2 % in the euro zone , just 1 % in the us , and zero in japan . 
the expansionary monetary policy has been a success , but only after pushing interest rates to historic lows and have convinced investors that borrowing costs will remain at their current levels for a long time . 
the monetary stimulus has mainly been to increase asset prices : everything that produced a benefit , a dividend or a rent becomes much more attractive , and so much more valuable in financial terms , when interest rates are very low and should stay . 
this explains the large gaps between current prices of real estate in the us , equities in new york , london and frankfurt , and long-term bonds around the world and what should be , conventionally , their core values . 
that will happen when central banks start to raise interest rates ? 
in 1994 , the increase in interest rates in the short term has led to an increase in long-term rates ( and lower prices long-term bonds ) to at least double that laid down by the standard models this year . 
interest rates on developing peripheral economies have also risen much more than the rates of the main advanced industrial countries . 
the first danger for 2005 and for years to come , when global interest rates rise , as is likely , is another wave of financial crises of emerging markets . 
for countries such as mexico , brazil , turkey , argentina , korea , malaysia and thailand , the record of the 1990s shows that interest-rate spreads can grow and capital flows reverse remarkably quickly , regardless of how favorably the representatives of the imf and analyses by major banks view a country 's policies . 
interest-rate spreads of emerging markets are currently abnormally low . 
international money flows , aside from inflows into the us , are not yet at levels associated with a " irrational exuberance , " but there is unlikely to happen before interest rates start to rise . 
this is an alarming prospect , because if there is a lesson to learn of the 1990s , it is that nobody should overestimate the stability of international financial flows . 
the second danger comes from the high asset values in the main advanced industrial countries . 
the dominant mode of thought within the federal reserve , which i fully support , argues that the revolution of information technologies continues , that potential production in the united states is growing always very quickly and that the output gap is thus relatively wide . 
this implies that interest rates will certainly remain low for a considerable time . 
in addition , the trust in the federal reserve is high , and the last remnants of the premium of the risk of inflation of the 1970s wrung out of interest rates . 
therefore , even after output levels income to their potential , interest rates will remain low by the standards of the 1980s and 1990s . 
all of this is , of course , good news for all those who hold assets such as bonds on the long term , equities and property . 
indeed , the rising prices of active on the long term was precisely what aspired lowering interest rates : making bondholders and especially homeowners richer , after all , provides a boost to spending . 
but the bad news is that even if interest rates are expected to remain low for some time , they will not stay as low indefinitely . 
the important thing is that when interest rates rise , asset values will fall . 
it is during these periods , and particularly when asset values fall quickly and significantly , that we discover the full level of competence of our central bankers in their main task : reducing financial volatility and promoting economic stability . 
it is also during these periods that we discover how individuals who hold long-term bonds , real estate , or stocks have not because they think that the current prices are attractive relative to basis , but because their prices have risen in recent years . 
it is a crucial issue for policy makers , because those who have bought long-term assets because the price seemed to increase indefinitely are also those who will sell as soon as the trends seem to be reversing . 
in particular , the us trade deficit heralds a mass instability in cases where the asset prices in the long term should fall significantly . 
it is certain that the challenges facing the world 's economic policy makers over the years will be different from those that they have faced since the collapse of the illusion of the nasdaq . 
the risks associated with inflation are probably less dangerous than those generated by a fall in production and the threat of deflation . 
but , as we learned during the 1990s , this does not mean that the challenges of the future will be easier to solve . 
the futures opposed america 
i have recently discovered an interesting fact : economists american international finance and macroeconomists americans who are caring for the domestic economy have very different points of view -- in fact , opposed -- on the possible consequences of the huge current-account deficit . 
international finance economists see a financial crisis is possible , followed by a painful and perhaps prolonged recession in the united states . 
macroeconomists which deal with the domestic economy instead see a next fall in the value of the dollar not as a crisis , but as an opportunity to accelerate growth . 
macroeconomists look at the situation as follows : at some point in the future , foreign central banks will be less willing to continue their massive purchases of dollar-denominated securities in order to support the greenback . 
when they will end their programmes to purchase of dollar on a large scale , the value of the dollar will fall , and it will fall sharply . 
and , from that point of view , if the value of the dollar declines , american exports will become more attractive to foreign markets and american employment will resume , labor being redirected to the new export sector . 
the situation will be comparable to that of britain when it abandoned its exchange-rate peg and allowed the pound depreciate by the german mark , or what happened in the united states at the end of the 1980s when the dollar depreciated against the pound , the mark and -- especially -- the japanese yen . 
international finance economists describe a far bleaker future . 
they see the end of the programmes of buying dollar on a large scale by central banks will not only the decline of the dollar , but also to a spike in us long-term interest rates , which will curb consumption spending immediately and throttle investment spending after a short period of time . 
certainly , international finance economists consider also that american exports will take advantage of the dollar 's decline , but the lags in demand are such that the surge in exports will be only one or two years after the decline in consumption and investment spending . 
eight to 10 million people will have to shift of the services sector and construction into the import and export goods , implying that structural unemployment will rise . 
in addition , there may be a financial panic : the large financial institutions with short-term obligations , and long-term assets will have difficulties to bear a strong increase in long-term interest rates denominated in dollars . 
this factor of inequality can lead to some financial stress and bankruptcy just as easily as crises caused during the mexican and east asia in the 1990s or the crisis argentina this decade the fact of assets in local currency and obligations in dollar that held the banks . 
when international finance economists put forward this scenario , macroeconomists specialising in the domestic economy their respond that it sounds like a case of incompetence in monetary policy . 
why should the federal reserve allow the rise of long-term interest rates when foreign central banks will cease their programmes to purchase of dollar ? 
should it not so intervene and take over by the purchase of long-term us treasury bonds , thereby keeping long-term interest rates at a satisfactory level to full employment ? 
international finance economists usually respond that the federal reserve does not have the capacity to do so . 
when forced to choose between the full employment and price stability , according to them , the federal reserve will choose price stability , because its institutional memory of the 1970s and the soaring inflation remains very strong . 
therefore , since a fall in the value of the dollar is pushing the import prices and that functions as a negative shock on the supply side in the economic sector , the federal reserve will have to raise , not lower interest rates , and sell , rather than buy bonds . 
serious economists that i respect enormously find themselves to take a position on opposite sides of this debate . 
i am not wise enough to give reason to one or the other , but i certainly know what side i hope is wrong . 
the poor students of europe 
in the united states , the states that follow unsound fiscal policies are penalised . 
their bonds sell at a discount relative to those of other states managed . 
the higher debt service that they must pay serves , to a degree , disciplinary action against the temptation to spend now and pay later . 
of course , the discipline of the market is not perfect : the bond market does not " see " not really implicit future liabilities ( as promised pension payments ) . 
however , the application of fiscal discipline , combined with internal budgetary process in every state , has prevented the large scale state-level fiscal crisis from occurring in the united states since the great depression . 
consider the case of europe . 
before the advent of the euro , many states of southern europe were feeling the fiscal crises , producing waves of high inflation . 
but with the introduction of the single currency , the road to solving a fiscal crisis by inflation has been closed , as the european central bank ( ecb ) oversees monetary policy . 
however , even if the nations can no longer count on inflation to solve the imbalance of their finances , the single currency allows them to use the debt capacity which belongs to other members of the european union to extend their wasteful and postpone political accountability for periods of leave the good temps . 
it is to avoid the possibility that the eu has created the stability and growth pact : the budget deficit of governments must not exceed 3 % of gdp . 
last week , the german government , formerly the european countries most prudent and disciplined at the level of taxation , broke the rules of the pact for the fifth consecutive year , without ( much ) apology . 
finance minister peer steinbrueck has indicated that he expected the european commission applies sanctions against germany : the credibility of the pact would , he said , be in jeopardy if no action were taken . 
thus , germany would not block sanctions this time , as was the case there are two and a half years . 
but steinbrueck also made it clear that he expects a purely symbolic sanctions in response to the budget deficit representative 3,4 % of gdp , not penalties that would have a real cost to the government or its economy . 
the stability and growth pact is not , or not yet , on the way to work as scheduled at the outset . 
what about the discipline of the market ? 
the german government 's willingness to increase its debt and run bigger deficits limited by the fact that the market recognises and penalizes nations that allow their fiscal positions to weaken ? 
in a word , no . 
the interest rates on sovereign debt in euro twelve eurozone governments are very similar . 
so the market does not seem to care that countries have different potentials to generate exports to fund the financial flows needed for debt repayments , or different current and projected debt-to-gdp ratios . 
willem buiter of the university of amsterdam and anne sibert , of the university of london believe that it is the acceptance of the ecb to all the deficit of the euro zone as a guarantee that has undermined the market 's willingness to become the supervisor of fiscal prudence . 
as long as the marginal piece of german debt is used as collateral for a short-term loan or as the centerpiece of a repurchase agreement to acquire liquidity , its value is much more likely to be determined by the terms under which the ecb accepts it as guarantee that by its fundamentals . 
the ecb 's treatment of all such debt as important source of liquidity reserves now trumps any analysis of differences in long-term sovereign risk . 
it is dangerous in the long term . 
it is necessary to have both market discipline and sound fiscal management to have a reasonable chance to benefit from a price stability in the long term . 
omettez today to sanction by the market a behavior that may become reckless or the institutional levers that give a voice to future generations , and you run serious consequences -- perhaps not today or tomorrow , but one day , and for the rest of your life . 
as time passes , the arrival of the single currency and the way that the euro has been put in place generate more and more unease . 
the policy of the euro zone is too deflationary . 
the transfers necessary to make the currency bearable to regions that are slowing down or are already in recession when the ecb tightens policy are not facts . 
the institutional foundations for a stable long-run fiscal policy are being eroded . 
now , buiter sibert and convince us that the ecb is giving the market less opportunity to reward the thrifty and penalize the profligate than it should . 
the earth is not moving again , and it will not happen before a moment . 
but the ground under the euro could well become slippery if things do not change . 
milosevic and hussein : even trial , same farce 
trials of war criminals were once serious business . 
remember the photographs of herman him and rudolf hess , claims , and on the dock at nuremberg . 
some nazi leaders have even been hanged after relatively short but fair trials . 
nowadays , the trial of the leaders of the world are the most despicable become farce . 
the trial of saddam hussein and his baath friends are an ongoing series of embarrassments . 
the defendants try one antic after another and hussein shows all forms of contempt possible . the only thing that it has not yet made , is to show the judge . 
it is difficult to expect an outcome that could appear legitimate in the eyes of iraqis or the world . 
meanwhile , the trial of slobodan milosevic has changed in funeral after four boring years of testimony and $ 200 million spent unnecessarily . 
in cambodia , the united nations and the government have stalled for nearly ten years about how to bring surviving khmer rouge figures before the courts . 
the mass killers who took power in the twentieth century were sentenced to be killed in popular revolts or tried for their crimes -- at least , if they did not die in their mandate . 
who can be proud that romania 's last communist boss , nicolae ceausescu , and his wife were shot without even the semblance of a fair trial ? 
the formal trappings of a real court always seem preferable to instant justice , even if the end result is also the death . 
today there are two plausible ways to proceed against a deposed tyrant . 
a nation can send its former leaders in the courts , as the argentines did in the 1980s with the generals responsible for the disappearance of more than 5 000 of their fellow citizens . 
at international level , the nuremberg model remains valid to serve as an example to other trials , although under the dubious conditions that victorious powers sometimes of auditors for certain crimes , such as " crimes against humanity , " which are not properly defined at the time they are committed . 
there was a time when we could see the benefits of both national and international trials . 
the trial on the national territory allowed the local community to give vent to his grief by participating closely to the procedure . 
as judges and juries , the defendant 's compatriots could also bring greater sensitivity to the estimate of guilt because they appreciated the harsh conditions under which a deposed dictator made its decisions . 
the trial of the generals in argentina has been a successful ritual in the framework of the painful transition from the military junta to democracy , but the experience ended with weeping self-doubt . 
even after their condemnation , the generals have been strong enough to demand a denunciation of the trials and then an amnesty for the next president . 
argentine politics is still embroiled in the legal consequences of these trials of 20 years ago . 
at international level , the decision of the un security council to establish the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia ( icty ) was also greeted with great confidence . 
the icc has taken several foundational decisions under the direction of antonio cassese . 
but then the judges had the misfortune to realise their dream the more expensive : judge the chief villain , slobodan milosevic . 
you cannot have a clear idea of how the serbs would have judged milosevic in a local trial . 
many would have depended on the political party that controlled the court . 
at international level , the fear was not in an excess of politics , but on an excess of law . 
milosevic 's trial had to be more than fair , it had to be the emblem of un justice . 
thus milosevic was allowed to defend himself -- serious error in terms of length and efficiency of the trial . 
there is no limit on the number of people that the prosecution called to testify on the same gruesome history of serbian aggression and brutality . 
it will take many months to determine the problem and know why this scandal a trial of four years . 
my hunch is that the court 's well-meaning officials were too influenced by the truth and reconciliation commission , south african model sold in schools of law as an alternative to retributive justice . 
during the trial south africans , the most important issue was not the future of the defendant but the past victims . 
each victim was encouraged to tell his story and the defendant listened . 
in the case of massacres in the twentieth century , such storytelling can last for decades . 
encouraging victims to speak and then give the defendant the right to filibuster the proceedings by touting its merits of political leader are the ingredients of a session interminable . 
one of the lessons we learned from the milosevic trial and hussein is that we should not judge of men or women to make them lose their charismatic appeal . 
they will turn the trial , particularly if they are allowed to defend themselves , and use the courtroom to justify their careers . 
tyrants should be tried that , after having been clearly defeated . 
ironically , the fact that the court of nuremberg has been driven by representatives of the victors and powerful was an advantage . 
they were a constant reminder to him , hess , and their henchmen that the allies were in charge , that the nazis were irreversibly defeated . 
punish the culprits , rather than shaping the way history would be written , has always been the clear objective of the trial . 
the tragedy of the milosevic trial and hussein is that the points on the " i " of history are still missing , and history itself is on the hot seat . 
the resulting hesitancy of responsible gave rise to procedures , both international and national , which facilitated fantasies of justification and return . 
in the case of saddam hussein , the fantasy could still happen . 
the dividing line of the iraqi economy 
all those who view iraq sees a nation divided between the communities of shi 'ites , sunnis and kurds . 
but there is an equally fundamental division , a division that as much contributing to the insurgency continues that sectarian strife and opposition to the american-led military occupation , that the widening gap between the rich and the poor in iraq . 
when iraq was released , the people , especially the poor , have to hope for a charismatic leader who would save the harsh realities of daily life . 
high in fear , they had no idea how democracy could apply to their society , or how the groups in defence of human rights and other civic organizations could help to shape their future . 
soon enough , iraq was faced with a new social divide . 
on one side were those who understood how to operate in a democracy , power and realize their ambitions . 
they learned to speak the language of democracy , to win at the same time , money and influence , and to ensure the contest independent organizations to defend their rights and privileges . 
on the other side , however , the vast population of iraqis without power , especially women widowed , divorced or abandoned without anyone to take them in charge , they and their children . 
for these people , democracy and human rights do not mean much . 
they are ignorant , poor and sick . 
victims of an education system that collapsed over ten years , they are not trained to find a job in the iraqi economy withering away . 
under the yoke of saddam , no effort was made to raise living standards for the poor . 
i have visited the huge slums of iraqis and found families living in homes barely covered with a roof , infestations of insects everywhere , with open sewers for seeping under their doors . 
day and night , they live in the dark . 
needing nothing less than food , decent housing and job prospects , these families wait for death , dreading the cries of their starving children . 
when i met the women who live in these homes , they have bombarded with questions : democracy allait-elle give them food and houses ? 
will democracy stop men to beat their wives ? 
will it give citizenship to their children ? 
will it give us the right to divorce the husbands who abandoned ? 
to all these questions , i replied " yes " . 
yes , democracy will give you the right to live in a decent house , the right to learn and work , and it will give citizenship to children and equality between men and women . 
but you have to work hard and make every effort to demand these rights . 
they replied : " saddam has taught us to be unemployed , silent , and fearful for 35 years . 
what can we do now ? " 
in these destitute areas , where most iraqis live , people are prey to bitter temptations . 
there are many people who are not on the scope of political or government leaders . 
they fall easily into violence , theft , and sabotage . 
poverty led some to accept money in exchange for terrorist acts , abetted by the promise of a false heroism that they could not exploit during saddam 's long reign . 
poverty has exacerbated the trauma of violent history of wars and atrocities of iraq , which has desensitized people to the assassination . 
although conditions in iraq today are drawing many young men towards violence , i am convinced that it is enough simply to provide them with decent jobs and housing for the save . 
jobs , in particular , will help young people to forge new lives through serious work . 
it must not use fake jobs to disguise an army of unemployed . 
we need to give people jobs that allow them to contribute positively to the reconstruction of the country . 
by nature , every individual seeks to prove useful for his own society . 
but the culture that saddam created convinced iraqis that political connections are the only way to gain authority , money , and knowledge . 
overcoming such sentiments will take time and a vibrant economy , which means that the new iraqi government must have limited powers in order to facilitate the growth of the private sector while encouraging widespread understanding of democracy and human rights . 
religious groups are ready to participate in this process . 
we can also rehabilitate the technocrats who served under saddam , so that they , too , have a chance to serve their country . 
last but not least , we must provide loans to poor families to help them build a respectable life . 
above all , the government must make every effort to convince poor iraqis of the value of democracy and freedom , and the importance of the constitution in achieving their aspirations for a better life . 
it will not be easy to achieve in a country where many people consider breaking the law is an act of heroism . 
but we iraqis , learned that power should not be concentrated in the hands of a minority , and that the implementation of justice requires combat corruption in all its forms . 
if the constitution is to operate as a guarantee of democracy , freedom and security , poor iraqis must learn to do their this fight . 
the islamic identity 
everywhere you look at the present time , islam is used ( and misused ) as a political force . 
some muslims use them as incentives to action ; many muslims in the west ( and in other countries ) perceive it as an " other " and a " containment exclusion . 
as a turk , i feel directly these two sides of the debate . 
the reason that islam is a religion of the " other " to western eyes is that the west has witnessed a systematic de-institutionalisation of religion . 
this is not the religion that has disappeared from modern western life , of course , but rather the claims that religious institutions can make on individual behavior . 
religion in the modern world is more personal and spiritual experience than ever before . 
however , a process of de-institutionalisation of religious experience is also taking place within islam . 
the politicisation of islam is displacing the authority of islam 's religious classes , the ulema . 
as in the west , islamic religious experience becomes more personal . 
the interpretation of religious texts by individual muslims , including political activists , intellectuals and women , is a consequence , among many others . 
there is also the dissemination of religious knowledge , the teachings of the koran being abused and taken out of context to support political objectives . 
who now decides what is legitimate and what is illegal in islam ? 
who has the authority to interpret religious texts ? 
who can issue a fatwa or declare " jihad " ? 
nowadays , activism and terrorism provide , or rather , a source of legitimacy . 
it is thus that lay people decide what does or does not mean islam , without the authority of religious schools and specialized training . 
indeed , islam today is primarily interpreted by political actors and cultural movements , not religious institutions . 
this de-institutionalisation has enabled islam to move the status of local and national social bond to creator imaginary ties between all muslims around the world who feel oppressed or displaced . 
thus , islamism can unite members who were deeply divided : sufis and muslims previously saints ; shia and sunni muslims ; conservative saudi arabia and iran revolutionary . 
islam is also dynamic , its believers leaving rural areas for cities , including the cities of the west . 
many see this movement as negative and point out that these people are socially uprooted and that they are shifting in alienation and , for some , terrorism . 
but social mobility is also a precondition for creating a modern outlook . 
of course , the migration is creating a sense of distance among muslims , if not a complete break , with their social origins . 
so their religious experience is new , deprived of theological , community , or state institutions . 
religious experience instead becomes a form of social imagination within which they reconstruct a sense of belonging to islam in an environment that is new and strange . 
this is not the distance from modern life , but the proximity to it that triggers a return to religious identity . 
indeed , the vast majority of radicalism is evident in the groups which , by their experience of mobility and displacement , are familiar with secular western ways of political thinking and urban living . 
confused by an unknown , these individuals are clinging to islam becomes their only support . 
but for that support works , islam must be liberated from its traditionally subservient attitude , passive and docile in the face of modernity . 
by wearing a veil or beard , claiming the right for places to pray at work or school and demanding special foods , muslims identify themselves openly as muslims . 
they are telling the world that they are more zealous and meticulous in their religious observance that individuals who confine their religiosity to privacy . 
for example , non-muslims usually see veiling as a sign of the debasement and inferiority of muslim women . 
shame , however , it has become for muslims a sign of their positive affirmation of an islamic identity . 
young muslim women in europe illustrate this transformation perfectly . 
girls who adopt the headscarf in french and german schools are closer in many aspects ( namely , the youth culture , awareness of fashion and the language ) , their classmates that their mothers uneducated who are forced to stay at home . 
in adopting the headscarf for the european public sphere , these girls are unwittingly the symbol and the role of muslim women . 
this trend goes well beyond headscarves . 
all western muslims possess a double sense of belonging , a double cultural capital . 
they define themselves by their religiosity , but they have also acquired universal , secular knowledge . 
the fact that they have a double cultural capital , they can move relatively freely between different activities and spaces ( home , school , houses of young and urban leisure space . 
being a muslim and being an islamist are two different things . 
we are seeing today is the change of a muslim identity to an islamic identity . 
the religious self for individual muslims is being shifted from the private to the public realm . 
the question for everyone is whether this quest for identity can be satisfied with headscarves and wide public acceptance of islamic religious practice , or if a positive affirmation of islam requires a more fundamental renunciation of modernity . 
a new era for islamic science ? 
for several hundred years , when the science and mathematics were enjoying a period of great invention , a region of the world stood out . 
the masters of these disciplines were revered there , medicine , and people are curious about the workings of nature . 
it is no surprise that this region was globally respected . 
in the other half of the known world , scientists were punished , even killed . 
mathematics , as irreligious and alien outlaws , and were later subservient to religion . 
the standard of living was low . 
the prosperous region was the islamic middle east , while an ignorant europe remained poor . 
the two regions were religiously governed ( historians disagree about the role and the nature of the religions in this context ) , but science flourished only in one of them . 
today , of course , the roles of the islamic middle east and the west are reversed . 
since the second world war , the united states are the world 's undisputed leader in the field of science . 
throughout this period , the brightest students were drawn outside their country of origin by the prospect of better career opportunities and research . 
until recently , more than half of students graduate in mathematics , science and engineering in the united states were born abroad . 
many of these talents stayed after of graduation , and both the industrial world that the government have benefited . 
meanwhile , islamic culture entered a historical phase in which science was equated to the influence of the west , and eschewed . 
even in countries where oil revenues could fuel a significant amount of research , arab leaders have not encouraged such investments , and the consequence is that their companies have not prospered as much as they might have . 
recently , a desire for greater political respect drove the islamic nations to invest in technology , which is most visible in the pakistani and iranian nuclear ambitions . 
but while such weapons have political weight , the science on which they is mundane and old . 
respect from incubating insights , rather than the born of past discoveries is much more significant . 
imagine the influence that would have a pakistani institute in the world leader in cancer research . 
and the political rhetoric shift if researchers in oman discovered a way to eliminate aids ? 
this opportunity is not for the moment . 
but there is another , which is not restricted to the islamic societies . 
the united states have committed serious missteps recently . 
" matters of faith " have been substituted to science in government , from the presidency . 
top researchers have seen their reports modified by political operatives when the facts contradicted the official version . 
encouraged by an administration influenced by religion , school systems are shifting their focus from science to " values . " 
since the terrorist attacks of september 2001 , entry visas are fewer and more difficult to obtain , which stops the flow of young talent to american universities . 
major scientific organizations have protested , without result . 
at the same time , tax laws have been revised to make investors more rich in the short term , discouraging long-term investment in research . 
half a trillion dollars has been spent on the war in iraq , an amount roughly equal to the funding of any basic research for the last thousand years . 
even if the united states avoids a fundamentalist dark age , they clearly risks losing their world domination in terms of research . 
japan has recognised the link between political clout and science in the 1980s . 
the main industrialist , akio morita , ceo of sony , and the right-wing politician shinzo , who have made a series of speeches that have been collected and published in 1986 under the title the japan that can say no ( japan that can say no ) . 
they have outlined a national strategy in which global influence flow from scientific leadership . 
the main idea is that military power could be made obsolete if the " food chain " of military technologies was controlled by other nations . 
the book 's title refers to japan 's plan to " say no " to the us military influence once japan controlled key military technologies . 
building a knowledge-based economy thanks oil wealth is entirely possible . 
for example , texas , as most of the southern states of the united states , was once economically poor and on the decline . 
even with oil revenue , the flow of dollars into the economy , by itself , does not boost prosperity as much as one might think . 
texas has therefore decided to devote the oil money to a funding for education . 
today , that endowment is roughly equal to that of harvard university , and it extends to 15 universities . 
the effect has been staggering : the aerospace industry has almost disappeared from california , but it explodes in texas . 
research centers and telecommunications consortia have rushed in texas , up canadian telecommunications giant nortel . 
although the industry in the us is in crisis , texas has one of the most solid industrial economies of the world . 
there is no reason that the same results cannot be achieved in the middle east . 
but above all , the islamic world must rediscover and with its proud heritage . 
the iranian debate on iraq 
no country in the middle east is monitoring the events of the postwar iraq as closely as iran . 
the geographical proximity , an intense and bloody history of war with saddam hussein 's iraq , religious and emotional connections with the shia from iraq , some concern about the united states and its policy in the region : these are the son that unite iran to its western neighbor . 
given ongoing tensions with america , iran is particularly concerned by the possibility of a continuing us presence in its neighbour , as well as by america 's dominant role in building the future of post-saddam iraq . 
outsiders may find it difficult to follow internal iranian debates , but they exist , they are intense , even if they are not always visible to the wider international public . 
you can reach three general approaches in the evolving iranian debate on post-saddam iraq . 
iranian pragmatists argue that iran will inevitably have to cooperate with the united states in post-saddam iraq , even if only to ensure that the rights of the shiite population of iraq are respected . 
for this reason , iran should win assurances that the new iraqi leader will not be hostile to it , and will seek friendly bilateral relations . 
other key considerations for the pragmatists include preserving iraq 's territorial integrity and the repatriation of tens of thousands of iraqi refugees living in iran . 
they are moderates who think that the iranian government should urge the united states to obtain the extradition of members of the mujahdin-e khalq organisation ( mko ) , as well as the total dismantling . 
in exchange , the iranian government should offer its support to ensure peace , stability and security in iraq . 
in sum , the pragmatists would limit us-iran relations , focusing on a programme that largely reflects iran 's domestic concerns . 
in general , the conservative forces of iran support this approach . 
another approach is proposing a more active role and cooperative for iran in the reconstruction of iraq . 
defenders of this position argue that iran is well placed to facilitate the reconstruction , because of its well-established infrastructure of personal and institutional ties with iraq . 
finally , we think , the united states and the international community will recognize the value of iranian cooperation . 
iranian cooperation should be rewarded by the dismantling of the mko infrastructure in iraq , perhaps in exchange for an iranian commitment to address the activities of al qaeda , as well as to expel members of al qaeda to iran . 
above all , iran should ask americans to respond to its cooperation with the assurance of a guarantee in return that iran does not become the target of american military action . 
in short , the defenders of cooperation call for an open market and explicit : iran 's support for stability during the current phase of transition as well as its commitment to maintain cooperation relations with all permanent government emerges in iraq , in exchange for the improvement of the regional and international position of iran . 
this position is widely shared among iran 's reformers , within and outside the government , as well as by the technocratic class and business is more international . 
finally , for iran 's radicals , the possibility of cooperation with the united states is pure fantasy . 
they are convinced that america is bent on undermining iran 's security and endanger its national interests . 
according to the radicals , the united states will at the very least seek to impose significant changes in iranian foreign policy . 
at worst , they argue , america will seek to impose regime change in iran in an active way . 
it will actively work against the acquisition of nuclear knowledge and energy by iran and could even try to weaken the military capacity of iran in its entirety . 
the radicals perceive the american invasion of iraq as a reflection of america 's desire to encircle iran . 
in return , they believe that iran must take an aggressive stance in defending its interests , forming strategic alliances with russia and other regional powers , and using iranian influence in iraq to prevent the formation of a government pro-american and anti-iranian in baghdad . 
the hardliners on all sides support this approach . 
the overthrow of saddam 's regime was the easy part of the iraqi crisis . 
now comes the hard part : establish peace and security , win the war against terrorism and convince the muslim masses that america has no intention of occupying iraq , siphoning off its oil resources and redesign the middle east to its image . 
meanwhile , the opposition against the united states , under the expression of suicide bombing or other forms of terrorism , will likely increase . 
iran is intended to keep its dominant position in the region , thanks to his dynamism policy and its muslim identity resonate widely in the muslim world . 
what happens in iraq has major implications in iran and the united states would do well to find a way to recognise this . 
american threats , or discussions on another war , fuel the fire of resentment and frustration in iran , strengthening the most radical forces . 
if the united states want to avoid such effects , they must agree to limit the influence of its own radicals , recognizing that america 's interests in iraq are best served by a cooperation with iran . 
a way for iraq 
the situation in iraq has come at a point where everyone ostensibly wants the same thing : the departure of coalition forces . 
the recent disclosure of a confidential memorandum from britain 's ministry of defense on troop withdrawal stress this aspiration . 
the only question is how to satisfy it . 
as long as the coalition forces will remain , the violence will only increase . 
however , if they leave , the escalation of violence will take place when even , and even more quickly . 
the real question is , how come in iraq to organise an army and a police force who can be trusted to respect the law and order . 
there is still a long way to approach this goal . 
despite the courage of many iraqis who join the ranks of the army or the police , it is not surprising that some have motives person less than pure . 
in northern iraq , one rule of old accounts and ethnic segregation is introduced in certain areas traditionally mixed , as irbil . 
in other regions , sharia law is imposed . 
how can iraq create body likely to enforce the law with efficiency and impartiality , regardless of ethnicity , religion or gender ? 
the traditional answer is to recruit , train , and instill the " good values . " 
but time is short . 
we need to find other ways . 
in the absence of a deeply instilled value system , iraq needs associations anchored in civil society , to which the police and army to auditors . 
they could take different forms , but the most important is that they are truly extended at local level , and that they have the support of the district , the region and the country when they highlight abuses . 
if a local surveillance is put in place , supplemented and recognised at the national level , then most of the members of the military and police forces probably will behave appropriately , and otherwise , it will be easier to identify and manage them . 
such measures can appear excessively optimistic , and yet , in afghanistan , a country like iraq in many ways , many groups are working together . 
the cooperation for peace and unity ( cpau ) provides a model of how to operate . 
in afghanistan , as in iraq , the priority of ordinary people , has been to reduce violence . 
cpau worked throughout the country over the past three years to put in place of the committees of peace at the level of districts , supported by satellite peace councils in the villages . 
this initiative faces a culture in which violence is so deeply embedded as children , at a time , learned arithmetic counting the soviet soldiers dead . 
the committees have therefore tried to bring together all sections of the community , including teachers , tribal leaders , religious leaders , women , the police , judges and businessmen , to develop ways to resolve conflicts without violence . 
even if the committees was not officially a supervisory role to date ( it is planned for the future ) , the simple fact that the police , army , and justice to be part of it is in contact with the rest of the community , provides feedback , and helps to build trust . 
some results are remarkable . 
in a workshop , the local military commander has come to spend a few hours by courtesy , and ended up staying for the whole week . 
it is party in apologizing for his violent past and is committed to disarm his private army of 2,000 men . 
it makes today regularly visit the committee offices . 
in iraq , projects such as the humanitarian liaison center in kirkuk are starting to fulfil a monitoring function by offering the ethnically diverse local population the opportunity to expose grievances and get help to resolve its problems . 
but , too often , even in the case of a trial , the judgment is not applied because of intimidation . 
the us and british forces have already well worked to strengthen civil society . 
however , we do not hear about the workshops for women 's empowerment , or the success of the organisation of local elections on a small scale in the country . 
mobilise civil society is a huge challenge , particularly when , as in iraq , this must be done quickly and on a large scale . 
the military forces remain necessary , but so that the incentives to disarm , who can take the form of prospects of economic opportunities more successful than the crime and the flight . 
fortunately , such an organisation of civil society is as cheap as it is important . 
the humanitarian liaison center kirkuk at an annual cost of $ 75,000 . 
with $ 10 million , you could put in place a hundred centres of the same kind , and it would remain of the currency . 
it is now to engage in this direction , without fail support the brave people who ask the challenge of power to account . 
otherwise , the iraqi people may not know the security it desperately needs after so many years of suffering . 
democracy on the nile ? 
the surprise decision by egyptian president hosni mubarak to propose a constitutional amendment allowing the direct and competitive presidential elections could very well be a giant step for democracy in egypt and in the arab world . 
westerners accustomed to a pluralist democracy can be difficult to understand what a potentially huge shift this decision will result in a country accustomed to military rule for more than 50 years . 
under the current system , egyptian citizens can only show up on the day of a presidential referendum every six years to say yes or no to the only name on the presidential ballot . 
this explains why someone such as mubarak has always received more than 90 % of the vote , albeit in the middle of indifferent turnout . 
syrian and iraqi strongmen have done even better with this system , probably because they demanded that the names and addresses of voters to be placed at the bottom of each ballot . 
many people have long argued that democratization in the middle east will not move until egypt is fully engaged in the process . 
egypt could not truly engage on a path of democratization without first amend its constitution , that in order to reduce the pharaonic powers of its president and limit the length of his term . 
mubarak , after all , is already in his 24th year as president . 
thus , his announcement of competitive presidential elections is an important first step . 
the regime may assume that it will be able to use the process to its advantage , but events may prove more difficult to control once people begin to feel empowered . 
the democratic genie is out of the bottle . 
in any case , egypt is not the only country in this troubled region embarking on the path to democracy . 
turkey on one side of the middle east and morocco on the other are already well in this process . 
the real groundswell this time seems to have come from the close timing and results of the recent elections in iraq , palestine , and to a lesser degree in saudi arabia . 
the unprecedented demonstrations against the occupation of lebanon by syria following the assassination of his former prime minister rafiq al-hariri , do not seem to recede . 
egyptian opposition groups have also held increasingly bold marches and other forms of civil disobedience in recent weeks . 
the catalyst for their anger was the arrest and detention of the ailing opposition leader ayman nour , at the end of january . 
the government 's heavy-handed behavior reinvigorated the national movement " kifaya " ( enough ) , which has demanded an end to the mubarak regime . 
suddenly the popular wisdom that egyptians are passive and afraid to act did not seem to be check . 
an alliance of local , regional , and international forces is uniting against tyranny permanent exerted on the banks of the nile . 
the recent wave of popular pressure seems to have shaken the regime . 
only a month ago , mubarak dismissed demands of constitutional reform as " futile " . 
but , whatever combination of events that led this reversal , the initiative on the elections must be welcomed . 
it is a necessary first step , although it is not enough to rewrite the egypt 's stagnant political system . 
egyptians are already wary of symbolic reforms to the country in which tunisian president zine el abidin bin ali created a caricature of a constitutional amendment that appeared to open the door for competitive presidential elections , but which was subsequently resulted in a sham contest with a few handpicked " opponents . 
in previous tunisian presidential referenda , bin ali routinely received 99 % of the vote ; he now got 96 % . 
let us hope that mubarak is more serious about electoral reform . 
to prove his sincerity , it needs to order the immediate release of ayman nour and take steps to end the state of emergency , which prevents the successful organisation of political campaigns . 
mubarak must also approve a limit of two consecutive terms of five years for each president . 
just as necessary , measures to gain the trust of the people , including open and equal access to the media , which are now controlled by the state . 
i announced that i intend to contest the presidential election to come to open up the debate on these essential reforms . 
but i would gladly go back to my life as a private citizen when i have the assurance of a free and open election this autumn . 
if they are seriously implemented , these steps will transform mubarak 's legacy . 
with events in lebanon , iraq and palestine , they could very well inaugurate an arab spring of freedom , waited for a long time . 
historic elections in egypt ? 
egyptians go to the polls on 7 september to elect a president among 10 candidates , including hosni mubarak , in power for 24 years . 
if little doubt that it will be re-elected to the outcome of the election , many in follow the steps with passion . 
some 6,000 national election observers have been trained for the occasion , and hundreds of international observers will arrive in the country this week . 
although all the trappings of a real electoral contest are in place , it is striking that several signs of authenticity are missing . 
despite promises to the contrary , the conditions of play are far from being fair . 
mubarak has a disproportionate number of benefits : name recognition , a near-monopoly of electronic media controlled by the state and nothing less than 85 % of the print media . 
a week before the election , some opposition candidates have not yet had the opportunity to disseminate one campaign on egyptian television . 
all the members of the presidential election commission are appointed by mubarak , and the new election rules eliminated all competitors independent . 
since 2000 , a decision by the supreme court says that the 8,000 judges egyptians must supervise the elections and certify the results . 
it is a major step toward fairer elections , as the judges " professional union has remained fairly independent over the past half-century of executive power grabs . 
so the mubarak regime has had to use various ploys to neutralize the union of judges . 
one of them was to stretch the definition of " the judiciary " to include thousands of employees graduates in law , without experience to the court but loyal to the government . this leaves little room for the true judges , because if they protest in boycotting their work , the task will come back once more to police the infamous ministry of the interior . 
thus , in the past , the union of judges has done its job , with predictable results . 
in the 2000 parliamentary elections , while mubarak 's ruling party has received that approximately 38 % of the vote in areas controlled by the real judges , the results have managed to peak at 86 % when the quasi-judges were the observation . 
this year promises to be very different . 
in the spring , the judges have held a nation-wide assembly and resolved that unless the government granted them full independence , and exclusive oversight of the process of elections , they would not supervise the presidential ballot ( or parliamentary ) to come . 
on 2 september , they made their final requirement : allow civil society groups to observe the conduct of the elections , stop change the definition of legitimate judges in an election , and agree that no ballot box will leave the presence of a legitimate judge without its contents are counted , certified and postponed . 
for the moment it appears that the situation , as the head of the presidential election commission announced publicly on egyptian television that he refuses any comment by the citizens of the conduct of the elections . 
among the interesting developments on the eve of the election , is a fierce public debate on the subject : should boycott the election or go out and vote ? 
many opposition parties have called on their members to abstain for protest against restrictive election rules that strongly favor mubarak . 
moreover , the muslim brotherhood , regarded as the single strongest opposition group of the weight in egypt , are urging their supporters to vote according to their conscience but not to support any " despotic and corrupt . " 
this is a clear if implicit repudiation of mubarak , only head of state for 24 years . 
some 34 civil society organisations preparing thousands of young egyptians to monitor the elections despite repeated governmental objections . 
these groups argue that if the regime does not intend to rig the elections , even the presence of national and international observers should not be a problem . 
the response from the regime is to say that any outside monitoring is interference in egyptian sovereignty , and that national observers are an affront to the integrity of the judges . 
that argument was quickly undermined when the union of judges spoke in favour of observers of civil society . 
that frightens the mubarak regime is the voice of the interior and the challenges to hold free and fair elections , or is simply incapable of removing the party of cheating as she became intrinsic to its operation , the present signs do not bode well for next wednesday 's polls . 
in the meantime , for the first time the egyptians are exciting experience of tyranny , and take advantage of a whole new area of freedom . 
the envy of european dollar 
currencies can play a key role not only in commercial transactions , but also in the diplomatic and political wrangling . 
when this happens , commercial transactions become more difficult and subject to greater uncertainty . 
the politicization of money during the interwar depression was economically devastating . 
but violent currency wars took place more recently . 
during the 1960s , the international monetary order became the subject of a political tug-of-war . 
each side had quite different theories and explanations of on the situation . 
the europeans , especially the french , complained about what general charles de gaulle called " exorbitant privilege " of the us dollar . 
the general and his monetary guru , jacques rueff , argued that the us used the dollar 's status as a major reserve currency of the exchange rate regime of the bretton woods fixed in order to run deficits and pay for their overseas military adventurism ( at this time in vietnam ) . 
france responded by calling for monetary reform that would end the particular role of the dollar and tried to revive the largely discredited gold standard . 
the europeans began a long discussion of the advantages of monetary union , which would allow them to compete with the dollar . 
but from the american point of view , the international role of the dollar was a trap . 
other countries could change their exchange rates , and thus could maintain greater competition at the level of exports . 
the us government was powerless in the face of an undervalued yen , fueling the belief that the rest of the world used the dollar to attack america 's manufacturing base . 
the nixon administration has concluded that the only way to save the american economy was to engage in monetary unilateralism ( a monetary expansion so dramatic that other countries would be forced to adjust their exchange rates ) . 
these long-forgotten battles seem suddenly very present again . 
the world no longer has a fixed exchange rate regime , but the dollar remains the major reserve currency , a sort of floating bretton woods . 
for americans , the reserve role of the dollar is a potential threat while for non-americans , rather , it is another example of an american neo-imperial quest for hegemony . 
during this decade , china has taken the place of japan in the 1960s , preventing its exchange rate to rise in order to push export growth . 
this has been the target of us complaints about unfair competition , and efforts to impose an adjustment of exchange rates that would deter americans to buy toys , appliances and clothing chinese . 
american manufacturers have estimated that chinese-made bras constitute the american way of life . 
in the meantime , europeans ( especially the french ) complain about the huge deficits americans and de gaulle 's argument that the rest of the world is paying for the wars of america is back in fashion . 
some europeans suggest that asian central banks should hold a greater part of their reserves in euros , an echo of the general 's unsuccessful attempt to capitulate america in selling dollars for gold . 
the 1960s ended by a collapse of the " system " and by major financial turbulence , accompanied by an inflationary surge of commodity prices . 
everyone was hit and america 's role on the world stage has been shaken . 
a similar collapse at the moment should have a rather different effect . 
the floating-rate system of today is more stable and the adjustment costs distributed differently . 
the majority of americans do not suffer a lot of the dollar 's sharp fall because foreign sellers have to make adjustments prices for the american market . 
asian economies are growing vigorously and their central banks their rely on the united states . 
they should continue this policy not to see their export sectors to suffer a sudden setback on the american market capital . 
the united states will have more time to deal with a current account deficit that is unsustainable in the long term . 
the economically dynamic regions of the world ( north america and asia ) are linked by a pact that will ensure the continuity of the centrality of the us dollar . 
americans will continue to pile up debt because asians encourage them to do it . 
the repeal of the pact would be contrary to the interests of both parties . 
it is not an american unilateralism because the pact involves collaboration with asia . 
but for the europeans , who are excluded from the pact , it looks like monetary and economic unilateralism . 
in the meantime , the rise of the euro against the dollar suffered european industrial exporters . 
europe does not , however , able to relieve . 
indeed , europe will be the biggest victim of the new currency clashes . 
the responses predicted in the 1960s ( restoration of the gold standard or the invention of a common european currency ) seem more very useful . 
a single currency has not allowed to provide substantial protection . 
the old version of the european response ( what psychologists call " dollar envy " ) will only become more acute . 
the european central bank will be invited to extend the monetary base , as if the imitation of the dollar was the answer to all the industrial , structural , and demographic problems plaguing europe . 
but we should remember that europe 's problems do not come from currency manipulation . 
the protests against the new version of america 's exorbitant monetary privilege must be seen for what they are : a way to compensate for a real european powerlessness . 
so dollar envy is ready to end , and it is getting tougher , the international value of the dollar disappearing without any obviously bad effects on people who print and use it . 
an epidemic of policy 
the americans , as citizens of all the countries of the world , have come to accept the fact that the policy plays an important role in the appointment of certain kinds of public officials . 
few of us are surprised ( although some may be disappointed ) when a federal judge or a senior diplomat is appointed because he has managed a crucial test of loyalty to an important principle in the eyes of the party of the president or the prime minister . 
but science , in the view of all , occupies a special place and on this point , the united states is beginning to stand as a cautionary example for the rest of the world . 
scientific appointments must be based on objective criteria of training , competence and performance . 
clearly , it is legitimate to interrogate a future secretary of health and human services ( hhs ) on his views on abortion . 
but it is entirely out of appointees to sit in the scientific advisory committees to tests of political loyalty . 
similarly , membership of bodies examining the proposals scientists , a process that is fundamental to scientific progress , surely ought to be free of all the barriers that are unrelated to professional qualifications . 
unfortunately , scientists in the us are faced increasingly often these barriers . 
during the autumn of last year , the journal science has published several reporting on the issue . 
one was on the wholesale replacement of members of the advisory committee of the national center for environmental health , which is part of the center for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , without consulting the center 's director . 
similar cases have also been observed in the advisory committee on lead poisoning and prevention , the cdc 's advisory committee on national human research protections , and the advisory committee on genetic testing . 
the current epidemic of ideology , in which the advisory committees are dissolved and reassembled with new members , and candidates are subjected to loyalty tests , seems outdated to some observers . 
the representatives of the hhs referred to it as a " fairly standard practice . " 
it is not a practice in america , or at least not until today . 
in all cases , the fact that the bush administration examines the candidates for key positions in order to determine their compatibility with its " values " is not really worrying . 
the most alarming development is on the level of importance of ideological investigations , which interfere in areas hitherto immune to this kind of manipulation . 
indeed , the most revealing in this political epidemic has perhaps a membership to the study section at the national institute of occupational safety and health , which assesses the subsidies to the study of the injuries occurred in the workplace . 
the advisory committees could be vulnerable to an occasional overhaul of this kind in the past . 
after all , they have recommended the policies that politicians will take into account . 
but study sections ? 
in october 2002 , science has published an editorial by david michaels and several of his colleagues . 
several of them were distinguished former officials who participated in some of the relevant committees and they brought a valuable perspective to the question , based on their personal experience . 
their article was a story in itself , but the consequences it had was even more interesting . 
it has unleashed a volley of letters in which scientists told of similar experiences . 
a muscular dystrophy research coordinating committee of the national institute of health told that an investigation had been conducted on it by a member of the white house . 
after having been asked about her views on various policies of the bush administration , none of them had to do with the work of the committee , she was asked whether she supports the president 's policy on embryonic stem cells . 
other person to be , a distinguished professor of psychiatry and psychology , reported receiving a call from the white house about his appointment to the national council on drug abuse . 
the caller said he had to do an investigation him to " determine whether his views could embarrass the president . " 
according to the professor , a series of questions followed , the representative of the white house keeping a rating . 
example : " you got two on three ; the president opposes needle exchange ( for intravenous drug users ) for moral reasons , regardless of the outcome . " 
then the conversation took a turn even more alarming . 
the official asked the nominee if he had voted for bush , and , having received a negative response , he asked : " why did you not supported president ? " 
this attitude is akin to a dictatorship , and not a democracy . 
the aim of scientific advisory committees is to provide advice , thoughtful in the political process . 
there is nothing to gain and much to lose , when a desired policy outcome is put forward . 
that is why the determination of research projects to support has always been a matter for objective peer review , not politicians . 
in fact , the law that applies here ( the law on the federal advisory committees , the federal advisory committee act ) requires explicitly that committees be impartial and " not inappropriately influenced by the appointing authority . " 
us secretary of health and human services tommy thompson and the white house personnel office should set an example to the rest of the world . 
they can do so very easily : within the law . 
murder in moscow 
it is time to put an end to the fiction that the " dictatorship of law " of vladimir putin has made postcommunist russia a less lawless . 
the murder of anna politkovskaya , one of the best journalists and most courageous of russia , a woman who dared to expose the brutal murders committed by russian soldiers in chechnya , is the ultimate proof that president putin leads a dictatorship with the usual contempt of the law . 
it is time for the rest of the world to recognise this , particularly for europe . 
the german ministry of foreign affairs is preparing a policy on relations between russia and germany , which should enshrine indifference to the lack of respect for the law shown by putin as national interest of the most powerful member of the european union . 
but indifference becomes the conciliation when it encourages putin to continue on this path in the international arena , as his current campaign to strangle georgia 's economy . 
the murder of politkovskaya has a sinister taste vu : just as in the heyday of the kgb , in putin 's russia people simply disappear . 
the murder of politkovskaya is the third murder apparently policy in three weeks . 
enver ziganshin , the chief engineer of bp russia , was shot to death in irkutsk on september 30 . 
andrei kozlov , the deputy governor of russia 's central bank who was leading a campaign against financial fraud , was assassinated on september 14 . 
the fact that russia 's prosecutor general yuri chaika investigation into the murder of politkovskaya in hand , as he has done for that of kozlov , is not a source of hope , as would be the case in a true democracy if a senior in an investigation . 
in fact , the involvement of the highest levels of government in russia is almost a guarantee that the killers will never be found . 
politkovskaya 's murder is a particularly grim augury when you consider the fact that she was making criticism of russia 's president . 
in her articles for one of the few remaining independent papers in moscow , novaya gazeta , and in his books " putin 's russia : life in a failing democracy " and " a dirty war : a russian reporter in chechnya , " politkovskaya wrote the suppression of freedoms that sign putin 's presidency . 
as the fate of the old men of media tycoons boris berezovsky and vladimir gusinky , and the oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky , the fate of the enemies of putin can take three forms : the exile , the prison , or the grave . 
i am not accusing the government of putin ordered the murder of politkovskaya . 
after all , as investigative journalist in campaign , she made many other people in addition to putin , including the current prime minister of chechnya , ramzan kadyrov is not least , whom she accused of a policy of kidnapping for ransom . 
but even if vladimir putin 's associates had nothing to do with the murder by ball of politkovskaya in an elevator of her apartment building in the centre of moscow , his contempt of the law created the climate in which the murder was carried out . 
the image of the murder of thomas beckett in its canterbury cathedral many centuries ago , the crime was committed in the clear conviction that the king would be satisfied . 
given what politkovskaya represented - the responsibility of a democratic press to question the kremlin and its policies - the government would have had to ensure that nothing bad happened to her . 
putin 's russia has already lost 12 prominent journalists , murdered during the last six years . 
none of these crimes has been solved , which would not be the case if the " dictatorship of law " putin was something other than a mere public relations strategy . 
the six years since the arrival of vladimir putin , the kremlin has been marked by deeply conflicting signals . 
on one hand , the world sees a young , educated leader pledging to modernize russia , particularly to align the application of the law and legal practices on the international standards . 
on the other hand , president merely while his former colleagues in russia 's fsb security service ( the former kgb ) provide not those who are murdered , and launch a series of notorious espionage cases against journalists , scientists and environmental activists . 
among these " neo-spies " include journalist gregory pasko , arms control expert igor sutyagin , diplomat valentin moiseyev , physicist valentin danilov , and others . 
the supposedly civilizing influence of being a western partner , chairing a g-8 summit in st. petersburg , for example , seems to count for nothing on putin 's kremlin cabal . 
once again , the contact with the values of the west has given another potemkin village ; russia presents a fa√ßade of laws and rules democratic , but behind that cardboard are the same arbitrary brutes law . 
at a global level , the danger is that lawlessness shown by putin exports . 
near the russian border , a form of criminalized diplomacy is taking root . 
think about how putin tried to rig the elections in ukraine , and the allegations constantly brought against the opposition leader yulia tymoshenko . 
look at the rogue breakaway regions in moldova , and in georgia , which exist only because they have the support of the kremlin . 
watch as the kremlin seeks to blackmail its neighbours in threatening their energy supplies . 
all the police know that when you ignore the behaviour of criminals , they grow bolder . 
it is high time that the world to recognize vladimir putin for what it is : a man who is taking russia back into the shadows . 
the world must now ponder this old latin phrase which tacet consentere videtur : who does not say a word agrees , and ask if it is wise to quietly consent to putin 's construction of a superpower energy where the law does not count . 
a gas pipeline to strengthen the empire of russia 
gerhard schroeder , who less than a month , was still german chancellor , has agreed to become chairman of the company to the construction of a gas pipeline from russia to germany through the baltic sea and western europe . 
in many countries , schroeder would accused of the crime of conflict of interest . 
his apparent moral failure is magnified by the fact that , at the same time , russia is threatening to cut off gas supplies to ukraine if it does not give in to the pricing demands of gazprom , the gas giant state ownership of the kremlin . 
the strategic objective of russia is obvious . currently , ukraine 's gas also means that a good part of europe as well , because most of the major pipelines crossing ukraine . 
bypassing ukraine , poland , and of course , the baltic states , the new pipeline will strengthen the influence of the kremlin , which seeks to reassert itself in the region . 
president vladimir putin and his government of ex-kgb clones will no longer have to worry about western europe when they decide how hard to pressure on russia 's postcommunist neighbors . 
should europe really give putin of such a weapon imperialist ? 
worse still , russia must use this weapon to put the eu to its boot of energy ? 
a former german chancellor takes the direction of the company that will provide russia the way to manipulate the european economy shows europe 's dangerous complacency in the face of putin 's neo-imperialist ambitions . 
of course , the russian media are aware of the growing dependence of europe by reports on russian energy . 
they go up to revel . columnists russians have written " when we have integrated and increase our energy trade with europe , will keep silent on the issue of human rights . " 
putin expresses this stance in a more oblique committing to pursue what he calls a " policy of independence . " 
so , does he want to simply say that russia must remain " independent " of the concerns of western democracies on ethics and human rights . 
it may be that some european leaders really do believe that maintaining the prosperity of the eu justifies remain silent on the issue of human rights and other issues that annoy the kremlin . 
of course , we must speak up , briefly on the " commercial " issues , such as the expropriation of yukos . however , if the kremlin on our values or our critical to her -- as in , say , bloodstained chechnya -- europeans seem willing to silence rather than face the possibility of higher energy prices , or even a blockade as that now facing ukraine . 
even as putin reorganizing itself his court , subjecting the duma to his will , the hopes of the eu to see russia become increasingly " european " should be abandoned . 
russia that putin is building evolved . it has shifted its post-soviet hopes of freedom to become an oil and gas bulwark for the new ex-kgb elite . 
indeed , matthias warnig , the director of the pipeline consortium chaired by schr√∂der , is a long-time friend of putin . 
a little earlier in the year , the wall street journal revealed that warnig , the director dresdner bank 's russian arm , is an officer of the stasi , the former secret police of east germany , and that he met putin at the end of the 1980s when the russian president was kgb spy in the gdr . 
that the russians to accept a government of ex-kgb men , for whom the lack of compassion and the refusal of dissent are the norm , reflects their exhaustion towards the tumult of the last 20 years . 
now , the kremlin believes that what is good for the russians is also for the citizens of independent nations . no mercy will be given to the smaller countries low once russia will hold the means to intimidate , isolate and threaten them with energy blockade . 
as a former head of state of the new independent lithuania , i have often been faced with such threats . 
the european union has signed numerous agreements with russia , including on a " common space " for freedom and justice . 
the kremlin is very strong to pretend such idealism . 
its control of eastern europe has always been imposed on the basis of " friendship treaties , " and the soviet invasions of hungary in 1956 and czechoslovakia in 1968 were " fraternal " missions . 
but look how putin abuses that " common " space : barbaric treatment of chechens , the imprisonment of the businessman mikhail khodorkovsky , the harassment of foreign ngos and yuliya tymoshenko , a co-leader of last year 's orange revolution , by the russian military judges on trumped-up charges . 
if europeans believe sincerely in their common area of human rights and freedoms , they must recognize that these values are not shared by the calculating placemen of putin . 
the same goes for what is to view russia as an ally in the fight against terrorism . 
is it really conceivable that the homeland of the " red terror " of countless unpunished crimes of the soviet era and traces of blood of lithuanians to caucasians can really help to combat the global threat brandished by iran and north korea ? 
it seems more likely that the kremlin 's cold minds will merely exploit every crisis to increase their destructive power and influence . 
for decades , the region of europe has been left to the mercy of evil . 
that is why i cannot remain silent when europe stumbles blindly into a new appeasement . 
we , the new democracies of eastern europe , have learned from our history that behind every diplomatic act of russia lurks imperial ambition . 
western europeans , who have forgotten this story , should take into account our warnings . 
the dependence on russia -- even if it takes the face of the so-called " charismatic " gerhard schroeder -- can only lead to the wall . 
iraq : bullets against the ballots 
when the war in iraq began in 2003 , the bush administration had ambitious plans : the image of post-1945 germany and japan , a long and peaceful occupation was envisaged , during which the increase in oil production would ensure a growing prosperity in the same time as democratic structures were built piece by piece . 
the foundation was to be a liberal , even post-modern constitution , with a guarantee of 25 percent of parliamentary seats for women . 
the current iraq , there is no peace and prosperity . 
the constitution that must be voted on october 15th includes that 25 % rule , but has nothing liberal . 
the key provision ( article 2 ) that no law can contradict " the undisputed laws of islam " violates the basic principles of parliamentary sovereignty , and will prevent the legislation from meeting international standards . 
for example , the age of sexual consent for girls cannot be high above nine , because muhammad himself had a wife of nine years . 
it follows that nine-year-old girls are also adults in criminal law , and subject to the death penalty for , for example , converting to another religion . 
the shia can use this clause to place their ayatollahs over the elected parliament , as in iran , because only they are allowed to determine the " rules " of islam . 
foreigners and the few iraqi liberals worry particularly about this islamic provision , but the opposition to the constitution , widespread among sunnis , aims to other provisions : the exclusion of the " saddamist ba 'ath party " of political life and the government , and the federalist provisions that grant autonomy to the 18 iraqi provinces and allow them to combine in regional governments . 
the law of exclusion is a personal issue for elite sunnis , who include thousands of businessmen , professionals , even artists , who , with few exceptions , they were all ba 'ath members . 
in theory , the constitutional prohibition might not be retroactive . 
but in practice administrative rules are now being applied to exclude the baath members of the so-called " high-ranking " of any form of government employment , regards thousands of people . 
the sunnis would probably accept the federalist provisions if they applied only to the kurds . 
they know that the alternative is not a return to centralism , but the secession of three provinces to kurdish majority of dahuk , arbil , and as sulaymaniyah to form an independent kurdistan , with its own ministry of finance , army ( the pesh merga ) , and oil production around kirkuk , the second-largest reserves in iraq . 
sunnis reject the same federalism for shiites because they see them as fellow arabs who have always accepted sunni rule in the past , and will do so again , unless they have their own government . 
that is what the new constitution would allow , because the provinces in the south - which have the main iraqi oil supplies - to shiite majority could form their own regional government . 
in the usual style of the middle east , disappointed sunni leaders , unhappy with the constitution , now threaten violence . 
but federalism is not the only reason why the supporters of the sunni supremacy and islamists launch deadly attacks . 
their opposition is more basic : they do not accept the principle of democratic government by the majority . 
instead , they seek to restore the rule of the sunni minority . 
for the islamists , all shiites deserve death anyway , as apostates . 
a shiite leader moqtada sadr , also vehemently opposes federalism . 
his supporters , largely illiterate , the poorest and most violent shias in baghdad 's slums and beyond , whose " mahdi militia " fought american troops in 2004 , even while the americans were protecting the shia sunni attacks . 
as a young priest draws its authority to his father , a populist dead ayatollah himself , sadr is opposed to the ayatollahs iraqis living , which despise his ignorance and violence . 
sadr absolutely cannot compete with them in terms of religious authority , so he takes an arab-nationalist stance against them , often recalling that the highest shia cleric , ayatollah sistani , is not an arab persia . 
in the same way , it reminds his followers that the el hakim , who head the supreme council for the islamic revolution in iraq ( sciri ) and their " badr " militia were subsidized exiles in iran , many of whom fought on the iranian side during the long and bitter iran-iraq war , until the americans " brought them back . " 
sadr opposes federalism because a shia regional government would obey his enemies , sistani and the sciri , and , he says , would fall under the aegis of iran . 
to underline his message , sadr sent his men to fight the badr militia , with success in baghdad , where the mahdis are many , but not in najaf , where sadr is hated after the destruction caused last year until his men were massacred by the americans . 
it was difficult enough to deal with sadr the bandit . now , a simple political calculation suggests he will probably be the main character to decide the outcome of the vote of the constitution in october . 
to reject the constitution and trigger new elections for a constitutional assembly , opponents need a two-thirds majority in at least three provinces . 
the sunnis are only likely to win in two provinces , but if sadr ordered his followers in baghdad 's slums to vote not with local sunnis , that will probably fall the capital in the hands of opponents of the constitution and ensuring its defeat . 
as a political thug , sadr is , of course , to sell . 
last year he was wanted for murder . 
now he wants recognition as a statesman , money , and , at least implicitly , sistani 's and the sciri 's humiliation . 
he might receive proposals , and negotiations may have already begun . 
but some of the shia he attacks with words and bullets have thousands of armed men at their disposal and for them , it deserves that bullets . 
the end of the secret 
transparency is not always an easy in the new democracies of eastern europe . this is what has discovered the hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany , when a recording in which he confessed the lies of his government has triggered riots . 
like hungary , post-communist romania has tried to encourage openness and honesty in a society which was once one of the world 's most closed . 
but the persistence of a culture of secrecy blew up corruption and abuses of power . 
there are , however , a real trend towards transparency , evolution recognised by the european union , which has given the green light to romania for membership at the beginning of the year 2007 . 
in addition to the establishment of what the eu is today for a " functioning market economy , " the essential reforms in the political and legal , that i have the burden , will the strengthening of transparency and control of the funding of political parties to the reorganisation of the judicial system . 
the judicial reforms contribute to root out corruption . 
ministers and former ministers , members of parliament , prosecutors , lawyers , and the members of the police , customs and other public bodies , as well as the heads of private companies , have been indicted . 
in addition , new forms have been developed for the statements of assets and financial interests by people in official position in government , parliament , public and local administration , and in the judicial system . 
the new declarations are the most detailed in europe and , above all , they are made public . 
the progress of romania are confirmed in a report published this month , according to which the people of eastern europe now have access to government information just as much as those of the established democracies . 
the report , transparency and silence , the open society justice initiative ( available on www.justiceinitiative.org ) , indicates that the new democracies are sometimes better than the old : some more romanian government bodies respond to requests for information of citizens that their counterparts french or spanish . 
specifically , 60 % of applications are met in romania , against 31 % in france and 24 % in spain . 
among the other good pupils include peru and mexico , two countries that have adopted legislation on the freedom of information in 2002 , shortly after romania . 
however , it is not always easier access to sensitive information in democracies in transition . 
i worked as a lawyer for the defence of human rights in the helsinki committee romanian , and we have often had to resort to the courts to force disclosure of information , according to the romanian law of 2001 to the freedom of information . 
for example , when we have officially obtained access to data on the telephone tapping authorised by the prosecutor general , it has simply ignored this decision . 
we have attacked the civil , and the judge has set a fine for every day of delay in the flow of information . 
it is only when the media were interested in the case , that the data - number of interceptions authorized over the previous ten years , people covered and duration of operations - have been made public . 
romania began to turn our backs on a past marked by the ubiquity of the securitate . 
i am now part of the government , and i realise that it is not always clear to share information with the public . 
but sometimes painful reforms are necessary . 
we would not have led to the economic and political reforms that will allow us to enter the eu without submit our policies to public scrutiny and accept the greater participation of citizens in the decision-making process that inevitably accompanies such openness . 
in fact , access to information has become a sine qua non of democracy around the world . 
when the united states adopted the freedom of information act in 1966 , they were the only ones , with sweden and finland . 
today , 65 countries have such legislation . 
in romania , those who fought for the adoption of a law on the freedom of information in take full party . 
according to the study of justice initiative , the people who come to the romanian government receive without any great difficulty of information that would have been unthinkable to communicate a few years ago . 
thus , the romanian defense ministry has disclosed the number of soldiers who died in 2003 , as well as the circumstances ( including 13 suicides , two deaths by ball , and two combat deaths in afghanistan ) . 
another example , the bucharest court has received a request for the number of judges is the subject of a disciplinary procedure since the beginning of the year 2000 , and the reasons possible sanctions . 
the tribunal has sent the request to the superior council of the judiciary , which has given a full response : four pages listing all the judges punished , the grounds and the measures taken . 
this process is both the result and the engine of the continuation of the reforms . 
the leaders have not always been very comfortable with the opening , and the battle continues for the most sensitive documents . 
but in the formerly communist countries , the benefits of transparency are undeniable . 
however , romania 's experience shows that official secrecy is always a threat , that no country is immune , and that only a vigilant can prevent it undermine the foundations of democracy . 
save the trees of life 
nobody can get through the day without using a by-product of the forest . 
to a greater extent than we normally believes , the paper on which you writing , water that comes out of our taps , the drugs that we are treating , the wood that our houses and furniture , all originate from the forest . 
forests provide the fresh air that we breathe and habitats of endangered species . 
they also provide us with recreational opportunities , which is becoming increasingly important in the complexity of our world . 
approximately 1,5 billion people living in the poor rural areas directly depend on forests for basic needs like food and firewood . 
yet deforestation continues . 
every year , we lose 14,6 million hectares of forest , or an area almost as big as four times switzerland . 
irresponsible forest management , enhanced by regulations and government bonds too weak , and the markets that reward illegal logging all conspire to deprive the world of its forests the most valuable and threatened . 
when the forests are beginning to disappear , a host of environmental , social and economic ills usually follow , affecting us all in one way or another . 
indonesia 's sumatra island is a good example . 
pulp and paper companies are driving a rampant and illegal destruction of forests that are home to the greater diversity of plants in the world . 
it is very likely that plants still unknown will disappear in the process as endangered species such as the rhinos and elephant , as well as the orangutan . 
when sumatra 's forests disappeared , entire communities will also be without proper place to live and no decent way to make their lives . 
in addition , the distortion that the trade in illegal products and cheap products needed to world markets is cause difficulties for responsible citizens . 
developing countries are losing $ 15 billion in tax revenues each year because of illegal logging . 
to make matters worse , the demand for wood for reconstruction following the tsunami of last year , has intensified a request already unsustainable on sumatra 's forests . 
the ponds in the amazon and the congo are the subject of similar threats . 
a recent study of the united nations , the millennium ecosystem assessment ( mea ) shows that the forests and other important areas are in serious decline due to mismanagement and will continue to disappear if serious measures are not put in place . 
information released by the brazilian government show that deforestation of the irreplaceable forests in the amazon , the fact of agricultural conversion , reached 2,6 million hectares last year , which is the total area of deforestation in the amazon to 17 % . 
but the battle against deforestation is not yet lost . 
various organisations , environmentalists and businesses worried about the state of the world 's forests are working together to reverse deforestation and improve the management of forests . 
so , for example , the world wildlife fund ( wwf ) and the world bank have helped the brazilian government to launch an initiative intended to establish new areas of forest protection over 17 million hectares in the form of national parks . 
the cooperation of the world wildlife fund and the world bank has also motivated partners to establish a trust fund to manage these protected areas in perpetuity . 
similarly , a meeting at the summit of leaders of the congo basin countries has enabled a cross-border cooperation on forest conservation and responsible management . 
all this has led to a $ 53 million initiative by the united states state department to promote congo forest conservation . 
since the first meeting of the leaders in 1999 , 3,5 million hectares of new protected areas have been organised in the congo basin . 
however , given the consequences of the asian tsunami last december , the weight of evidence provided by the mea and statistics on deforestation of the regions most critical , we must continue our efforts . 
the world bank and the wwf have recently promised to work for the reduction of 10 % of the global rate of deforestation for 2010 and work with the public and private sector institutions to allow ambitious achievements on forest conservation . 
wwf studies show that if the world 's forests are shared between different uses , including the protection of certain areas , the commercial management responsible and restoration forest landscapes , we can provide the world 's needs in forest products while maintaining important environmental and social values for the foreseeable future . 
business leaders , governments , civil society organisations must all play their role in achieving that vision . 
the saudis are fanatics ? 
the terrorist attacks in saudi arabia have led many to question the prospects of survival of the house of saud ruling and to consider the question of whether the kingdom is fundamentally dysfunctional and destructive or not . 
for one reason or another , it seems that saudi society has produced a stream of violent fanaticism that draws its inspiration from extreme religious orthodoxy . 
the fact that 15 of the 19 hijackers who took part in the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states were saudis crystallized a perception of the kingdom as a bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance . 
in some respects , this perception is fair , but it cannot be applied to the saudi population as a whole . 
on the contrary , it would be a serious mistake to assume that fanatical islamism fully defines saudi attitudes toward religion . 
between 2001 and 2003 , i was part of a team to achieve a large-scale study of values in saudi arabia , egypt , iran , and jordan . 
our results have produced a surprisingly nuanced picture of saudi attitudes . 
by comparison with respondents in the other countries of the middle east , saudis were less religious overall , and their attitudes toward democracy and arranged marriages also indicate a moderate undercurrent . 
it is true that in the four countries , religiosity is widespread , more than 90 % of respondents collectively that they believe in god , in life after death , and in heaven and hell . 
but the saudis appear to be less religious than their fellow muslims . 
sixty-two percent of saudis described themselves as religious , compared with 82 % of iranians , 85 % of jordanians , and 98 % of egyptians . 
americans also appear to be more religious than the saudis , with 81 % . 
this variation can be explained in part by cross-national differences on the meaning of the term " religiosity . " 
for example , the americans can define religiosity differently than countries of the middle east , perhaps with a weaker attachment to religious beliefs in islamic countries . 
this might also account in part of the differences between the muslim countries . 
but the gap between saudis , on one side and the iranians , jordanians and egyptians , another in the self-defined religiosity , is so great that it would challenge the widespread perception of saudi arabia as a highly conservative and religious . 
indeed , the actions speak louder than words : only 28 % of saudis have said that they were attending weekly religious services , against 27 % of iranians , 44 % of jordanians , 42 % of egyptians and 45 % of americans . 
these conclusions , although contrary to popular perceptions of saudi culture , are less surprising than they appear . 
sociologists of religion have long argued that in a monolithic religious environment , or when religious institutions are closely tied to the state , the overall religiosity of the population declines . 
it makes sense to think that when state authorities enforce strict codes of behavior , people tend to rebel and move away from officially sanctioned religious institutions . 
little wonder , then , that egyptians and jordanians , who live in countries where the state does not enforce piety , are more religious than iranians or the saudis , who must cope with the police local " virtue " backed by the state . 
even on the issue of marriage , many saudis expressed surprisingly liberal views . 
the respondents were nearly evenly split on the question of arranged marriages , half supporting the idea that marriage should be based on parental consent , while 48 % preferred love as the basis of marriage . 
given the segregation of the sexes and paternal dominance firmly anchored , this result appears to reveal a strong desire for greater individual choice in what has traditionally been a family decision . 
finally , the saudis are supporters of democracy , once again contradicting a popular image of saudi conservatism . 
on the saudis polled , 58 % considered democracy the best form of government , 23 % disagreed , and 18 % have not spoken . 
the massive support for democracy in a country without secular and nationalist history seems counter-intuitive . 
in fact , support for democracy corresponds to several other liberal attitudes that we found in saudi arabia . 
supporters of democracy tend to be less religious , more secular , more tolerant of others , more critical of the actions of the public sector , and more concerned with western cultural invasion . 
beyond the survey data , history has shown that liberal ideas become more prevalent when a despotic monarch governs with the support of a religious institution . 
a strong current of liberalism appeared at the end of the ninth century in ottoman syria in response to the religious despotism of sultan abdulhamid . 
at the same time , an anti-clerical , secular movement on behalf of constitutionalism appeared in iran , in reaction to the absolutist alliance between the quajar shahs and the religious establishment . 
in view of the similarities between these historical precedents and current conditions in saudi arabia , we should not rule out the possibility of reform . 
data from the study also suggest that the saudis could very well demand a more transparent politics and a less interventionist religion . 
the european museum 
by the end of the 19th century , asia accounted for europeans a source of inspiration art or the target of imperial ambitions . 
conversely , europe was a symbol of modernity - to meiji japan -- or decadence -- for the chinese . 
a century later , the japanese economic miracle , europeans saw at least a small part of asia as a centre of rapid technological and industrial progress . 
today , at the dawn of the 21st century , the perception of europe and asia are changing dramatically , with asia 's economies boom and a european union in full identity crisis . 
prominent asians , such as former prime minister lee kuan yew , are now warning europeans : if they continue on this path , their continent will soon be of interest to the tourism and high-end real estate . 
a prominent chinese businessman who divides his time between hong kong and london was even more precise . 
he said a few weeks ago , during a private gathering political leaders in paris and great entrepreneurs : " you 're becoming a third world country . you are wasting your time with the constitution , the welfare state , the pensions crisis , and you systematically give the wrong answers to the questions you raise . " 
the idea that europeans of asia in general , and china in particular , is more complex . it is lucid adjustment to a new competitor , respectable to pure ideological rejection . 
in may 1968 , some french students took to the streets to invent a new world dreamed of mao 's china , a country yet plunged in a brutal and senseless cultural revolution . 
this infatuation absurd was the result of both the ignorance of the crimes of the maoist regime , that boredom in a prosperous society near full employment . 
today , their heirs are openly criticizing the asian capitalist model . 
china , once star anti-capitalist utopian revolutionary , has become an ultra-liberal nemesis by a new generation of utopian reactionaries who defend the status quo in europe . 
students who marched in the streets of paris recently do not want to emulate the chinese and indians ; they reject the logic of globalisation and the abandonment of hard-won social guarantees . 
the attitude of the european economic elites is very different . 
they have understood that their slightly nostalgic post-colonial view of these , that china and india large export markets and huge reservoirs of cheap labor , are obsolete . 
these countries have become genuine competitors worthy of respect or admiration . 
the quality , the costs and delivery times - in the automobile industry , for example - are reaching the european level . 
europe retains an advantage in scientific disciplines , as in the pharmaceutical industry , but new businesses very efficient , particularly in india , are increasingly able to recruit graduates at mit and harvard , and -- thanks to wage costs still lower -- to remain competitive globally . 
unfortunately , if european leaders recognize the asian challenge , they have failed to translate that into a lesson of realism , in a context of globalisation irresistible , or in a call to arms in social and economic terms . 
in fact , the european politicians , with few exceptions , such as tony blair , have been slow to adapt to fulgurantes developments in asia . 
without long-term strategy and obsessed with short-term interests , european politicians - unlike the heads of companies - have not won the respect of their asian counterparts . 
is that , on a continent that has not managed to bury the past and close the specter of nationalism , the eu is also a model of reconciliation , peace and prosperity . 
but this image survive a continuation of the decline ? 
for asians , the european model could become a political version of venice : a place that you visit with nostalgia for a past glory as an admirable museum . 
red and blue 
the appointment of condoleezza rice to the post of secretary of state replacement of colin powell as us shows that the recent presidential election still have powerful effects . 
it is important that the americans but also particularly the rest of the world understand what these elections we reveal of america . 
the presidential election this year shows that america 's democracy is healthy , and that some things could be improved . 
unlike the election of 2000 , when president bush had not received the support of the popular vote and barely won the vote in the electoral college , bush prevailed to 3,5 million votes this time . 
while some democrats remain bitter , the legitimacy of the victory of mr bush cannot be challenged . 
america is closely divided between red states , republicans , and the blue states , democrats . 
if 100 000 votes had swung in the red state of ohio , john kerry would be president ( despite a minority of the popular vote ) . 
the electoral college was included in the american constitution to protect small states in the federal system and it now means that the election campaign focuses largely on a dozen states battlefield where public opinion is closely divided . 
basically , there is something unseemly in electing presidents without a popular majority . 
it is therefore time to discuss the amendment to the constitution to abolish the electoral college . 
some observers are complaining about the negative rhetoric and advertising good to sow discord that characterized the campaign . 
this must be seen in historical perspective . 
at the time of the founding fathers , newspapers were easily party and george washington was dismayed by the harshness of political language . 
for most of its early history , not to mention the civil war and the period of reconstruction , the country was also closely divided as it is today , and bitter campaign rhetoric has always reflected the competition . 
for all that , despite the negative advertisements by both sides , the three nationally televised debates raised important issues in a serious format and have been widely followed . 
in general , an incumbent president of economic growth is likely to be re-elected . 
in this sense , the real surprise of bush 's re-election was the low margin of its majority . 
in large part , this is because of the unpopularity of the war in iraq . 
kerry tried to turn the war , the low rate of job creation , the medical cover insufficient , and bush 's tax cuts for the rich of the central issues in the campaign , but some observers felt that it fails to send a clear message . 
mr bush has countered with the issue of security against terrorism and cultural populism on issues such as gay marriage and abortion . 
finally , the security and cultural populism prevailed against economic populism . 
the interpretation of the election has been influenced by exit polls in which voters were asked ( having voted ) on the issues that most counted for them . 
the majority ( 22 % ) answered " moral values , " by comparison only 20 % have cited the economy and 19 % terrorism . 
social conservatives interpreted this to mean that they won the election of mr bush and that their agenda should dominate his second term . 
however , a pew poll taken a week after the election indicated that the category " moral values " encompassed a wide range of issues besides abortion rights and gay marriage . 
in fact , polls show that 25 % of the public supports gay marriage and 35 % are in favour of legal civil unions for gay couples ( position that defended mr kerry ) . 
however , for the 37 % who oppose gay marriage , particularly in the red at the centre of the country , the issue has enabled us to rally supporters of mr bush to make them come to the polls . 
it remains to be seen , overall , if the us is hopelessly divided . 
the election map of red and blue states gave birth on internet jokes and cartoons on the two blue coasts seceding from the red center of the country . 
some call it " coastopia . " 
but the divisions are not so sharp . 
in the two camps , many states have been won by a narrow margin and if we dyed the cards by county rather than by state , much of the country looks in purple . 
cities against suburbs and rural areas would be a better description of the situation instead of coast against heart of the country . 
in fact , public opinion polls show that most americans are focused on moderate center of the political spectrum rather than at the two extremes . 
but political elites , such as political activists and members of congress , tend to be more extreme than the public . 
at first , this seems surprising , because they should feel attracted by the centre , rich voice . 
however , many members of congress represent districts that are granted to their party and the threat to their re-election comes in party primaries , dominated by the wings the more activist and the most extreme of the parties . 
this tendency is reinforced by the rise of cable television , which attracts viewers through contentious " infotainment " programs , and the internet blogs , who engage in fierce polemics with no editorial filter . 
a reform that would change the borders of congressional districts to make them more competitive permettrer to respond to this problem , but few elected will vote for changes that could increase their risk of defeat . 
the closeness of the results suggest that mr bush does not have a mandate for change that he believes have won . 
faced with difficult questions in terms of foreign policy , fiscal , and social , it would be wise to turn toward the center rather than reconcile his conservative base , but the policy which will prevail between the politics of conviction or pragmatic policy remains uncertain . 
use oil ! 
chancellor angela merkel has made the fight against climate change a high priority on german presidencies of the european union and the g8 , which starts in january . 
its concrete proposal is general enough for world leaders to consider and accept , and clear enough for other governments and businesses understand : at the next g8 summit , it simply set a date from which the petrol vehicles will not be registered in major industrialized countries . 
this decision will have a significant positive impact economic and geopolitical . 
today , the real concern in energy is not linked to the drop in world oil reserves , but rather the decline in domestic production of the biggest consumers -- europe , the united states and china -- , at the same time as the growing demand of asia strike on the market . 
the reserves available will focus more in the middle east , because those of other regions of the world will soon dry . 
what is more , the major oil exporters are not prepared to submit their investment policies to market conditions . 
saudi arabia wants to manage its oil production and , for its part , iran is fear potential investors with bureaucratic hurdles and corruption . 
iraq suffers from a lack of security , while the foreigners are thwarted at every attempt to investment in russia . 
those four states contain half of global oil reserves , two-thirds of which could potentially be exported . 
these factors , apart from the costs of production , are at the root of high oil prices and the race for the contracts in africa and central asia . 
the fact that the rise in oil prices is a good thing for the environment does not take account of the basic facts of international politics . 
first , in most poor countries of africa and asia , the import of oil represents a larger part of the national spending that in industrialized countries , which means that economic growth and social development are compromise , and that new debt crises loom . 
rents from oil production impede the reforms in the major exporting countries . 
thanks to strengthen their financial power , the regimes such as those in venezuela and iran feel less and less obliged by international rules . 
the latest arrivals one of the biggest energy consumer countries , such as china , mimic the old habits of the industrialized west and their long tradition to turn a blind eye to violations of human rights , in order to secure lucrative deals with the authoritarian regimes and rich in oil . 
only the political and economic heavyweights , industrialized countries which are by far the biggest consumers of hydrocarbons , can initiate change on a global scale . 
it is important to start by the transport sector , which currently accounts for more than half of oil consumption -- a proportion that is likely to rise in the future . 
therefore , the g8 countries will agree to no longer register of new cars rolling from 2025 . 
this decision is not directed against individual mobility , but against the waste of a scarce resource to serve as a priority to produce synthetic materials . 
politicians should not give priority to this or that technology . 
rather , they should encourage the car industry to develop alternative technologies that use the bio-mass fuel , ethylene , hydrogen , and even the natural gas , for a period of transition . 
the countries that have opened the way for the political will , as a collateral benefit , put the national industries in first place in energy technology to ensure future markets . 
the expected significant reduction of co2 emissions could ultimately lead to the necessary progress in international climate policies . 
the economic development between also at stake : if we take care of our " addiction " to oil , poor countries and less developed , and that the new industrialised countries , could be more , which would lower prices and easing geopolitical energy competition . 
geopolitically , the benefits would be equally obvious , as the big oil exporters would be less able to sing the industrialised countries . 
this could increase the bargaining power of the international community in the middle east , and strengthening the social forces countries such as saudi arabia , iran and russia , which seriously wish to promote economic and political reforms of the interior . 
great car producer and countries to technology breakthrough , germany is well placed to launch such an initiative . 
angela merkel , who holds a doctorate in physics and started his political career in the post of minister for the environment -- presiding in 1995 the first conference of the united nations framework convention on climate change -- would be more credible than any of his colleagues in the european union and the g8 to deal with the problem . 
it is high time to carry out an act of bravery policy . 
the myth of humanitarian aid and trade 
humanitarian aid and trade became international buzzwords . 
more humanitarian aid ( including debt relief ) and better access to markets in rich countries to poor countries " products now appears to be at the top of the international agenda . 
in fact , the debate today is not about the measures to take , but on the quantity of measures to be taken , and how fast . 
lost in all this : the clear lessons of the last five decades of economic development . 
at the forefront of those lessons , we find that economic development is largely in the hands of poor nations themselves . 
the countries that have done well in the recent past have succeeded thanks to their own efforts . 
humanitarian aid and the markets played only a minor role . 
take the example of a developing country that has free and preferential market access to its bigger neighbour , which also happens to be the strongest economy in the world . 
suppose that this country is able to send millions of its citizens to work the other side of the border , receives a huge volume of foreign investment and is fully integrated into the international production chains . 
in addition , the country 's banking system is supported by its rich neighbour and its stated desire to act as a lender of last resort . 
globalisation could not come much better than this , is it not ? 
now consider a second country . 
it faces a trade embargo on the world 's largest market , receives neither foreign aid nor any form of support from the western world , is excluded from international organizations such as the wto and cannot borrow from the imf and the world bank . 
if these external disadvantages were not debilitating enough , you can add an economy that interview itself barriers against international trade ( in the form of state trading , import tariffs and quantitative restrictions ) . 
as the reader may have guessed , these are real countries : mexico and vietnam . 
mexico shares a long border 3,200 miles with the united states , which provides not only the privileged access to a market of goods and labor , but also to a share of the resources of the us treasury ( as the experience of the 1995 peso crisis has made the demonstration ) . 
by contrast , america has maintained its trade embargo against vietnam until 1994 , has not restored diplomatic relations before 1995 and has not granted the status most-favoured-nation to vietnamese imports that many years later . 
vietnam is still not entered the wto . 
now consider their economic performance . 
since the signing of nafta in december 1992 , the mexican economy has grown at an average annual rate of just over 1 % per head . 
this is not only far below the rates of champions of the asian economy , but it is also only a fraction of the performance of mexico 's own growth decades leading up to the debt crisis of 1982 ( 3,6 % per year between 1960 and 1981 ) . 
vietnam , however , grew at an annual rate of 5,6 % per capita since the onset of its economic reforms in 1988 and the restoration of diplomatic relations with the united states in 1995 and has continued to grow at a rapid pace of 4,5 % since . 
vietnam has witnessed a dramatic fall in poverty , while mexico has been a fall in real wages . 
these two countries experienced sharp international trade and foreign investment , but the picture is very different where it counts the most : in improving living standards , especially among the poor . 
what these examples show is that domestic efforts trump all other elements in the determination of the economic fortunes of a country . 
everything that the american market had to offer in mexico could not offset the consequences of policy mistakes on the internal market , especially the failure to reverse the real appreciation of the peso 's exchange rate or extend the productivity gains achieved in a narrow range of activities for export to the rest of the economy . 
what matters most is the adoption by a country the right growth strategy . 
without any advantage in mexico , vietnam has pursued a strategy focused on diversifying its economy and improving production capacity from local suppliers . 
the overall experience post-war that the domestic policies are what matter most . 
south korea took off in the early 1960s , not when foreign aid was at its apex , but when they began to seize up . 
taiwan has not benefited from foreign aid or privileged access to certain markets . 
china and india , the economic superstars of the moment , have prospered largely through their own reform efforts . 
it is tempting to foreign demand for their products for export the rare african successes , botswana and mauritius ( diamonds and garments , respectively ) , but it cannot go very far . 
of course , these two countries would be much poorer without access to foreign markets . 
but , as in all the cases of successful development , what distinguishes them is not the external advantages they possess , but their ability to exploit these advantages . 
it is enough to see how other countries have squandered the advantage that their purchase their natural wealth . 
the word " diamond " hardly conjures images of peace and prosperity in sierra leone . 
similarly , few of the export processing zones proliferating around the world have experienced the level of development that we observed in mauritius . 
it absolves rich countries of their obligation to help . 
they can make life harder for corrupt dictators , sharing more financial information and by refusing to recognise the international contracts that they sign . 
similarly , the increase in the number of workers from poor countries allowed to work in rich countries , and a wider range of growth-oriented policies by relaxation of the rules and wto conditions imposed by the united states would produce a greater impact on the long-term development . 
it is not proven that the expansion of access to markets and subsidies represents the best use of political capital of the northern hemisphere . 
the development should focus on improving the political environment in poor countries , rather than on aid and trade . 
interdependencies 
if the great argentine economist raul prebisch were alive today , he no doubt would wonder if the world is set to turn to the head . 
his theory hugely influential dependence argued that if poor countries relied too much on exports of raw materials , they would never achieve the industrial level needed to sustain rapid growth . 
they are ever-dwindling in a cycle of decline global commodity prices and reduced income . 
the answer prebisch favorite , protectionism , proved disastrous for the many latin american and african countries that have followed . 
but the fact is that for years , prebisch seems to have had the right commodity price trends over the long term . 
the efficiency gains in the areas of agriculture and the extraction of natural resources have lowers the prices of raw materials , especially in the 1980s and 1990s . 
with a few exceptions , countries that focused on commodity exports performed dismally , while the asian countries with only few resources have made rapid progress . 
today , however , with the asian giants , india and china , joining the global economy , the price of petrol , gold , wheat , and virtually every other raw materials are exploding . 
of course , there will always be cycles ( the price of oil , for example , will probably fall before they start rising again ) but the long-term trend of many commodities will clearly remain upward for some time yet . 
what many trade negotiators and other policymakers do not seem to have acknowledge yet , though prebisch would have understood immediately , it is that this dramatic turn of events has huge implications for the global balance of power . 
indeed , any other aspect of economic globalization will pose major challenges to the leaders of the world over the decades to come . 
the questions are many . 
today 's rich countries prepared to enter a period of co-dependency , in which they are just as desperate for raw materials that developing countries are industrial products and technology ? 
are they prepared for the inevitable flow of power and influence to the countries producers of raw materials as they become much wealthier ? 
how will the world 's two superpowers , china and the united states , come to terms with the fact that important exporting areas of raw materials in africa and the middle east to central asia are covered with poorly trained nation states ? 
some self-appointed prophets expose the problem as that of the limits of natural reserves and claim that the raw materials the more critical are shrinking at an alarming rate . 
nowadays , many are followers of the theory of " hubbert 's peak " of oil production , which supports that we have reached the upper limits of our production capacities , the wells are running dry , and the situation can only deteriorate . 
however , as the leading oil historian dan yergin points out , prophets of doom have declared that the resources in black gold were on the verge of at least four times already . 
each time , radical improvements in technology made the threat evaporate . 
in the late 1800s , oil extraction involved dredging with a mule . 
today , drill to 3 , 000 feet beneath the ocean floor to everyone . 
such progress has also been made in the areas of metals mining and agriculture . 
no , the world is not facing a shortage of raw materials . 
in reality , it is happening is that the integration of 2,5 billion people ( china and india ) in the global economy is producing a demand shift that could put more pressure on rising commodity prices that no technology gains are likely to offset . 
therefore , and at least 50 to 75 years , and perhaps until humans start to drill on march over the centuries to come , the price of many natural resources will rise . 
the new balance of economic power that results from it will destabilise the political situation in the world ? 
the first world war was partly triggered by germany 's concern by grabbing the other colonial powers of too large a share of world oil and raw materials . 
similarly , during the second world war , japan has fears for the stability of its supplies of oil and other natural resources abroad . 
will similar tensions arise between china to resources uncertain ( even water scarcity is a problem ) and the west ? 
fortunately , this does not seem likely for the moment , especially given the sober pragmatic approach that problems of resources of their country displayed by the chinese leaders . 
the chinese are looking to regions like africa in the hope of finding stable trading partners . 
they do not share the political evangelism of the americans , who do not just want to trade with commodity exporters , but also want to convert them . 
and then there are those american leaders who still talk about making the us self-sufficient in terms of energy resources . 
it is a joke : enough , perhaps , but self-sufficient , never . 
a large part of the arab world think , and it is understandable that the invasion of iraq is the cornerstone of the us strategy to get hold of energy resources stable . 
if they are right , we can only hope that america has a fallback . 
in the meantime , commodity prices will continue to increase , and the oil exporters constitute the largest contributors to yawning trade deficit of the united states . 
perhaps the real us strategy is to try to have the oil exporters so much money that they will become dependent on the happiness they provide to america ! 
this is a turning point that prebisch would never have expected . 
the choice iran 's radical 
the choice of iranians to take to power the hardline mayor of tehran , mahmoud ahmadinejad , is likely to worsen relations with the west and the country 's international isolation . 
yet , in terms of national policy , the islamist regime is likely to be better than if a more moderate had prevailed . 
it is clear that ahmadinejad has a real base of support . 
the fact that he ran as a populist , he spoke of helping the poor , condemned the government and acted almost like an opposition candidate does not count : he was the choice of the regime , and ended up receive an official aid including against rivals radicals . 
the regime has shown great skill . 
he has transformed the candidate a little more pragmatic hashemi rafsanjani , in disagreement with some government policies , in character in harmony with the established order , and its own candidate in a rebel . 
the government has used the resentment against the establishment to consolidate his own power . 
given that the former president , mohammad khatami , supported the reformist movement , even if it was little foolhardy and that he has done nothing in the end , this only highlight how leaders have returned to their advantage the political situation . 
ahmadinejad is a representative of the younger activists of the anti-shah revolution it was 25 years ago . 
it is directly involved in the taking of american hostages in iran , though we do not really know how . 
the more worrying is that it is close to the two main groups that represent the most extreme elements of iran : the islamic revolutionary guard corps and the basij organization . 
the first is a parallel army pro-r√©gime ; the second is an organisation that intimidating opponents and anyone in search of a more open society . 
however , concern that iran in the hands of even more radical leadership is mitigated by two factors . 
first , ahmadinejad will undoubtedly focus on domestic problems , and try - without that we can predict its chances of success - to improve the living conditions of poorest iranians . 
secondly , the group in power since the revolution will continue to lead the ideological and foreign policies . 
the president has fewer powers than it seems , and it is particularly overshadowed by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei . 
in any event , the election of ahmadinejad cr√©ment clarifies the challenge that iran poses for western policy and the stability of the middle east . 
first , it sends a signal to the most extreme elements in iran and that country 's terrorist clients -- the lebanese hezbollah , the palestinian hamas and islamic jihad , and several small groups that act against saudi arabia , iraq and other arab countries -- they have the green light to launch their attacks . 
they are likely to assume that iran will support them whatever they do . 
outwardly , iran has often been relatively cautious , while playing to covered the world 's leading sponsor of terror . 
iranian officials have , individually , act to order and coordinate specific operations , will now feel freer to do so . 
in addition , ahmadinejad openly advocates an intensive programme of obtaining nuclear weapons . 
most iranian politicians , at least those allowed by the government to act on the big day , supports this programme , but encourage an approach more discr√™te and cautious . 
rafsanjani , for example , put the establishment of better relations with the west before the forward on the nuclear front . 
if ahmadinejad is president of a nuclear iran , it is more likely to use the weapons to an adventurous manner . 
this does not mean that he would fire them , but rather that he would use them for the purposes of diplomatic blackmail , raising the threats to levels of crisis . 
since that iranian leaders daily proclaim their desire to wipe israel off the map and to fight the united states ( ahmadinejad stepped on the image of an american flag going to vote ) , the risk of confrontation has increased . 
finally , ahmadinejad is likely to be bolder in subverting the stability of iraq , and his victory will encourage radical iranian officials and iraqi extremists . 
iran already sends many agents in iraq and supports clients who seek to transform this country into a clone . 
the iraqis , including shia muslims , who are following the same version of islam that iranians , generally reject such interference . 
a more militant iranian position can increase friction with iraq , and inspire more anti-american violence . 
in short , the outcome of the iranian elections is dangerous , even if its destabilizing will depend on the acts of ahmadinejad and the degree of power him by khamenei . 
moreover , dealing with an iran also openly extreme radical - even by the standards of a regime already hard -- will be a challenge not only for the united states , but also for europe . 
the european countries going to continue to pretend that the militant rhetoric and the provocation of ahmadinejad does not count and that it is possible to find a diplomatic solution to iran 's nuclear ambitions ? 
with rafsanjani , a true agreement or the pretense of cooperation would have been easy to maintain . 
but , with ahmadinejad , it will be a huge dose of conciliation to maintain even the most minimal diplomatic process . 
some iranian reformers and exiles welcome the election of ahmadinejad , because they believe that his administration is more likely to show the true face of the regime and disabuse any western hopes of compromise . 
but it may also represent the success of the regime to return to its advantage the discontent caused by a quarter of a century of radical islamist r√™gne . 
whatever the consequences , ahmadinejad 's victory mean for the west that everything in iran will become even more difficult . 
take the poor , give to the rich 
president bush seems on the verge of ruining the us budget for the coming years . 
when president bush took office , the outlook was for budget surpluses as long as you could imagine . 
today , thanks to a mixture of tax cuts irresponsible launched by the republicans , an economic slowdown , the bursting of the stock market bubble , and a massive increase in military spending , the fiscal horizon is dominated by large deficits . 
the worst is still to come , because the bush administration and congress to republican majority are preparing to deepen the fiscal mess . 
the damage they will do will likely weaken the us and add the instability of the global economy . 
usually , the us republican party stood for balanced budgets . 
this changed with the reagan administration , when conservative republicans favored tax cuts , even when it came through large budget deficits . 
president reagan told the american people that they could enjoy both of tax cuts , the strengthening of the army and the continuation of their favorite spending programs . 
the result , not surprisingly , was a series of large budget deficits and whose disposal took several years . 
president george bush sr. that president bill clinton had to raise taxes to bring order to the chaos of the reagan era . 
these tax increases probably contributed to the defeat of president bush 's father by bill clinton in 1992 . 
yet clinton bravely decided to complete the process to restore fiscal balance , in part to protect the long-term financing of the social security retirement program . 
when clinton left office in 2000 , the budget situation was the best for decades . 
then came the president george bush son , ready to replay reagan large tax cuts , a big increase in military spending , and the continuation and even the development of popular spending programs . 
the result was predictable . 
in january 2001 , the cumulative budget projections for the years 2002 to 2011 anticipated a budget surplus of 5,6 trillions of dollars . 
by mid-2002 , these projected surpluses had vanished . 
in the light of these new economic conditions , and in the shadow of the war against iraq , you might expect the bush administration and the republican congress to be cautious in defence of new tax cuts . 
but no , their main priority is to put in place more tax cuts that benefit the rich in large part . 
at the same time , the government is calling for big increases in military spending . 
with the approach of the presidential election of november 2004 , you can be certain that no significant reduction in spending will not intervene in the programmes not military . 
so it seems that the massive budget deficits are here to stay . 
if domestic spending simply stays constant , at a fraction of national income , the cumulative budget outcome of the next ten years will be a combined deficit of 1,5 trillions of dollars . 
but this figure could be optimistic , because it probably does not adequately account the cost of a likely war against iraq , nor another round of tax cuts or the risk of higher interest rates in the coming years . 
why the republicans so unconcerned about this mess ? 
some republicans care more about tax cuts for the wealthy than any other thing . 
others believe that deficits will force major cuts in domestic government spending , thus reducing the participation of the state , which is their heart 's desire . 
the problem of this latest analysis is that most taxpayers are attached to the social programmes , and will not readily support big spending cuts . 
the more intriguing question is why americans vote for such policies , when they should know that it would result in probably problems . 
a possible answers is the fact that many voters do not see the budgetary problems . 
a better answer is that most americans did not actually voted for these policies . 
the turnout of the 2002 election was that 40 % of the electorate , and only about half of the 40 % went to the republicans , or around 20 percent of people in right to vote . 
of course , the outlook need not be so gloomy . 
the iraq war may be avoided . 
proposed tax cuts may be watered down or abandoned . 
but i predict large budget deficits for years to come , and a growing sense of unease within the united states and abroad about america 's macroeconomic situation . 
foreign investors may decide to reduce their funding from the state budget and current-account deficit of america in favorable terms . 
the dollar could weaken , and fears of inflation could become more pronounced . 
all this will lose confidence to policymakers of the united states , which will then be less flexible in their responses to the economic shocks . 
the poor , the united states and abroad , could suffer the most , as president bush and the congress tell the american people and the world that there is no money available to address the issue of poverty , health and education , because of the large budget deficits . 
if the average american does not open the eyes on these fiscal risks , the wealthy could benefit from another gift of several billion dollars while the country and the world bear the harsh consequences for years to come . 
lessons to be learned from the fiscal recklessness of america 
george w. bush has done more to destroy us economic policy that all the other presidents in american history , exceeding even his mentor , ronald reagan . 
in just three years in office , it has destroyed a fragile political consensus that had asked ten years of efforts and that could take another decade to be reconstructed . 
in doing so , bush has risked economic health and social stability in the long term of america . 
given that the long-term budgetary challenges that the us an extremely clumsy are not the only existing challenges , america 's fiscal blunders provide important lessons for other countries . 
the main problem with fiscal policy is that politicians can easily make themselves temporarily popular by cutting taxes and increasing public spending while running up massive public debts and leaving repayment to the future . 
this ploy can last a few years , but the budget deficits and growing public debt required earlier than scheduled a painful change of policy . 
yet a cynical politician can buy his re-election and perhaps be in retirement when the crisis coming . 
one would imagine that after decades of such episodes of fiscal irresponsibility in the countries of the world , voters would be allergic to this type of ruse . 
however , bush is doing it again , buying popularity today by doling out massive tax cuts while simultaneously increasing military spending , and spending on education and health . 
the result is a budget deficit equivalent to more than 5 % of gdp . 
worse still , the long-term budgetary outlook of america were already worrying before bush begins his reckless policies . 
the us population is aging , so that the costs of pension systems and health care financed by public funds will increase sharply . 
careful calculations show that the income that will be made available through the tax policies favored by bush may not achieve the tens of trillions of dollars that represent the costs of public pensions , health care and other fiscal spending expected by the population . 
at some point in the future , it will greatly increase recoveries taxes , drastically reducing public spending , or both , to compensate for the actions of bush . 
so why the population support his policies ? 
because it understands little these consequences on the long term , or that she cares little , even though they will eventually impact on the majority of americans . 
the richest taxpayers are , of course , happy because they received the bulk of the tax cuts . 
amazingly , the richest 5 % of us taxpayers received about half of the tax cuts , and these rich taxpayers clearly expect the other 95 % ( the middle class and the poor ) bear the majority of future spending cuts and tax increases . 
meanwhile , bush has convinced many poor and middle-class voters that they should be happy , too , without telling them that they will have to pay their small tax cuts with much larger cuts in future government services if his administration 's policies prevail in the long term . 
if the americans had a political memory , they would understand that they have already climbed this fiscal " roller coaster " over the last 20 years . 
ronald reagan also took office promising massive tax cuts and large increases in military spending . 
that ended a huge budget deficit by the mid-1980s . 
tax cuts made reagan extremely popular and have allowed him to be re-elected in 1984 . 
it then took over a decade ( starting in reagan 's second term until the terms of george bush , sr. and bill clinton ) to return to a budget surplus . 
of course , this result has need the approval of new tax increases , which has cost george bush , sr. his re-election and led to the polarized politics of the 1990s . 
the story is likely to be repeated . 
some right-wing ideologues in the bush administration believe that the budget deficits will ultimately a drastic reduction in social spending of the government . 
they hope to dismantle programs such as social security and medicare . 
but the american people strongly supports these social programs . 
the strategy which is first to cut taxes in order to lead subsequently mandatory cuts in social programs is doomed to failure and must inevitably lead to higher tax rates . 
others in the bush administration argue that tax cuts play a crucial role to pull the us out of recession . 
this argument is also wrong . 
america 's economy could recover without the tax cuts , and perhaps even more robustly . 
in all cases , it is a huge mistake to build long-term tax policies on the economic cycle in the short term . 
the other countries have two vital lessons to be learned from this situation . 
the first is that the looming us budget deficits will sooner or later limit america 's international power . 
the americans have supported the iraq war only because they did not have to pay for it higher taxes . 
when americans are forced to choose between foreign adventures and higher taxes , they will be much less likely to support expensive military operations abroad . 
indeed , the us will be deeply divided internally when the population will be grappling with the fiscal mess left by bush . 
the second lesson is that countries need to plan their budgets depending on the rising fiscal costs by an ageing population . 
long-term budgetary conditions are rarely taken into account by taxpayers or parliament . 
governments should be required to submit long-term budget assessments at the same time their annual budget proposals , in order to reduce the tendency towards short-run political manipulation of the budget . 
the us can play the role of a wake-up call for other countries . 
the white house should give to other countries the same council that the wizards to television give their viewers : " do not try this at home . " 
the politicisation of the securities markets 
many economic and financial analysts complain that the securities markets of the emerging countries are often heavily manipulated by their governments and are more political than economic . 
by contrast , a pristine force of economic nature governs the securities markets in advanced countries and predict their performance is in fact predict the growth of trees . 
this description of stock markets in emerging countries is not wrong , just biased , because the same description applies to stock markets in advanced countries . 
indeed , the best analysts know that predict the performance of the securities market of any country is basically to predict the degree to which the government hopes that stock market investors involved in the current political environment . 
take the stock market of the united states , by far the most important in the world . 
the government leaves companies alone and that the returns on investment in the us stock market reflect the fundamental forces of a capitalist economy strong . 
this partly explains why the us attract portfolio investors around the world . 
but the returns that make us stock markets so attractive reflect a delicate political balance . 
in particular , tax rates that affect securities have varied over time with the change of political pressure . 
during the second world war , for example , political support for great fortunes diminished and the government has sharply increased taxes on capital gains , dividends , and high incomes in general . 
when the second world war has led a strong recovery from the great depression of the 1930s , president roosevelt and congress have introduced a tax on windfall profits in order to ensure that shareholders would not benefit too much . 
by contrast , in 1980 , when there was no war but the stock market was at a low level , american voters have elected ronald reagan , a man considered by many as too far to the right to be president . 
it has asked for , and received , tax cuts on capital gains , dividends , and income . 
political interference in the stock market is not only on taxes on capital gains , dividends , and income . 
property taxes , indirect taxes , import duties and taxes on sales , all of which are paid , directly or indirectly , by businesses , can have a magnified impact on corporate profits , and therefore on the stock market . 
it is no coincidence that wherever stock markets thrive , governments to ensure that these taxes downgrade to the maximum corporate profits after tax . 
indeed , the policies of the securities markets do not stop to taxes . 
on the contrary , almost every activity of government affects corporate profits and , subsequently , the stock market . 
after the stock market crash of 1929 , the us government has suspended a large part of the antitrust activity allowing companies to acquire a monopoly that would increase their value . 
this policy has delayed the lowering of the high unemployment rate , but has not been enough to rein in the political forces deployed to support the stock market . 
similarly , one of the most important businesses by president reagan did was to destroy a large part of the remaining power of trade unions of america , which compete for their share of the industrial cake . 
the victory won by reagan during the strike of air traffic controllers in 1981 was a watershed event for the us labor movement , and also for the stock market , which has launched its spectacular market in 1982 . 
the us government has been particularly aggressive in supporting the stock market since the culmination of the illusion of share prices in 2000 , and reducing the interest rates repeatedly . 
of course , this was publicly justified in terms of stimulating the economy , not in terms of support for the stock market . 
but it is a telling sign of the scale of the us stock market that one of the most important factors weighing on the economy was declining equity prices . 
indeed , the response of the authorities is not limited to monetary stimulus . 
the national accounts of products and income of united states show that the effective rate of tax on profits of companies ( the percentage of benefits being paid out to the government in the form of taxes ) is mounted in crete at 33,7 % during the first quarter of 2000 ( the record of the securities market and the economy in general ) , and has fallen to 20,2 % during the fourth quarter of 2003 , when the market was low . 
much of this decline reflects explicit tax relief measures passed by congress as well as the perception among businesses , that in the current economic and political environment , they can be more aggressive in order to avoid paying taxes . 
moreover , after the stock market crash , the maximum tax on dividends paid on securities has fallen from 35 % to 15 % , giving a substantial new advantage long-term investors and intensifying the combined effect of the reinvestment of dividends after tax . 
again , this tax cut was justified to stimulate the economy , which can , of course , be applied to almost any measure aimed at supporting the stock market . 
but it is the balance of the political forces that determines the credibility of this type of justification . 
one might argue that the same variables , including hostility to high taxes and a weak labor movement , have operated in the united states over the past 200 years , and that they should continue to operate in the future , producing high returns on the securities markets and attracting huge inflows of foreign investment . 
those who believe that investments in the us stock market will follow the same trend of higher growth for decades may well be right . 
but it is important to be clear on what we predicted . 
the forecasts are , above all , not only on the economy , but also on the policy , and even the cultural values , which shape economic policies and performance . 
the housing market to global scale 
there is no investment most local real-estate investment . the residence that you buy is rooted in a particular place like a tree , and flowers or withering in response to local economic conditions . 
the whole world flashes by on our television screens , but the housing market , composed almost entirely of local amateurs , rarely crosses the geographical borders local . 
soon , however , this could change . 
within a month , the chicago mercantile exchange ( cme ) , in collaboration with my company , macromarkets , as well as fiserv and standard & poor' 's , will launch of options on futures in home prices in ten cities in the united states . 
the contracts will be based on the evidence of the s & p / case-shiller home price established , according to the research that my colleague karl case and i have almost twenty years . 
for many years we have been campaigning for a property market futures , but no exchange , until now , wanted to use these indices to create such a market . 
the markets on home prices will allow investors around the world to invest in us homes indirectly , through these markets . 
a buyer in paris , rio de janeiro and tokyo will have the opportunity to invest in owner-occupied homes in new york , los angeles , and las vegas . 
one of the fundamental principles of financial theory -- diversification or the distribution of the risks -- means that interest in the new contracts will be strong . 
the companies and the people of new york , for example , are overexposed to local real estate risks . however , selling their homes to term , they should reduce these risks . 
investors in tokyo will assume some of the risks by buying in term of housing in new york , if the price is right . 
new yorkers will continue to live in their homes , while have spread the investment risk around the world . 
the experience of a genuine futures market on single-family homes has not been attempted since 1991 , when the london and options exchange ( now called euronext.liffe ) has missed the launch of such a market . 
this trial has never generated large volumes of transactions . 
the stock market has launched a concept that has convinced person . 
the uk markets of paris diversified on home prices , as some retail markets online , have never amounted to much either . 
will it be different this time ? 
of course , the launch of a new market is still uncertain . people are interested in an idea if she seduced already many others ; if no one is there , it does not attract more . 
the same goes for the markets . if there are no interested investors , it will not happen quite of transactions to generate profits needed to attract others . 
however , as is the case for all brilliant ideas , we never know very well why they attractive . also , we can be the start of this new market , but we know that , sometimes , the success is at the meeting . 
initial indications suggest the growing interest in futures trading of home prices , particularly because of the speech about the " housing bubble " underscores the importance of risk diversification . 
after the cme 's announcement , one of its competitors , the chicago board options exchange , said its project to create options contracts on major us regions , based on the median home price published by the national association of realtors ( national association of estate agents ) . 
however , in addition to the strong public interest in investing in housing and the coverage of risks , another thorny issue must be resolved if the futures markets work well : prices must be revealed , and investors must understand the meaning . 
i believe that there is a great chance that these markets to end soon lead to a drop in prices in some american cities . 
it will be a question of " backwardation " say traders . today , the price on the market is lower than the price of a property . 
maybe backwardation will not appear on the first day of the property transactions , but it should happen at the end of a few months . 
we might need backwardation if some of these markets to fulfill their functions . 
everyone knows that these cities have experienced a huge real estate boom in recent years ( this is a global phenomenon ) . 
international investors do not seem inclined to invest in these cities , without the prospect of falling prices , based on the futures markets . the inhabitants of tokyo have learnt to their cost . 
however , if backwardation is strong enough , even investors who believe that the us housing market is declining will still be able to expect a good return of home price futures , because they already receive a lower prices on the futures market . 
however , new yorkers will need to make some adjustments to cover their own real estate investments , if they want to sell futures contracts a built-in price decline . 
they will have to get used to the idea that the market has already anticipated this decline , and that they can protect themselves from potential margin that exceed this expectation . 
in fact , such adjustments in our thinking will likely occur if you look carefully at futures market prices . 
until now , the evolution of real estate prices has mainly been the result of diverse opinions . 
when the markets create an international consensus on the price of homes in all the major cities of the world , it will be easier to manage the risks they face in , thereby stabilizing their economies and on the other hand , our own lives . 
but what moves the markets ? 
since the 10 may , most of the world markets have accused strong cumulative declines , especially in the two weeks around the 23 may , average of course who persist in the fall . 
the concerns about the global equity markets are synonymous with concerns for the economy in the world ? 
consider the reductions the more marked . 
among the major countries , the crash the most impressive is that of india , where prices have fallen 16,9 % between may 10 and 22 may . 
the debacle of the other side of the globe took almost as scale . there , the ups and downs have had a few days later with those of india : argentina , prices have fallen 16,1 % , in brazil 14,7 % and mexico to 13,8 % . 
european markets have also suffered large losses . 
in sweden , prices have plummeted from 15,2 % between may 9 and 22 may ; almost at the same time , they have fallen 9,7 % in germany , 9,4 % in france and the united kingdom and 9,3 % in italy . 
in asia , prices have fallen by 11,5 % in korea , 9,3 % in hong kong and 8 % in japan roughly on the same period . 
many commentators are trying to combine these events to the situation in the united states . 
however , the way americans have accused that lower 5,2 % between 9 and on 24 may . 
china does not seem to be behind this global decline since prices have increased there during this period . 
the standard explanations of economists concern the monetary policies . 
in the wake of the great fear of deflation of 2003 , central banks worldwide have reduced interest rates , causing explosions on the speculative property markets and the stock market . 
but today , according to this view , interest rates increasing are starting to take effect , which suggests new declines on the markets . 
without doubt , there is an important element of truth in that argument . 
the us federal reserve has indeed increased interest rates on 10 and its chairman , ben bernanke , has indicated that further increases could be held in the future . 
the 17 may , a worsening american data has been pointed out , this suggests future durcissements monetary . 
economists like to think that the world is logical and manageable , which means that they understand what is happening there . 
but in doing so , they often overstate the role of central banks . 
indeed , the increase in american rates was only fit in a series of rate increases -- the 16th in a row . 
no other major central bank has increased its rates after the beginning of the decline in stock markets in may until 25 june , when several have put ( the european central bank , india , south korea , south africa , thailand and turkey ) . 
another factor : the price of oil , which has risen by 24 % between march 22 and 2 may , beating all its records . 
that would certainly be a major event able to influence markets around the world . 
the increases in oil prices played the role of the villain in virtually all economic downturns since the second world war . 
and yet , the lyrical oil prices do not correspond to the time when asset prices have fallen the most , in mid-may . 
argue that these increases have caused the declines of markets requires a gap of several weeks . 
but the stock markets are not very logical , and mistimed a response to the shock of the oil price could be possible . 
as for all the way in any financial market , an increase always attracts the attention . 
when oil prices are rising rapidly , people look at the information that talk about it and discuss them of these increases , creating by themselves an increased sensitivity to these new . 
the crisis in the middle east is linked to the price of oil , and it has been the dominant information in may . 
signs of doom and the strong language used by various political personalities have been amplified in the minds of investors by oil price rises . 
on 8 may , israel 's deputy prime minister shimon peres , in response to the hostile statements by the iranian president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has dealt that " the iranian president should remember that iran also could be wiped off the map . " 
similarly , the area around the beginning of the fall in the stock market in may , ahmadinejad has visited indonesia , the country with the largest number of muslims in the world , and newspapers have reported on 13 may that he had received a real ovation from students of two of the best universities in the country . 
this story may have been interpreted as proof that the strategy of the tightrope to ahmadinejad in the nuclear field gives political dividends , fueling the perception that the tense situation in the middle east could lead to further increases in the price of oil . 
these articles in newspapers can seem much more remote from the stock markets that monetary policy . 
but the public reaction that they are , as well as the recent increases in oil prices , could go for a good measure in the change of market psychology . 
attitudes will change with the time , and events such as the remarks d ahmedinejad and peres can rush these changes . 
so , although these events are difficult to quantify , perhaps analysts should they also pay attention to the words of ahmadinejad to those of bernanke when they try to understand the direction of the global equity markets . 
economists may not like focus on the mentality of the public and how it interacts with price fluctuations , the new world and the dynamic . 
this would mean that the economic events are less predictable ( and economists less omniscients ) that they do not like to imagine . 
however , a point of view intuitive it would be logical to do so . 
that there really is in the minds of investors ? 
ahmadinejad is a charismatic figure , not bernanke . 
ahmadinejad is embarking on an adventure , not bernanke . 
and , perhaps most important , ahmadinejad has a destabilizing influence , not bernanke . 
whatever their cause , in the end , the world 's stock drops in mid-may indicate a market psychology unstable . 
hard to believe that they were linked to of opinions on possible monetary policies , and not to questions broader and deeper , particularly regarding energy and the political tension , which are the foundations of the performance of the global economy . 
why pay more for the fair trade ? 
marks & spencer , the supermarket and clothing chain owner of 400 stores across britain , has just announced that it is converting its entire range of coffee and tea , including 38 different products in the " fair trade " label , the marketing symbol of the " ethical production . " 
the chain already sells only tea and coffee this label in these 200 caf√© revive coffee shops . 
it also encourages the purchase of shirts and other goods made from cotton from fair trade . 
the announcement came during the fortnight " fair trade " . over these two weeks of promotion of approved products , have been held with producers in developing countries in order to explain the british how this form of commerce has helped their communities . 
the movement toward more ethical consumption is also a significant step forward in the united states . consumers increasingly turn to organic , locally produced foods , such as the eggs of hens in freedom . 
in the uk , a study has shown that more than 50 % of respondents recognized the symbol of fair trade and understood that products bearing the label complied with more working conditions of producers in the developing world . 
there are currently no study comparable to the united states , but the data reported and the discussions i had with my own students , suggests that the figure would be less high for the americans . 
traders seeking fair trade certification must pay producers a price that covers the costs of sustainable production and a living wage . 
for example , the minimum price for a pound of coffee is $ 1,26 , regardless of the reduction in the level of the market . 
if the market price goes beyond that figure , the fair trade price will increase in order to remain five cents per pound higher . 
as for small producers , they must be organized in cooperatives or other groups for democratic participation . 
plantations and factories can claim the label fair trade if they offer a decent wage to their workers , if they comply with the standards , health , safety , and environmental if they allow unions or any other form of associations of workers , if they provide accommodation worthy to workers who are working away from home and if they do not use or forced labor , child labor or . 
however , everyone does not approve of fair trade . 
brink lindsey , director of the center for trade policy studies pro-market cato institute , believes that the campaign for fairtrade coffee is a " dead end paved with good intentions . " 
with some justification , he argues that the real cause of the fall in the price of coffee is not the profiteering of multinationals , but in the enormous increase of coffee production in brazil and vietnam , combined with new techniques to grow by working less and therefore at no cost . 
in the prospect of lindsey , if we want to help the coffee growers , we need to encourage them to abandon the coffee and turn to more profitable crops -- it insists here , rightly , to trade restrictions imposed by rich countries and on subsidies which are obstacles to be deleted -- or towards products of high value added , such as special cafes that can be paid more expensive . 
which is strange in lindsey 's argument , however , is that the campaign for fair coffee seems to do exactly what he recommends , that is to say encourage coffee farmers to produce special cafes that can be paid more expensive . 
pro-market economists do not object to businesses which use openly the attractiveness of the luxury to promote their products . 
if people are prepared to spend $ 48 for a pound of jamaican blue mountain coffee because it is the james bond , economists do not , in this case , that the market is being distorted . 
so why be critical when consumers who want to pay $ 12 for a pound of coffee that they know has been grown without pesticides , under shade trees to the survival of birds , by producers who can now afford to feed and educate their children ? 
economists might reply to that if you want to help people feed and educate their children , it is possible to buy a book of non-fairtrade coffee that tastes the same $ 10 and pay the remaining $ 2 to a charity , which distributes food and education poor children . 
it is actually a possible strategy . however , fair trade present real benefits . 
producers know that they must make a coffee appreciated consumers not only for its taste , but also for the way it is grown . 
if their coffee sells well , they are proud to have produced a product sought in the world . 
from the point of view of the growers , receive a premium selling a fairtrade product is preferable to obtaining a charity that they would get that they work or not , and regardless of the quality of their production . 
pay more for a fairtrade product is not more " anti-market " that spending more to buy a product of gucci brand . 
in addition , this label reflects better priorities ethical . 
it is not only a subsidy by governments , its success depends on market demand and not political lobbying . 
fortunately , in europe , this demand is growing rapidly . 
let us hope that it will soon reach similar levels throughout the developed countries , where consumers can decide to their discretionary spend their money . 
calves , pigs and american democracy 
amidst all the headlines about the return of the democratic majority in congress after the november election , the result of an important election has gone largely unnoticed . 
although it has highlighted the shortcomings of the american political system , he has also made it possible to believe in the compassion of ordinary americans . 
in arizona , citizens can , if they have gathered enough signatures , submit a draft law to a direct popular vote . 
this year , one of the issues on the ballot was a law to prohibit pregnant sows , or calves reared for meat , tethering or confining in a way that prevents them from turning around freely , lie down or extend their members . 
those who do not know the factory farming may wonder why the need for such legislation . 
traditional farming , such that it applied everywhere in the world fifty years ago , and in some countries still today , allows animals to move and stretch . 
but now , almost 90 percent of the sows -- the mothers of the pigs reared and slaughtered for meat , bacon and ham -- spend most of their lives in stalls that measure about 60 centimeters by 2 , 2 metres . 
they can neither turn , their legs fully extended , or move forward or back more than a step . 
they are also kept on short tethers . 
in the same way , the calves are confined their lives in individual stalls where they cannot turn around , to sleep or stretch . 
for the most part , these methods are designed to save the cost of labor . they facilitate the management of animals and allow us to use less and less skilled workers . 
they also prevent the animals from wasting energy in moving around or fighting with them . 
a few years ago , following protests from animal welfare organizations , the commission of the european union has asked for a report to the standing committee of the eu on the methods . 
the conclusions of the report indicates that the animals suffer not able to move and boredom have nothing to do all day . 
of course , the simple common sense can come to the same conclusions . 
following the report , the eu has set the dates from which the confinement of farm animals will be banned . 
for calves , on 1 january 2007 . 
the stalls for sows , already banned in the uk and in sweden , will be banned from 2013 throughout the european union . 
measures to improve the welfare of laying hens , in battery cages with wire without enough room to stretch their wings , are also being gradually . 
in the united states , nothing of the kind is planned . 
previously , when my european friends asked me why the us accused such a delay in the welfare of animals compared to europe , i have had no answer . 
if they insisted , i had to admit that a possible explanation was that the americans care less about animals than europeans . 
then , in 2002 , animal welfare advocates put a proposal to ban sow stalls on the ballot in florida . 
to everyone 's surprise , the proposal was accepted by 55 percent of the voters . 
last month in arizona , despite well-funded opposition by the food industry , the ban containment of pens for veal calves and pigs has also been approved , by 62 percent of voters . 
neither florida nor arizona are particularly progressive states -- both voted for george w. bush over john kerry in 2004 . 
the results of these two votes strongly suggest that if all americans had to decide on the maintenance of pregnant sows and veal in containment , a large majority object . 
in the end , americans seem to care as much as europeans the living conditions of farmed animals . 
to explain the difference between the welfare of animals in europe and the us , it is without doubt compare the political systems . 
in europe , the concerns of voters about the living conditions of animals have found resonance among members of national parliaments and the european parliament , with the result the adoption of national laws and eu directives to improve their fate . 
in the us , by contrast , these same concerns have had no discernible effect on members of congress . 
there is no federal legislation on the welfare of animals and virtually no state legislation . 
because agribusiness my opinion , the tens of millions of dollars of the food industry pocketed by the representatives seeking to be re-elected is for something . 
the animal welfare movement , despite strong popular support , is not the weight in the arena of political lobbying and campaign donations . 
in us electoral politics , money matters more than the opinions of voters . 
party discipline is weak , and congressmen must themselves raise most of the funds needed for their re-election -- in this case , every two years for members of the house of representatives . 
in europe , where party discipline is strong and the parties , not the candidates , finance election campaigns , money plays a smaller role . 
in the united states , a country proud of its democratic tradition , calves and pigs are hardly the only losers . 
what 's new on the new army entirely composed of afghans ? 
the assassination of afghan minister of aviation by a mob ( perhaps incited by members of afghanistan 's own interim administration ) shows that afghan society remains deeply showing cracks . 
the first reforms to the afghan army will only exacerbate these divisions . 
the minister of defense of hamid karzai 's temporary administration in kabul has already named the top officers of this new army . 
the minister , general mohammed fahim , is a tajik the panjshir district in the north , which has become three months earlier the leader of the forces of the northern alliance which captured kabul , after american bombers their cleared the way . 
as a group , his appointments is a direct challenge to the goal of reunification of the country of mr. . karzai . 
afghanistan is a multi-ethnic nation , the largest group being pashtuns , who represent the two fifths of the total population . 
the hazars and tajiks constitute about a fifth of the population . 
on the thirty-eight high to the rank of general , by mr. . fahim , thirty-seven are tajiks , the other being uzbek . 
if , on the 15 to 17 million pashtuns in the country , some are recruited as soldiers , they will serve under a command structure almost entirely of tajiks . 
the pashtuns " language is different , however , of the tajik as spanish and english , and millions of pashtuns of military age only a smattering of tajik . 
the geographical profile of the new military leadership is also restricted as its ethnic makeup . 
thirty-five of the 38 senior officers hail from a small area north of kabul consisting of parwan province ( where the bagram airport is located ) and near the panjshir valley , long the stronghold of the northern alliance . 
in other words , potential leaders from 27 of the 29 provinces of afghanistan have been excluded from the new military elite of their country . 
a group so restricted could perhaps overcome the impression that its members are a closed clique if they represented a broad cross-section of the dozen political parties in the country . 
but this is not the case . 
eighteen of the 38 senior officers come from one party , the jamiat-e-islami , the islamic faction that has long been led by mullah and former theology professor burhanuddin rabbani . 
it was this party that ruled kabul briefly in the mid-1990s , creating the bloodshed and chaos that caused most afghans to welcome the arrival of the taliban . 
the communists almost equaling the number of jamiat members in the military hierarchy . 
sixteen of the thirty-eight have long been aligned with this party , whose tricks at the end of the 1970s led to the soviet invasion of 1979-89 which cost two and a half million afghan lives . 
most afghans today view the communists with the same degree of sympathy that the czechs and poles reserve for hitler 's national socialists . 
it is true that the afghans , as elsewhere , joined the communist party for various reasons , and that they were by no means all of hard-core ideologues . 
but in the case of general fahim 's generals , six were professional communist party workers , and continued to serve the party after the invasion of the red army . 
these six men , plus three more communists who served as officers in the afghan army , have worked actively during the soviet occupation of afghanistan , which lasted for a decade . 
imagine how the french would have reacted if a quarter of the body of french officers of the post-world war ii had sided with the wehrmacht during its occupation of their country . 
in afghanistan , the new travel quickly by word of mouth . 
afghan nationalists ( that is , almost all afghans ) will soon discover the political reasons members of general fahim 's inner circle , if this is not already done so . 
even this overwhelming evidence of partiality and bias in the formation of the new army 's high command could be overridden if the generals brought professionalism and commitment to the patriotic values of a truly national armed forces in their task . 
unfortunately , only ten of the thirty-eight promoted by fahim have received a formation of professional military officers . 
an eleventh served as a pilot . 
by contrast , 24 of the total ( the backgrounds of the remaining four are unknown ) are civilians , who had a profession , who come from the offices of the communist party or , in one case , mullah . 
what do all these statistics mean in terms of day-to-day reality ? 
they mean that when the heads of the international peacekeeping forces in afghanistan , as well as the military and diplomatic officials , meet afghanistan 's deputy minister of defence , they will encounter abdul rashid dostum , a warlord and communist notoriously brutal and corrupt , which remains in touch with old friends of the red army still serving in moscow . 
this means that the head of the afghan armed forces , as well as the head of operations and the head of the intelligence service of the army are also communists , men whose loyalties remain uncertain and which many afghans were wary . 
this team has opportunities to unify war-torn afghanistan together ? 
the presence in kabul of a team so dubious opportunities to instill confidence in the three-quarters of the afghan population who are excluded from the military high command ? 
or is this list , rather the harvest of an approach " everything for the winner " of the government which is obliged ( at a certain point in the future ) to unleash another bloody national backlash by those whose legitimate interests have been cynically trampled ? 
the un and the european politicians and americans must ponder these questions before agreeing to a ruthless power grab by a small minority unpopular . 
celebration of the irrational 
hooray for the new nobel laureates in economy : daniel kahneman of princeton university , and vernon smith of george mason university in virginia . 
like many nobel prizes , these awards recognize not only the seminal work undertaken by kahneman and smith , but also the schools of thought that they have helped to develop . 
kahneman , a psychologist , has demonstrated that individuals systematically behave in ways less rational than traditional economists believe it to be . 
his research shows not only that individuals sometimes act differently standard economic theories predict , but also that they do it regularly , systematically , and in a way that can be understood and interpreted through different assumptions , competing with those used by the traditional economists . 
for most market players , and in fact , ordinary observers , this does not seem to make much difference . 
wall street brokers who peddled the actions that they know to be wrong exploit the irrationality that kahneman and smith have shown . 
a large part of the mania that led to the economy was based on the exploitation of the psychology of investors . 
in fact , this irrationality is not new for economists , either . 
john maynard keynes once referred to the stock market as not being based on rational individuals struggling to discover the foundations of the markets , but rather as a beauty contest in which the winner is the one who best guess what the judges will say . 
this year 's nobel prize celebrates the criticism of the market economy simplistic , like that of last year ( that i have received with two other colleagues ) . 
last year 's laureates emphasis on the fact that different market participants have different ( and imperfect ) information , and that this asymmetry of information have profound impact on the functioning of the economy . 
more particularly , last year 's laureates implied that the markets are not usually effective ; that there is an important role for government to play . 
adam smith 's invisible hand , the idea that free trade leads to efficiency as if by an invisible hand , is invisible in part because it is not there . 
this , too , is not news to those who work on a daily basis with the markets ( and make their fortunes by taking advantage of this information asymmetry and overcoming ) . 
for more than 20 years , economists have passionate for these so-called rational expectations " models " who assumed that all the players have the same information ( albeit imperfect ) and are acting perfectly rational , that markets are perfectly efficient , that there is never any unemployment ( except when it is caused by greedy unions or minimum wages imposed by the governments ) , and that there is never any rationing of funding . 
such models are dominant , particularly in postgraduate courses in the united states , despite all evidence to the contrary which show the triumph of ideology on science . 
unfortunately , students of these programmes of higher education today are the decision makers in many countries , and they are trying to implement programs based on these ideas , the so-called today market fundamentalism . 
let me be clear : the rational expectations models have contributed significantly to economic theory ; the rigor that their supporters imposed on economic thinking has highlighted the weakness of many underlying assumptions . 
good science recognizes its limits , but the prophets of rational expectations have generally shown little modesty . 
vernon smith is a leader in the development of experimental economics , the idea that you can test many economic proposals in a laboratory . 
one of the reasons that the economy is a subject if complex , which also explains the many disagreements among economists , is that economists cannot conduct controlled experiments . 
nature throws the real-life experiences , but in most circumstances , so many things change so quickly that it is often difficult to disentangle the causes of the consequences . 
in principle , in a laboratory , we can conduct controlled experiments , and therefore make more reliable inferences . 
critics of experimental economics worry that the subjects bring to experimental situations modes of thought determined outside of the experience , and that the experiences and the inferences are not as clear and that in the physical sciences . 
however , the economic experiments bring a certain knowledge of a number of important issues , such as the improved design of auctions . 
above all , the irrationality of market participants , the main issue of kahneman 's work , has verified repeatedly in the context of laboratories . 
one of the more amusing results by experimental economics is altruism and selfishness . 
it appears ( at least in experimental situations ) that experimental subjects are not as selfish that economists believe , except for one group : economists themselves . 
is it because the economy is a discipline attracts individuals who are , by nature , selfish or because the economy helps shape individuals making them more selfish ? 
the answer , surely , is a little bit of both . 
there is no doubt that the experimental research and the future work will resolve the question of the relative importance of these two hypotheses . 
the nobel prize shows just how important it is to study the individuals and economies as they are and not as we want to see them . 
it is only by understanding better actual human behavior that we can expect design policies that will also do better function our economies . 
bush and his energy policy of bad faith 
one of the more surreal happened , this year , during the world economic forum in davos . oil industry experts have said that the melting of the polar ice cap -- much more quickly than anyone anticipated ¬≠ -- is not only a problem , but also a chance in that vast amounts of oil will now be accessible . 
in the same way , these experts acknowledged that the refusal of the united states signed the law of the sea , the international convention that determines access to offshore oil and other mineral resources maritime , presents a risk of international conflict . 
however , they have also insisted on the advantages : the oil industry , in its relentless pursuit of new reserves , does not need to beg congress for the right to plunder alaska . 
president george w. bush has an uncanny ability not to understand the important messages . 
for years , it is increasingly clear that its energy policy is not right . 
some members of his own party referred to a former energy bill drafted by the oil industry , as being very advantageous for all lobbyists . 
while praising the virtues of the market economy , the only purpose of bush is to give huge subsidies to the oil industry , despite increasing deficits the country faces . 
however , the market is not working properly when it comes to energy . the intervention of the government should take a sense totally opposed to the one that the bush administration has proposed . 
the fact that americans do not pay the price of pollution -- and above all of their huge production of greenhouse gases -- resulting from their energy waste leads to a devaluation of the prices of energy and the sudden , excessive consumption . 
the government needs to encourage energy savings . his speech on price-fixing , through taxes on energy , is an efficient way to do it . 
but , instead of the energy savings , bush has pursued a policy of " drain america first " of its own resources , making it in the future even more dependent on external oil . 
no matter that high demand drives up the price of oil and creating a windfall for many countries of the middle east , which are not the best friends of america . 
now , more than four years after the terrorist attacks of september 2001 , it seems that bush has finally taken the measure of the growing energy dependency of america . it was hard for him not to see the consequences of the soaring price of oil . 
but , again , his administration 's faltering moves are bound to worsen the problems in the immediate future . 
bush still refuses to act in favour of energy savings and finally spent very little money to support his continuing prayer of technological salvation . 
what , then , to make of bush 's recent declaration on its commitment to reduce , in the 25 years ago , oil dependency of america on the middle east of 75 % ? 
for investors , the message is clear : do not invest more in the new reserves in the east , which is by far the least expensive oil resources in the world . 
however , if there is no new investment in the middle east reserves , unbridled growth in energy consumption in the united states , china and elsewhere implies that demand outstrips supply . 
and to top it all , bush 's threat of sanctions against iran could lead to the termination of the supply of one of the world 's largest producers . 
with a global level of oil production close to maximum and prices has almost doubled since the war in iraq , this portends still higher prices , and still more profits for the oil industry , the only real winner of bush 's middle east policy . 
in any case , nobody should blame bush for having acknowledged that there was a problem . 
but , as always , his proposals are nothing more than a little trick of his administration . 
in addition to his refusal to admit the warming of the planet , to encourage energy savings or allocate sufficient funds for further research , the great promise for bush to reduce dependence on middle east oil does not mean much . 
with only 20 % of american oil coming from the middle east , the goal could be achieved by increasing modestly supply from other parts of the world . 
the bush administration must realize that oil is taking advantage of the global market . 
even if america was completely independent of middle east oil , the reduction of energy production of this region would have devastating effects on global prices and certainly on the us economy . 
as is too often the case with the bush administration , there is no clear explanation of the official policy . 
is bush to play with the policy waving anti-arab and anti-iranian sentiment of the americans ? 
or is this just another example of incompetence and confusion ? 
depending on what we have seen over the past five years , the correct answer probably contains more than a little bad faith and sheer foolishness . 
the roadmap of china 
china is about to adopt its 11th five-year plan , setting the stage for extend what is probably the most remarkable economic transformation of history , while improving the well-being of almost a quarter of the world 's population . 
never before has the world seen such sustained growth ; never before has there been such a reduction of poverty . 
the explanation of the long-term success of china is partly in its unique combination of pragmatism and vision of the future . 
while much of the rest of the developing world , following the washington consensus , is launched on a quest for higher gdp don quixote , china has once again made clear that it sought sustainable and more equitable increases in levels of real life . 
china realizes that it has entered a phase of economic growth imposing huge demands on the environment , which cannot last . 
at least to change trajectory , living standards will eventually be compromise . 
it is for this reason that the new five-year plan puts great emphasis on the environment . 
many of the more backward parts of china have been growing at a pace that marvel , were it not for the wonder if other parts of the country are growing even more rapidly . 
while this has reduced poverty , inequality has increased , with growing disparities between rural and urban areas , and between coastal regions and the interior . 
the report of this year 's world bank world development report explains why inequality , and not just poverty , should raise concern , and china 's 11th five-year plan tackles the problem head-on . 
the government has for several years talked about a more harmonious society , and the plan describes ambitious programs to reach that goal . 
china also recognises that what separates the least developed countries of the most developed countries is not only a disparity in resources , but also of knowledge . 
so it has laid out bold projects to reduce these disparities and create a basis for independent innovation . 
the role of china in the world and in the global economy has changed , and the plan also reflects this situation . 
its future growth will have to be based more on domestic demand than on exports , which means an increase in consumption . 
indeed , china is suffering from a rare problem : excessive savings . 
people save partly because of shortcomings in the programmes of social insurance of government : to strengthen social security ( pensions ) , public health and education will simultaneously reduce social inequalities , increase the sense of well-being of the citizens and promote current consumption . 
if this works ( and , so far , china has almost always surpassed even his own high expectations ) these adjustments may impose enormous pressure on a global economic system already destabilized by the enormous fiscal and trade imbalances united states . 
if china saves less -- and if , as officials have announced , it pursues a more diversified policy of investing its reserves , which will fund the trade deficit of more than $ 2 billion a day from the united states ? 
this is a topic for another day , but that day may not be far off . 
with such a clear vision of the future , the challenge will be implementation . 
china is a great country , which would not have been able to do so as well without widespread decentralization . 
but the decentralization raises problems of its own . 
greenhouse gases , for example , are global problems . 
while america says that it does not have the resources to do anything about it , the most senior chinese officials have acted more responsibly . 
in the space of a month after the adoption of the plan , new environmental taxes on cars , petrol and wood products were imposed : china uses market mechanisms to resolve its environmental problems and those of the world . 
but the pressures on local government officials to create economic growth and jobs will be enormous . 
they will be very tempted to say that if america is not capable of producing way to protect our planet , how can we ? 
to translate that vision into action , the chinese government will need strong policies , particularly significant increases taxes on the environment . 
while china became a market economy , it has developed some problems that are the scourge of developed countries : specific interests concealing personal interests under a mask of market ideology . 
some will trickle-down economics : do not worry for the poor , eventually everybody will benefit from the growth . 
and others will oppose competition policy and strong corporate governance laws : let darwinism operate its wonders . 
growth arguments will be advanced to counter strong social and environmental policies : for example , raise taxes on gasoline will kill our nascent auto industry . 
such allegedly pro-growth policies would not only to provide growth , they would threaten the entire vision of the future of china . 
there is only one way to prevent this : open discussion of economic policies in order to expose fallacies and provide the means to implement creative solutions for the many challenges facing china today . 
george w. bush has shown it is dangerous to abuse the secrecy and restrict the decision-making to a narrow circle of sycophants . 
most people outside china do not realise how its leaders , by contrast , have engaged in extensive deliberations and extensive consultations ( even with foreigners ) as they strive to solve the enormous problem they face . 
market economies are not self-regulating . 
they cannot simply be left on autopilot , especially if one wants to ensure that their profits are widely shared . 
but managing a market economy is not easy . 
it is a balancing act that must constantly respond to economic changes . 
china 's 11th five-year plan provides a roadmap in this direction . 
the world watches , full of hope and fear , as the lives of 1,3 billion people continue to be processed . 
the lessons on democracy de tocqueville 
the fact of the war in iraq , 200 years after the birth of tocqueville , the world is discussing the nature of democracy . 
tocqueville is justly famous for having rejected reactionary nostalgia in recital that democracy was our destiny , while warning against the dangers that it holds for freedom . 
should we share his concern ? 
tocqueville viewed democracy not only as a political system , but , above all , as an intellectual system that shapes the habits and customs of society , giving it a sociological and psychological dimension . 
tocqueville believed that the democratic regimes guide our thoughts , our desires and passions . 
just as there has been renaissance man and , in the twentieth century , homo sovieticus , " democratic man " is a form of human being . 
for tocqueville , democracy 's systemic effects can lead people to abandon their faculty of reasoning . 
they can only pretend to judge events and values for themselves , when in fact they simply repeat the restrictive views of the majority . 
what tocqueville called the stranglehold of the " social power " on opinion is probably strongest in democratic systems - a view that was the level of demagoguery and manipulation by the media in the modern world . 
tocqueville believed that in the long term , nothing can really object to this trend . 
neither local democracy nor small groups inside the company , or the checks and balances , and civil rights cannot prevent the decline of critical thought that democracy seems to cause . 
the school is at best an enclave in the shelter of the influence irresistible that society exercises on the spirit . 
in the same way , tocqueville believed that research of virtue in the manner of the old or a religious faith , could sometimes elevate the soul , but one and the other are incompatible with the democratic ideal where they are imposed by the authorities in public life . 
in this sense , the neo-marxist theorists school of frankfurt and hannah arendt who feared above all the disappearance of reason in modern societies are the heirs of the thought of tocqueville . 
you can also be noted that the french philosopher marcel gauchet entitled a recent book democracy against itself . 
for these authors , the democratic way of life tends to eliminate original thought and to prevent the emergence of a culture of good level , yielding a mediocrity that leaves citizens vulnerable to enemies of democracy . 
if history is replete with murderous regimes supported by cowed and deceived masses , the greatest risk of democratic countries is that their citizens sink into apathy and short-term thinking , in search of their immediate interest . 
the past - despite the rituals that seek to commemorate historic events - is masked by the addiction to the now and the new . 
even the supposedly well-educated ruling class , is the victim of this grip . 
the main problem with the democratic mentality is its lack of historical consciousness . 
as tocqueville claimed , do the defects of democracy resigned pessimism is the only way - realistic but unacceptable - which is open to us ? 
i think not . 
there are ways to combat what might be called the " democratic stupidity " spread today . 
the first of these resources is to develop an education system which form of real critical minds , in particular through the largely neglected subjects of ( these days ) that literature , history , and philosophy . 
if you want to train informed citizens and capable of thinking for themselves , which is essential to the functioning of democracy , our schools must stop the latest popular fads and begin to develop the analytical capabilities of pupils . 
because of their tendency to cultivate superficiality and distraction , the mass media are the main obstacle to such an education . 
today , many people spend more time during their lives in front of the tv in a classroom . 
the passivity that the mass media encourages is the exact opposite of the active involvement of citizens , necessary to democracy . 
but it is difficult to imagine that the mass media ( other than quality newspapers ) to accept their own volition , become instruments of an education that enhances the critical spirit of citizens . 
this focus on the mass media is not an elitist scorn for popular culture . 
it is not just a question of popularity - mozart was popular in his day , and shakespeare 's plays attracted the poor as well as the rich - but of mass culture 's refusal to question and provoke . 
the result is a passive indifference and widespread public . 
for a long time , a globalized media culture , increasingly , unable to create any critical or raise the sentiments . 
the fact of his lack of interest in these questions , it is a culture that threatens democratic freedoms because it failed to create any sense of duty to society , history or the community . 
is it too late to defend itself against a culture that √©mousse at this point the minds ? 
tocqueville despised the elites of his time because of their complacency about the dangers of mass democracy . 
the myopia of our leaders it will promote the achievement of his disquieting prophecy ? 
a europe for all 
longtime members of the european union seem to doubt the future of the european union , but the ukrainians look at the european union with hope and admiration . 
the fundamental objective of our foreign policy is to join in the european progress , because ukraine has discovered that national autonomy is not an end in itself but a beginning . 
indeed , european unity is indivisible : when a nation is a victim of ostracism , no nation is free . 
we europeans are connected by a link which we cannot escape , linked in a single garment of destiny . 
all aspects of culture that we share , not to mention the century of suffering that we have just share , we confirm this . 
anything that affects one european directly affects us all indirectly . 
we can never afford to live with the narrow notion of two europes , of haves and have-nots , elected representatives and outsiders . 
anyone who lives on the european continent cannot , must not be seen as a stranger to its union . 
the great pax europa today , just as the current pan-european prosperity depends on it . 
some may say , of course , that ukraine is not part of europe . 
they come to kiev and meet its people , young and old , workers , the wives of farmers , lawyers and doctors and teachers who stood and stayed in the cold and snow for weeks during last winter to defend their freedoms . 
are they not united with those who stood alongside general de gaulle in the french resistance ? 
are they not with those who died fighting for the spanish republic in the 1930s , those who liberated budapest in 1956 and ended fascism in spain and portugal in the 1970s ? 
are they not animated by the same spirit as poland 's solidarity trade union and the peaceful masses that created the velvet revolution in prague in 1989 ? 
this is the true european spirit , and no doubt will not destroy it . 
all those who consider that ukraine is too backward to become a member of the union , i say : let them also visit my country and see the mothers who stay until late in the office to teach their children to use the computer of their office . 
they come to the language classes in every village and town where our youth is preparing for europe in learning french , german and english . 
those who doubt the european vocation of ukraine should understand that europe is not a matter of hardware and motorways : it is the insatiable desire for freedom , prosperity and solidarity . 
i believe that our future is as promising as europe 's past is proud , and that our destiny is not that of a land border forgotten in a troubled region , but as a peace and unity of europe . 
self-determination is no longer synonymous with insulation because achieving national independence of our days simply means the return on the world stage with a new status . 
the new nations can build with their former occupiers the same kind of fruitful relationship that france has established with germany : a relationship based on equality and mutual interests . 
this is the kind of relationship that my government wants to establish with russia , that is how we can help extend the zone of peace in europe . 
of course , it is premature to go beyond the indication of the utmost importance that we attach to the possibility of joining the european union . 
we know that our role in this great edifice will not a night . 
we know that the great works of european unification are not limited to the documents and statements , but in innovative action designed to improve the living standards and bring security to all europeans . 
building a ukraine worthy of joining the european union will not be easy , nor quick or without effort . 
but just as the european union itself , it will be built and it will happen . 
we know that the challenge is great , but this is worthwhile and europe must understand that this is our goal . 
the renovation of ukraine happening in part by a creative battle to end a nightmarish century during which fascism and communism , ideologies born in the heart of europe , clashed for taking power . 
through the ukrainian cited a few months ago , parents and children faced armed troops , snarling dogs , and even death . 
only a few years ago , a young journalist , georgy gongadze , seeking to inform the public on the corruption of our former regime , was brutalized and beheaded by the henchmen of the regime . 
our orange revolution , last winter , has proved that ukraine and its people prevailed . 
thus , despite the doubts and difficulties , i retain an abiding faith in europe . 
i refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities and horrors of ukraine 's history . 
i refuse to accept the idea that ukraine is so tragically condemned to live at the heart of the night without stars of the communist legacy that we can never see the point of the day peace and true european unity . 
when the citizens of the european union to consider ukraine 's place in europe , they should look closely and know to look beyond the face they see . 
see beyond the devastated areas that we communism inflicted , beyond poverty and social divisions through which our discarded ex-leaders sought to extend their grip . 
they should look closely at the face of our president , viktor yushchenko , ravaged by poison during the election campaign last year , and remember the words of the great french andr√© malraux , for whom " the most beautiful faces are those that have been wounded . " 
the muslim civil war 
the gap between sunnis and shiites in the middle east is it now deeper than the antagonism between israel and the arabs ? 
you could believe in seeing the reaction of some arab governments to hezbollah 's decision to attack israel . 
while israeli bombs fell on beirut and tyre , saudi arabia , perhaps the most conservative arab muslim state of all , openly condemned the actions of the shiite hezbollah which initiated the conflict against israel . 
never before in the history of the arab-israeli conflict , a state that considers itself the leader of the arab muslim peoples had supported israel so openly . 
in addition , the breakdown of saudi arabia with hezbollah is not a unique case . 
egypt and jordan have also roundly condemned hezbollah and its leader , sheik hassan nasrallah , for their adventurism . 
what is behind this stunning situation ? 
are we experiencing a fundamental shift in relations between arab nationalism and islamic sectarianism ? 
saudi arabia 's sunni government more concerned and frightened by shia islam that it is committed to arab unity and the palestinian cause ? 
arab denunciations of hezbollah suggest that the muslim sectarian divide , already evident in the daily violence in iraq , is deepening and intensifying across the middle east . 
president george w. bush 's desire to destroy the arab world 's frozen societies was sentenced to draw up the forces of modernization against the traditional elements of the arab and islamic societies . 
it seems instead having freed most atavistic forces in the region . 
the opening of this pandora 's box has been able to give birth to an even uglier era of widespread violence , what can only be called without doubt that " muslim civil war . " 
the shia-sunni divide has existed since the dawn of the history of islam , but the geographical and ethnic isolation of non-arab shiite iran , as well as the dominance of their shia minorities by sunni arab countries , has generally kept this rivalry in the background . 
these tensions further receded in the wave of " islamisation " created by the iranian revolution , because in its wake the identity sectarian sunni arabs has been pushed further into the background as a generalized " islamic " assertiveness appeared . 
that all changed when al qaeda , a sunni terrorist group that draws heavily on saudi wahabbi ideology and personnel , launched its attacks on america in september 2001 . 
a specifically sunni branch of militant islam was underway . 
when the united states have launched wars on both the sunni taliban in afghanistan and the sunni iraqi regime , this new radical sunni strain became even more emboldened . 
sunni arabs in the region , who have now won in insurance , see israel and the west as a single threat , the other comprising the so-called " shia crescent " -- the arc of earth which stretches of lebanon to iran through syria and iraq , inhabited by the allegedly heretical shia . 
the leaders of saudi arabia , as guardians of the holy sites of the muslim faith of mecca and medina , perhaps feel this threat with more acute . 
for the sunnis , shias not only dominate the oil-rich areas of iran , iraq , and the regions of the saudi arabia , they are also trying , by acts of hezbollah , to usurp the role of " protector " of the central dream of all arabs , the palestinian cause . 
this is because the saudi royal family derives its legitimacy from a strict form of sunni islam and casting doubt on the loyalty of its shia population that the kingdom deviates from the hezbollah . 
ironically , it is that america , protective of saudi arabia , has made the shia empowerment possible by overthrowing saddam hussein and bringing shiite parties in power in iraq . 
the bush administration seems to recognize what it has done ; as the shia arc rises in the east of the arab muslim world , the united states are trying to consolidate their protection of the sunni arc -- egypt , jordan and saudi arabia -- to the west of the region . 
israel , once implacable enemy of the arab cause , now seems to be slotted into this defensive structure . 
but such a defensive posture is necessarily unstable , by the mere fact of panarabes feelings . 
today , ordinary saudi citizens are glued to al jazeera and other arab satellite tv networks to follow events in gaza and in southern lebanon . 
they see the blood shiite arab ( not ) , and only hezbollah respond . 
for them , hezbollah has become a heroic model of resistance . 
this is causing the saudi state to deepen the sunni-shia schism . 
after official denunciation of hezbollah by the kingdom , the saudi state has asked its official wahhabi clerics to issue fatwas condemning hezbollah as shiite deviants and heretics . 
such sentences can only exacerbate sectarian divisions within saudi arabia and the region . 
before the escalation of these antagonism , the sunni regimes come to believe that they need their own hezbollah to fight in their corner ? 
if they come to this conclusion , they need not look far , for the fighters of this type have already trained - by al qaeda . 
why europe can no longer ignore georgia 
the time when europe could rely on america to make war , restore peace and democracy in its own backyard is over . 
with enlargement of the european union , and as demonstrated by the recent russian gas crisis , this court now includes not only ukraine but also georgia . 
indeed , in georgia , as in ukraine , democracy is put to the test , and europe cannot afford to ignore . 
georgia was the first country in the post-soviet space to operate a " color revolution , " and thus to demonstrate , with dignity and maturity , its people 's choice in favour of democracy and european values . 
the european union flags that have flown on all georgian public buildings since then clearly show the natural attachment , as old as the history of this country that , for the ancient greeks , was an integral part of the world of the time . 
prometheus , medea , the amazons and in neighboring armenia , noah 's ark are all signs that europe of our myths starts here . 
with its history , culture , traditions , old but also more recent , when georgia differed from other republics of the former soviet union , its critical , independent and even rebellious , georgia is probably even today the location of this area , where the democratic transplant can take the better . 
it is therefore all the more worrying to see the democratisation of the country under threat . 
everything seemed to have started well enough . 
with the launch without dissent a policy reforms , privatization , fight against corruption , the search for new leaders and untainted by compromise with the previous regime , the implementation of a foreign policy marked by a return of europe in the georgian game . 
the totalitarian mindset has since resurfaced in leaders who , proclaiming the representatives of the majority , have appropriated more powers . 
this is like the hydra never ends to die and rise from the ashes . 
they and their methods of power that the " rose revolution " of november 2003 sought to defeat were reintroduced into the heart of power , with the aid of their networks , with ramifications including outside the borders , their tremendous scheming , their skill and the manipulation of political and electoral appliances . 
this is a power that does not sufficiently respect the essence of democracy , which is not in the ballot box , but in the separation of powers . 
every day , the government to interfere in the legislature , the vast majority of the laws is writing to the presidential chancellery ; parliament wants to control the daily exercise of government policy , including , in my case , the appointment of ambassadors and their daily routines ! 
finally , and this is the most serious , the judiciary still fails to kick the guardianship of the executive and is no longer or not yet for the citizen or the investor the guarantor and protector , without which there is no rule of law and economic freedom 
it is a society that is to be democratic in his head , is not yet in its legs . it is still reluctant to engage in politics leaving the stage to those who care for too long . 
because this democracy is in danger of collapsing , but because it is still there , located strongly in the population , in civil society organizations , media but which does not lose his faculty criticism ... 
this is the moment for europe to save democracy in order not extinguished . 
the united states have already done what they could have since independence , and they are alongside the stability of georgia . 
the stability definitely was not identified in the democracy under the rule of eduard shevardnadze , the former soviet union foreign minister that the rose revolution has removed from his post as president of georgia . 
but the americans have invested very generously in the survival of georgian elites and in their learning of democracy . 
the criticism of the initiatives soros , today at the preconditions : the revolution in november was not created by the americans , not withstanding the russian nationalists used to direct interventions to think differently , but the democratic substrate which has certainly nurtured , encouraged and supported by the aid of the soros foundation . 
the course that must be taken today for georgia his body -- this time consolidate requires support of a different nature , that europeans are more capable of providing . 
the models that need to be proposed for the balance of power , the institutions of state of law , the functioning of the judiciary and local democracy must be inspired by european forms closer to georgian reality that the anglo-saxon model , american variant . 
if europe today rejected this task , it would betray his fundamental duty against this country , small , mediterranean , flexible , long historical tradition , where democracy has a better chance of success than in ukraine , which is both huge soviet and still very in his mind , not to mention central asia . 
not help georgia is accept that democracy would come not only in tbilisi , but even more in kiev , minsk , to say nothing of moscow . 
it is , above all , take a very serious risk . 
moscow which , with ups and downs , while interior , began to resign itself to the inevitability of democracy , at least on its margins , not without renouncing its imperial dreams and their instruments of domination , perception . 
but this hesitant acceptance of normality in its relations with its neighbours , which was in its infancy , can be hoisted by a sudden eruption of the irrationality of russian power of this " derzhava " which cannot resist the lure of weakness , to the temptation to again be not equal , but the strongest . 
this is what explains the recent russian gas crisis . 
any sign of a retreat from democracy of the democratic wave , will be taken by moscow as a sense of hope reversibility where gradually russia accoutumait to no longer believe . 
it is the responsibility of europe to convince russia that there is no hope of a return to the past . 
europe has this responsibility for itself , its future energy independence . it also has the responsibility to show that there are also strong european values -- of freedom , democracy , justice between peoples . 
for that europe must provide the instruments of its policy : a great public private foundation for europe and democracy , a university to train future executives of democracies , a police force , an army of judges and magistrates who do live models that we want to convert . 
above all , europe needs conviction . 
if europe today cannot convince itself that it is interested in the fate of its neighbours , democracy and the future of its values , who will believe in it tomorrow ? 
berlusconi beleaguered 
silvio berlusconi , who will become president of the european union on 1 july , is a man of vision who once loved risks and whose business bets paid profitable . in the 1960s , it was the first to see that milan , then a traditional italian city where people walked to work , would become a modern metropolis , surrounded by the outskirts of american style . 
he then built his fortune in real estate development . 
fifteen years later , mr. . berlusconi saw that the monopoly held by the italian state on television would not survive and jump-started what will become the first private media group of italy . 
but it would not have been able to do both in the tv and the real estate if it was not the right political connections . 
in both cases , berlusconi has prevailed on its competitors by siding with the socialists , at the time the rising stars of italian politics . 
his long association with bettino craxi , milan 's most influential politician in the 1970s and the prime minister of italy in a large part of the 1980s , started early . 
on the other hand , political relations are not enough to become a politician . 
indeed , the jump from trade to politics was certainly not part of the wishes of berlusconi . 
his media group , weakened by excessive diversification ( the decision to enter the distribution market almost destroyed ) , encountered difficulties in the 1990s . 
almost at the same time , former prime minister craxi fled to tunisia , pursued by the italian courts in the context of an investigation of corruption mani pulite in the vast network known as tangentopoli ( bribesville ) . 
the leak and the exile of craxi created a sense of loss among berlusconi in the reliable political backing it needed . 
so , he decided to become his own political sponsor . 
as has often been the case in italian history , berlusconi 's decision to form a new political party , forza italia ) a few months before the parliamentary elections of 1994 paid off handsomely . 
berlusconi 's lack of experience in politics drove the demise of its first government six months after . 
any other man as rich as berlusconi would probably have abandoned . 
but it remained and led the opposition for six years . 
in 2001 , its determination was rewarded with a clear victory and , more important , by a seemingly clear mandate for change . 
once again , berlusconi has probably had no choice : at the end of the 1990s , his association with the disgraced socialists had both politically and legally . 
his only hope to repel the magistrates was to control parliament and introduce new laws to stop the series of corruption trials he faces , a strategy that allows him to escape prosecution until his term ends . 
unfortunately , while berlusconi 's government is invariably short speeches , the legal provisions put in place to suspend its trials are among the few laws that have been taken during his two years in power . 
berlusconi 's performance in government is a combination of good intuition ( for example , the attempt to reform italian pensions in 1994 ) and poor implementation ( mainly by lack of courage , surprising as it seems . 
in 1994 , during his first term , he realized early on that italy should overhaul its pension system , and introduced bold legislation . 
but one general strike was enough to kill his reformist zeal . 
more recently , he courageously taken party for the united states in the war in iraq , against the majority of the country and its own political coalition . 
but soon he seemed scared by his own courage and it became an almost invisible ally . 
despite its rhetoric , berlusconi he did not go ( or has not been invited ) at the summit with president bush in the azores , where was made the final decision to go to war . 
with regard to the social reforms , he fought the unions , but he chose the wrong fight : the infamous " article 18 " of italy , which allows labor courts to restore an employee in his job if a judge believes he has been unjustly fired . 
but while article 18 is important in principle , it is almost irrelevant in practice . 
he has served only to provoke a confrontation with the unions to distract the government of social reforms far more important . 
contrary to what happened in 1994 , the current government of berlusconi remains , but those who hoped a revolution in favour of the free market will be disappointed . 
no significant tax reduction has been passed and pension reform is still waiting . 
berlusconi 's powerful finance minister , giulio tremonti , speaks often and fondly of the need to renew the government intervention in the economy ; no action is taken to prevent strikes in the public sector . 
moderate right-wing voters , who wanted an italian version ( namely , somewhat watered-down ) of the reagan / thatcher era are disillusioned . 
berlusconi tries to mask his inactivity frightening its voters , repeating again and again that the election of the moderate left would be tantamount to sign a pact with the devil ( namely , the communists ) . 
italians seem more intelligent , as has clearly demonstrated the outcome of the june administrative elections . 
why the courageous visionary of the 1960s and 1970s it has lost its shine ? 
this is partly explained by the fact that we are no longer in this context : berlusconi is 40 years and for the last ten years , he has lived in the world of roman politics . 
there he learned the art of political survival ( and personal ) , but he lost his vision and his taste for risk . 
close the technology gap european am√©ricano 
in the second half of the 1990s , the average annual growth rate of productivity in europe amounted to 0,7 % , while the us had 1,4 % . 
however , if we distinguish between the industries that produce information and communication technologies ( ict ) and those who simply use these technologies , it appears so that the productivity growth gap is almost entirely from the weakness of the european production sector of ict . 
annual productivity growth in sectors that are using the ict technologies averaged 0,63 % in the us between 1995 and 2000 against 0,41 % in europe . 
this confirms a well known fact : europe is less efficient than the us to conduct research , leading to innovations is because europe allocates fewer resources to research , or because the available resources are used less efficiently , or both . 
it is certain that total spending on research and development is lower in europe than in the us , but not by much . 
in the 1990s , the us devoted all the years 2,8 % of their gdp to research and development , against 2,3 % in germany , 2 % in the uk , and 1,9 % in france . 
european governments continue as to their habit to complain about the lack of fiscal resources to support research and development ( an argument far-fetched given the tiny part of spending on research in oversized ) european budgets , and each time that the european commission allows , subsidize the innovative companies or those who , according to them , are most likely to invest in research and development . 
france and italy , for example , demanded that the limits imposed the budget deficits of members of the euro zone by the stability and growth pact exclude public spending for research . 
similarly , the french government decided to bail out alstom , a company that developed a number of high-tech products , including the tgv , the french fast train , before it is not in bankruptcy . 
but it is unlikely that these two tactics to develop the european high-tech sector . 
why ? 
because the weakness in research is not , at least not essentially , a funding issue . 
subsidies will not produce efficient high-tech firms . 
first of all , the question of research . 
europe is lagging behind the us in every field : the number of patents , the number of nobel laureates , the number of researchers from other countries that it can draw . 
but the funding is only part of the problem . 
a euro spent on research in europe is less productive than a dollar spent in the us , and for two reasons : the motives and the demand for technology . 
we fear that additional spending not followed by a change of archaic university rules only serve to produce more waste , not more of discoveries . 
it would only increase the power , prestige and the resources of entrenched lobbies of established university professors who often prevent access and competition in their university . 
the demand for technology also plays an important role . 
it allows us to focus research , imposes deadlines , screens the results of the research and allows patents to market prices . 
without the incentives provided by beneficiaries of these results , research risks sliding , often without clear direction . 
we must recognise that this situation does not apply to all areas : the study of ancient greek fragments is valuable even if it rarely meets to a demand . 
but it is important in those areas , both theoretical and practical , which could serve as a basis for the production of new technologies : physics , biology , chemistry , technical , etc . 
but this is defense spending that is the main engine of the demand for research . 
most technological breakthroughs in the post-war period ( microchips to the internet to the new batteries for cellular phones developed for the us army in iraq ) had , at least at the beginning , a military application . 
cell phones , satellite tracking and high-resolution cameras are expensive , but fortunately for the industries that use them , their development costs have been partly borne by the government . 
one of the main reasons for the superiority of the us in research is the importance and the composition of defense expenditure . 
the pentagon 's budget is not only important : it represents more than half of all us government spending on research and development ; in france , defense spending is only around a quarter of the total . 
in 1999 , us spending on research and development related to the defence have reached 0,45 % of gdp , top of the uk and france , which have reached only half of that figure , with 0,26 % and 0,22 % , respectively . 
as the case suggests alstom , the french have a different model in mind . 
rather than to support research and development with large defense budgets , they prefer to do it directly by subsidising french high-tech firms . 
the official justification is that national defense budgets are too low to create the demand required to support research and development in high-tech sectors , while there is still no european defense budget . 
this is not a mere coincidence : if it is awarded in a spirit of competition , such a supra-national budget would winners and losers . 
but many european countries still refuse to accept that some of their high-tech firms might not be equal : they think it is better to preserve these companies thanks to generous subsidies , and in the meantime avoid the consolidation of eu defense budgets . 
by integrating its defence spending and increasing their importance , europe kills two birds with one stone . 
it would be more credible when it demands to be heard at international bargaining tables , particularly towards the united states , and it would stimulate scientific research . 
to achieve that , it must not maintain larger deficits , which simply involve higher taxes , but to cut spending in other areas of the budget . 
in other words : a sacrifice in the short term to a gain over the long term . 
debt to the american 
after almost 15 years of unprecedented growth - with only a brief slowdown in 2000 / 2001 - the us is heavily indebted abroad , to the tune of 25 % of gdp . 
with a current-account deficit now exceeding 5 % of gdp , us foreign debt is rising rapidly . 
but no country can accumulate debt forever , and this situation must therefore take end sooner or later . 
at the beginning of the year 1985 , when the of the us current account deficit reached $ 120 billion - equivalent to a third of the current deficit - the rest of the world stopped financing it . 
the dollar was so brutally devalued , 50 % compared to the deutschmark . 
europe has no interest in renewing this experience . 
in reality , the world does not have the means to an end - sudden - current-account deficit of the united states . 
without exports to the united states , the timid growth europe has seen during the past year would immediately disappear . 
the process may already be happening : the appreciation of the euro - of 1,20 1,30 dollar for dollar in the last few months - was enough to paralyse european growth for the end of this year . 
before the fall of the dollar , exports of the 25 eu member states were growing at 6,5 % per year , compared with 2 % for consumption and 3 % for investment . 
in japan , the recent recovery was almost entirely driven by exports . 
but the yen has value and too , seems to stop growing . 
while central banks worldwide are full of dollars and trade imbalances becoming worrying , there are three possible solutions . 
first , an increase of national savings in the united states . 
it is unlikely , at least in the near future , given the ambitious plans by president bush in tax matters and the continuation of the war in iraq . 
us private savings is also slightly negative , and an increase could lead to a slowdown in the short term . 
secondly , a more pronounced devaluation of the dollar , well above its current value relative to the euro and the yen . 
a revaluation of the chinese yuan would also be a good thing . 
thirdly , a resumption of growth in europe , which would cause a rise in us exports . 
it would require that european companies reduce costs and increase productivity . 
as always , it promises a whole range of " structural reforms , " but none is likely to be implemented soon . 
so , what to do ? 
one possibility would be to increase the working time without proportional increase of the hourly rate . 
in the early 1970s , we worked the same number of hours on both sides of the atlantic . 
today , in france and germany , are you working on average 50 % less than in the us . 
this is partly explained by a european taxation higher , and on this plan nothing is possible : it cannot be forced to work a person who believes that his salary after taxes is not the case . 
but the relative decline of working time is also due to the success of the unions , which have received compulsory vacation time . 
a reform in this area , for a longer working hours , would not reduce the total income of employees , but it would reduce production costs . 
this idea is beginning to be addressed in the press and , hopefully , backstage among politicians and the leaders of unions . 
in the meantime , the rest of the world has an interest in what the united states retain a current-account deficit without precedent , at a price of $ 500 billion per year . 
this allows the chinese to maintain the stability of their currency against the dollar , to remain extremely competitive , and nudge 200 million workers from agriculture to industry , the target of authorities for the next decade . 
in europe , america 's external deficit is the only source of growth . 
but this cannot continue . 
a day when the other , europe will have to stop thinking that the us can save its economy , and will rely on its own resources . 
but do not be surprised if the us and the depreciation of the dollar are accused of the next european downturn . 
a scapegoat is always useful . 
abba eban : the voice of israel 
for almost two generations , abba eban has represented the voice of israel by acting as his messenger to the conservatives and the powerful nations and of the jewish people of the world . 
since its first appearance at the side of dr. chaim weizmann at the end of the 1940s during the struggle for independence and sovereignty jewish , only a few people clearly the case also zionist jewish and with such eloquence and conviction . 
with his churchillian prose and almost shakespearean cadences , its m√©lodieuses phrases and his voice bombastic sent for decades the message of hope of a people who could have lost all hope and faith in humanity after the horrors of the second world war . 
as ambassador to the united states and the un , then as foreign minister , he represented an israel with which the world 's liberal imagination could identify . 
larger and more powerful nations were envious of so a powerful spokesman , and his speeches became examples for statesmen and diplomats in distant lands . 
his books , he found time to write despite the hectic demands of diplomacy , were a unique combination of enormous erudition and crystalline clarity . 
his college education and his donations to the rhetoric each other in a unique . 
rarely has a small country been represented by a statesman of such a scale : only thomas masaryk and jan smuts come the comparison . 
it was a true patriot , in the old-fashioned sense of the word : proud of his people , but never ethno-centric , man of the world , but deeply rooted in jewish cultural heritage , focused on the desperate situation and tribulations of the jewish people , but never losing the universal horizon of humanity . 
in a word , it was a modern jew in the best sense of the term . 
it has often been said that the prime minister spoke seven languages levi eshkol , all of them in yiddish . 
of eban , one could say that he was talking about ten and all with a focus of oxford / of cambridge . 
however , what appealed to the outside world was not always an advantage in the rough and tumble of the collapse of the israeli policy . 
eban was too urbane , too much of a scholar and gentleman to reach the hoist , like disraeli 's phrase , until the top of the greasy pole . 
together with golda meir and moshe dayan , it was obliged to leave the government in 1974 after of the yom kippur war . 
he could hardly be held responsible for the hubris which led to the avalanche of 1973 , but these nonetheless brought him down . 
it has never been able to return to power and when he was confronted with the new politics of primaries and populism , he became dispirited when he could not cope with this new style . 
in the international arena , eban 's pen sword , and the floor his lance . 
he was less adept in political infighting in israel . 
he could be a fierce turf fighter , but it is fair to say that it would have been able to fight harder for his moderate and dovish views in the post-1967 government in which he participated . 
it is not clear whether it would have prevailed , given his lack of an independent political base , but its prestige and its reputation at international level might have given him a chance if he had chosen to take up the gauntlet . 
he never did . 
the silence of eban in recent years was not only aroused by his disenchantment with israeli politics or his failing health . 
in a time when public debate in israel are torn between pseudo-religious nationalist fanatics and anti-zionists is as post-modernists , the moral certainties of eban , manners , can seem superficial . 
but a country , it is essential to have a certain moral strength and eban has offered in abundance to his people and the world . 
although it has passed several years since i talked to eban , i have no doubt that it would have been extremely sad to see the turn of events after the failure of the camp david talks and taba in 2000-2001 and conduct adopted by israeli policy him with foreboding . 
however , in all likelihood , it would have been even more disappointed by the inability of the palestinians to reach an agreement on the existence of the jewish state . 
as a pro-arab by its training , immersed in arab and muslim culture , he always hoped that the glorious arab past could be rejuvenated , that an arab and muslim culture of tolerance could triumph over fanaticism and extremism . 
this was the bedrock of his hope of reconciliation between jews and arabs . 
that this arab renaissance , to use the expression of the great palestinian scholar george antonius , has not seen the day would have been the biggest disappointment of eban . 
despite the image eban projected , it was extremely vulnerable : what some might regard sometimes traits of vanity could draw its source of his humble origins . 
while speaking in a very english , eban was not born in a castle : he came from a sliver of anglo-jewry . 
he was , in the true sense of the term , a self-made man , whose courage , ambition , drive and a deep faith in his destiny led to the summit . 
its the aristocracy of the spirit . 
in this abba eban was a true representative of the people he so gloriously represented . 
a practical guide to the israeli hawks 
prime minister ariel sharon 's announcement showing its willingness to dismantle jewish settlements in the gaza strip , as well as some settlements in the west bank , has shocked and wrong-footed the nation of israel and the nations of the world . 
many have denounced sharon 's plan as a trick . 
but this surprise was crazy since the beginning . 
despite the appearance that they give to foreigners , the debates in israel on the future of the occupied territories have never been reduced to a simple story of hawks and doves . 
like any thing in israel , the process is more complex , and particularly when the hawks are concerned . 
overall , there are two species of israeli hawks : the ideological and the strategic . 
ideological hawks view the occupied territories as an integral part of the historical land of israel , the homeland of the jewish people . 
for them , the territories are part of the jewish heritage , which explains their insistence to call on the west bank by its historic designation hebrew : judea and samaria . 
not all ideological hawks are religious , although those who are base their claim on divine promises and prophecies . 
but a lot of ideological hawks are secular nationalists , and their jargon is similar to that of the nationalists types of eastern europe and central europe . 
the former prime minister menachem begin and yitzhak shamir belonged to this category . 
ideological hawks usually come from the national party religious and the likud . 
they are inspired by the nationalist ideology associated with vladimir jabotinsky , who founded " revisionist " zionism in order to challenge the more moderate version passed by the founding fathers of israel , like chaim weizmann and david ben-gurion . 
then there are the strategic hawks . 
for them , given the narrow and vulnerable geographic shape israel and continuing arab enmity , control of the west bank and gaza is not an ideological imperative , but responds to security considerations . 
for them , jewish settlements in the occupied territories are not a return to historical lands , but security outposts , aimed at preventing ( or push for a place more strategic ) an attack at the heart of israel . 
this assessment of the situation may be right or wrong , but it is certainly not ideological . 
ariel sharon , who comes from a military background ( he grew up in a social environment which ideas much the labour party than jabotinsky ) , is a strategic hawk . 
for ideological hawks , the compromises are a betrayal : how jeopardising the historical heritage of the jewish people , not to mention god 's promise to abraham ? 
strategic hawks , however , are open to negotiations and the compromises practices , if the circumstances are right and if the security considerations justify it in their eyes . 
it is in this context that must be considered the measures taken by sharon . 
he was elected on the promise that he would bring peace and security . 
he has brought neither . 
with the defeat and the disappearance of saddam hussein , the danger of a " eastern front " against israel has weakened . 
without a palestinian partner , and due to continuing palestinian terrorism that the actions of israel 's fierce fail to quell the measures taken by sharon derive from this reflection geared towards the strategy : set up an effective barrier , move some of the isolated and strategically untenable settlements , and wait . 
the statements of sharon during the previous year seem to follow a model well defined . 
first , he admitted that " a day or two , " a palestinian state would emerge , an idea unthinkable for dyed-in-the-wool ideological hawks . 
a few months later , he scandalized his own likud party conference by stating that the occupation was unacceptable and unsustainable , another shock to those who had always talked of " liberated " rather than " occupied " territories . 
last december , he has explicitly stated that israel was geared towards a unilateral ceasefire which would lead to the " relocation " of some settlements . 
although this was still in a simple verbiage , they have still been a new language for a likud prime minister . 
sharon 's latest statements yet explicitly named the settlements to be evacuated ; the director of the national security council , general giora eiland , has been appointed president of an inter-ministerial relocation committee to draw up plans to evacuate the settlements and compensation for the settlers relocated . 
all of this has radically altered israel 's domestic political map . 
some ideological hawks in sharon 's government have threatened to resign ; shimon peres has announced that the labour party will offer sharon a parliamentary safety net ; there is also a question that the labour party to join a national unity government . 
the test , of course , is not planning , but the implementation of withdrawal , and the road is long and bumpy . 
sharon 's timing may have been guided by the problems with police investigations on its alleged corruption . 
however , anyone who would like to predict sharon 's future behavior should bear in mind that unlike begin and shamir , sharon has the military , and for him , security , and not the ideology , come first . 
his apparent pragmatism should come as no surprise . 
iraq : justice victors 
saddam hussein is dead , but all iraqis are not welcome . 
on the contrary , the way the various ethnic and religious groups have reacted to his execution is emblematic of the difficulty in maintaining cohesion of iraq . 
for the shiite majority , long brutally oppressed by saddam hussein and by all previous regimes sunni iraqis , saddam 's death symbolizes their conquest of political hegemony . 
moreover , their triumphalist rejoicing is a cruel reminder of how the oppressed , once released , can easily become oppressors in their turn . 
to the sunni minority , pushed from power by the american invasion and expresses its frustration with daily attacks against the shi 'ite population and its holy sites , saddam will remain a hero for long . 
the kurds -- who , like the shi 'a , were victimized by saddam for decades -- quietly cling to their de facto independence in doing what it takes to ensure that they will never again be subject to an arab regime . 
iraqi prime minister , nouri al-maliki , who represents the shia and kurdish coalition in power , has expressed his hope that the execution of the dictator will overcome sectarian divisions . 
but even if his words seem sincere , the reality is moving in the opposite direction , and the ugly verbal exchanges surrounding the execution even will certainly do little to forget that it was the victors " justice -- not the united states , but the shiites . 
these events do not bode well for the future of what we should get used to appoint " the former iraq . " 
in fact , the current debate in washington on the stabilisation of iraq is misplaced because we cannot stabilise something that no longer exists -- in this case , iraq as a sovereign state . 
under the guise of constitutional amendments inspired from the united states , the shiite majority has managed to arrogating near-absolute power to . 
and that is what seemed to be in washington , there are a few months ago , a successful transition to a representative government is no longer a farce : as under saddam , the authority depends on arms control . the difference now is that the government no longer has the monopoly of the violence . 
every militia , each ministry , every shia political faction , has its own weapons , goons , and death squads . for their part , the sunnis continue to use the stockpiles of weapons accumulated under saddam to conduct a rearguard action against the new order , apparently legitimized by the elections . 
with the exception of a new violent dictatorship , no authority is to bring the shiites , sunnis and kurds in one political entity . 
the idle dream of the american administration - democratizing overnight a deeply divided society accustomed to violence and coercion -- has released a terrifying array of political demons . 
in these circumstances , the ensuing debate in washington has little impact on the future of iraq , although it remains crucial to the future of power , prestige and the status of the us in the world . 
the future of iraq will be decided by the iraqis , but with bullets and not voting papers . 
the united states and the entire international community are completely unequipped to deal with the middle eastern version of yugoslavia and its regional consequences . 
and contrary to states from the break-up of yugoslavia , which could look to europe , the lack of a legitimate arab democratic model makes it even more difficult the establishment of a democratic order . 
some europeans and others can gloat over america 's failure in iraq , and the ineptness -- or worse - of their desperate policy following the occupation . 
yet the root causes of this failure go much further , to the creation of all parts of iraq in the 1920s by the authorities british imperialist , who stitched together three disparate provinces of the ottoman empire defeated in a state that has never had a coherent identity . 
that is the very foundation of iraq is based on the victors " justice : the british empire , having defeated the ottomans , has given the power to the sunni arabs in a country where they were in the minority . 
today , this arrangement comes apart in the wake of a new round of justice of the victors . 
the consequences of this re-ordering of power are not yet clear . 
but it is certain that a coherent iraqi state , that it is unified , federal , or confederal , will not emerge of a society in which one part rightly considers saddam hussein as a bloody dictator , and another part reveres him as a hero and martyr . 
wars always have unintended consequences and cruel ironies . 
in iraq , it is now apparent that some states cannot be saved without being destroyed . 
the battle of the european union for turkey 
when the plotters behind the recent suicide attacks in istanbul launched their human bombs on synagogues and british office buildings , they had different audiences in mind . 
the citizens of the european union , which turkey 's political class is eager to join the earlier represent one of these public , possibly the most important . 
the battle within the european union about the entry of turkey will take place on many fronts : in the country itself , where the government is currently undertaking major reforms to qualify for entry into the european union , to the negotiating table as soon as the december 2004 european council authorises the commission to open formal negotiations to accession to the european union and to the public in the countries already members . 
of the three fronts , the latter is the more demanding . 
most of the european union citizens are uneasy today to the idea of the entry of turkey into the eu . 
those responsible for the atrocities of istanbul may have calculated that islamic terrorism can do increase this malaise . 
by tradition , the european citizens have always accepted the new members to the door to join the club as it went from the group of six countries of origin to 25 countries that it will bring together within the european union in 2004 . 
once a purely west european community , the union has rejected its borders in all directions . 
from next year , it will stretch in northern finland to cyprus and malta in the south , from ireland in the west to the baltic states in the east . 
while the peoples have often worried that newcomers would take away their jobs and their subsidies , they have always ended up accept . 
but turkey is different . 
the 10 new countries entering the union next year , and even the balkan countries that are now being offered the possibility of future membership , are all in a traditional definition of europe . 
none of them is of a size to worry about the eu 's current balance . 
none of this is true in the case of turkey . 
apart from a narrow strip of land , its territory belongs to asia , not europe , its culture is islamic , not christian , and if it were to join the union in 2013 for example , its population will be by far the largest and most young of all the member countries of the eu . 
moreover , the turkish border with countries such as iran , iraq and syria , turkey would bring to the european union a neighbourhood disturbing : a region of the world unable to develop a regional peace on its own , an outpost of fundamentalism and terrorism islamists , a collection of fragile states full of nationalism , a field of confrontation on the militarisation , even nuclear , a region where the united states remain involved strategically and where israel will always be the point of concentration of anti-western feelings . 
turkey entering the union , the eu will be part of a troubled and troubling wider middle east , the most challenging region of the world today . 
and yet , it is precisely because of these implications that the advantages of turkey in the eu far outweigh the risks that it represents . 
above all , the possibility of membership is the most powerful force for the modernisation of turkey , and a modern turkey , democratic and prosperous is essential to europe , whether inside or outside the union . 
moreover , enter the eu a moderate type of islam for which now in turkey will be of importance to the integration of muslim minorities of european countries , already large and growing even without the input of turkey 's population . 
finally , with the opportunities that turkey with its islamic traditions , regional contacts , resources , and its geography , the eu will be in a better position to exert a stabilizing influence on a region that will affect the security of europe . 
these are powerful arguments . 
the big question is whether they are powerful enough to influence the european public sceptical . 
it would be enough of a single country on the perhaps 30 eu members in 2013 to prevent turkey 's accession . 
some countries , no doubt , will want to give the floor to a referendum that will leave the decision to the people , not just in parliament . 
even in germany , where the constitution does not allow the referendums , we call on the referendum in the case of the entry of turkey and one opposition party has already announced that it will be a central issue in next year 's election campaign for the european parliament elections . 
once the public unease towards turkey can find focus on the referendum for the country 's potential eu membership , there will be little chance that it can enter . 
at the end of the negotiations , it will become perhaps that turkey is ready for europe , but europe is not yet ready for turkey . 
that is why the battle for the entry of turkey has already begun , and the terrorists of istanbul seem to have understood this . 
those who believe that the eu will be beneficial to turkey and europe must also start in the battle to defend their ideas . 
there would be nothing worse for turkey and europe that european governments ready to welcome turkey and failing to convince their populations . 
terrorists will no doubt continue to stir up the fears of europeans timid against an islamic turkey . 
let us hope that in the end , the attacks against innocent people in the crowded streets of istanbul do not feed the fears of europeans , but rather a sense of solidarity with this dynamic country and moderate , facing a common enemy . 
the high fences are bad neighbours in europe 
good fences make good neighbours , such as the poet robert frost wrote . 
unfortunately , the european union seems to take the frost 's poetic fantasy as a serious policy prescription . 
indeed , how the european union is preparing to welcome the citizens of the 10 countries that will join in may ? 
simply shutting the door in their faces , and build of the laws of protection to force them to stay out first . 
in fact , the union is even worse . 
since there is no agreement of european level on the regulations to apply to the new eu citizens , each member country sets its own rules without any coordination . 
some of these regulations are draconian . 
austria and germany - until now the two largest recipients of immigration from eastern europe , welcoming the four fifth - announced last year that they will restrict migration from the new member states for the full transition period of seven years . 
france and belgium will restrict immigration of new citizens of the european union for the first two years of the transition period , at least . 
sweden seemed to have adopted a liberal position in a prime time , but is now postponing the opening of its borders and could reduce access immigrants to the social aid . 
the danish government almost collapsed in january when the ministry of labor proposed to open the labour market to all new eu citizens who can prove that they have found a job . 
greece and italy have remained silent until now , which probably means that they will retain the current restrictions to the new member states : they will de facto be treated the same as migrants from outside the eu . 
thus , all the countries bordering the new member states will be closed to migration from the " new europe " . 
all these dams reflect mounting public concern about the citizens of the new member states emigrating to take advantage of generous welfare systems of the union . 
little wonder , then , that the largest drops in popular support for enlargement registered by the european polls have occurred in eu countries with the most generous welfare . 
but support for enlargement is fading everywhere , on the threshold of the entry of new countries . 
at the same time , closing the door to the union 's newest citizens will not solve the problem of access to social services and will certainly hurt economic growth . 
on the labour markets of the european union , which are characterised by their low mobility , such as those that exist in western europe and southern europe , migrants can play a very important role . 
by increasing average productivity , they contribute not only to strengthen growth , but also to achieve higher incomes per capita . 
in fact , the fact distortions in the definition of wages -souvent set without any real correspondence with the rate of labor productivity locale- workers even contribute to reduce the rate of unemployment in western and southern europe . 
in addition , shutting the door will not solve the issue of access to social aid since illegal migration is worse than legal migration : it exploits the available resources without contributing anything in return for social aid even if most of the immigrants are young and work . 
the best way to deal with the fear of immigration as a source of abuse for the social systems would be to adopt a common and rather generous transitional quota at the level of the european union as a whole , and then remove them quickly if they are not met . 
migration quotas are preferable to other types of restrictions because they allow at least a part of the potential benefits in terms of social support from immigration should be made . 
quotas could be determined according to the historical periods of high migration - according to , for example , an annual flow of 400 000 people for the whole of the european union . 
while these transitional restrictions are put in place , reforms should be taken to respond to the questions that underpin the public 's fear of immigration . 
the root of this fear , of course , is the vast differences in income between the citizens of lithuania , for example , and those of most of the countries of the union . 
of course , economic convergence is a long-term business . 
thus , the redistributive policies of the european union should be reformed to discourage the citizens of the poorest member states do ways of social support . 
here the problem is the incompatibility of social insurance , where the aid that we receive are based on the contributions , and on the other hand , social assistance programs that involve cash transfers . 
all the countries of the european union and the new members must be encouraged to adapt their social assistance programmes ( which are also present in the new member states ) , so as to meet some basic requirements . 
a coordination of these guaranteed minimum income to the scale of the european union must gradually put in place with the long-term intention , put in place a safety net valid throughout the european union and forming one of its institutional pillars . 
the challenges of calder√≥n 
mexico has finally found a new president last friday , in the circumstances of bad omen . 
felipe calder√≥n was sworn , braving the anger of his left-wing opposition , and showing more clever the partido de la revoluci√≥n democr√°tica ( prd ) and its leader , andr√©s manuel l√≥pez obrador , but without paying a high price . 
all emissions of information television and one of the world have displayed the same headline : " the new mexican president comes to power in the chaos and violence . " 
mexico 's institutions narrowly have withstood the onslaught of a left-wing opposition insurgent virtually , bent in vain to prevent calder√≥n 's inauguration , and the bitterness of a partido revolucionario institucional ( pri ) , increasingly decided to leave calder√≥n to take power , before fail miserably . 
calder√≥n impressively overcame apparently insurmountable obstacles on the way to the presidency , the fight to govern and transform mexico does , however , that begin . 
most journalists mexicans believe that it should be relatively easy for calder√≥n to do better than the largely self-inflicted failure of the outgoing president vicente fox . 
mexico needs to grow about two times faster than it did under fox ( a small 2 % per year ) . 
if calder√≥n can strengthen law and order and use his considerable political skills to reach an agreement with the pri on structural economic reforms , he will succeed . 
but it is simplistic . 
the mandate of fox , as well as the last four years of the president ernesto zedillo , have not really been a failure . 
mexico had not experienced economic stability , low inflation , low interest rates , a stable currency and steady growth , although mediocre , ten years in a row since the 1960s . 
for the first time , mortgages , car loans and consumer credit became available to the lower middle class : this year , it has built and sold more houses and bought more cars than ever before . 
similarly , although fox can be criticized for not having done silence the protesters and a disruptive , extremist opposition , it has never resorted to the bloody crackdown , which has made famous most of its predecessors . 
in addition , he has ripped the mexico to its archaic cocoon in terms of foreign affairs and placed immigration and human rights at the heart of mexico 's new international agenda . 
calder√≥n is not to negotiate with the pri is an easy task , and it fails to build a coalition government , that it believes to be the solution to the deadlock in mexico to a standstill since 1997 . 
whatever the advantages of a cabinet comprising only members of his partido acci√≥n nacional ( pan ) , this is not what calder√≥n sought . 
similarly , it proved impossible to reach any agreement with the opposition in what was the inauguration ceremony , chaotic , depressing scenes of congressmen to fight in the house , while calder√≥n was ushered through a back door for a ceremony shipped in haste . 
mexico 's economic problems could prove them as more intractable than many commentators seem to believe . 
mexico has experienced an economic opening under former president carlos salinas in 1988-1994 ; a belated but successful political opening under president zedillo in 1994-2000 ; and , finally , a true rotation of powers thanks to fox . 
but the foundations of the old pri-corporativist system created in the 1930s remained intact and represent the obstacles the most impressive and most formidable to mexico 's growth and success . 
the first pillar of this system is the public and private economic monopolies that dominate the country . 
the oil companies ( pemex ) and electric power ( federal elecricidad ) managed by the state have no competitors . 
the private virtual monopolies in telecommunications ( telmex ) , television ( televisa ) , cement ( cemex ) , the manufacture of bread and tortilla ( bimbo and maseca , respectively ) and the bank ( banamex / citigroup and bancomer / banco de bilbao ) may face competition abroad , but not at the national level . 
these monopolies are stronger than ever , and prices , supplies , service and quality all suffer . 
the second pillar is formed by the unions who control the mexican labor movement since the 1930s . 
they enjoy prerogatives hiring and firing prerogatives workers , elect the leaders by acclamation , mandatory dues without transparency and immense political power . 
the teachers union is the largest in latin america , the union of oil workers is the richest and the social security employees defeat any attempt to pension or health reform for years . 
the third pillar of the system is political monopoly . 
for 70 years , the pri has totally controlled mexican politics ; now they are three parties to do , and no one else can enter the political arena or have access to the enormous public subsidies -- more than $ 500 million last year -- without their consent . 
the main parties write their own anti-trust legislation , vote their own subsidies , and choose their own elected . 
the absence of consecutive re-election at whatever level strengthens the party machines " power : they are the choice of candidates , that the voters are only ratify at the polls . 
so mexico 's challenges boil down to release the movement of workers , break the private monopolies and opening the public monopolies to competition , and to reduce barriers to entry restricting access to the political arena . 
this may not be sufficient conditions for success , but they are certainly necessary . 
calder√≥n must strengthen his presidency from the beginning . 
take possession of power is perhaps the only way to achieve this , even if it may seem risky . 
elected with only 35 % of the vote , without a majority in congress , and with a seizure of power on the eve of an economic slowdown in the united states , things are difficult anyway . 
given that roughly a third of the electorate think he won fairly , and given the precariousness of the rule of law in the country , calder√≥n 's position is even less enviable . 
the caution and patience will in any event would probably not his best advisors . 
the challenge of mr ch√°vez 
the recent parliamentary elections held in venezuela have confirmed the trend that has brought the country to the headlines in recent years . 
president hugo ch√°vez has demonstrated once again that he enjoys broad support among the nation 's poor and desperate , and he has a good measure ahead of his opposition in terms of political skill , cunning and ruthlessness . 
yet , at the same time voter turnout is declining as each new election organised under the mandate of mr ch√°vez and regularity dubious elections have become increasingly visible . 
it is certain that the withdrawal of the opposition to a few days of the election represented rather , as the proclaimed mr ch√°vez , a symptom of its own weakness rather than problems of electoral process . 
and it is almost certain that the same weakness is part of the gradual stifling of some aspects of the traditional venezuelan democracy . 
even so , the mistakes of the opposition have been very important , ranging from support for the failed coup against mr ch√°vez , democratically elected , in april 2002 to the failed strike at pedevsa , venezuela 's national oil company , at the beginning of 2003 . 
nothing is more dangerous in policy that failure in direct confrontation . 
in such circumstances , mr ch√°vez can afford to be bold , despite its political failures when it comes to act in favour of its electoral base : the 50 % or more of venezuelans who live in poverty and despair . 
poverty has increased since mr ch√°vez came to power in 1998 : the state budget and trade balances are even more at the mercy of oil revenues today that this was the case in the past , and , apart from cuban literacy programs and services of proximity " doctors to barefoot , " the whole of the public health of poor people has stagnated , not to say worse . 
it is likely that the future will not bring any major change . 
ch√°vez will modify a large part of the constitution at will and parachute en masse his men in the judicial system and the electoral authorities . 
it will continue to distribute oil-based subsidies in the well-worn venezuelan tradition of marcos p√©rez jim√©nez and carlos andr√©s p√©rez . 
this fact , ch√°vez will get elected again next year and could well remain in power until the end of the next decade . 
yet , if this is what the venezuelan people want , so be it . 
it is , after all , their business who governs them , and how , while human rights are not systematically violated or the democratic institutions suspended indefinitely , and that the international standards of conduct of affairs are respected . 
according to this last point , at least , mr ch√°vez has perhaps been further that it is allowed . 
for years , he has been accused of having taken the baton of fidel castro by supporting a radical rhetoric and anti-imperialist revolutionary , not to say , throughout latin america . 
perhaps it is time now for the latin american nations and the international community to take these charges seriously . 
mr ch√°vez distributes oil to caribbean island nations and cuba and repurchased argentine debt to support the policy of president nestor kirchner . 
in mar del plata , argentina , last month , he openly participated in a rally against the free trade area of the americas ( ftaa ) , in the company of , among others , evo morales , the bolivian leader of coca growers , which could well become the next president of bolivia . 
similarly , mr ch√°vez openly supports daniel ortega , the perennial sandinista candidate in the presidential election and shafick handal , another perennial fmln candidate in el salvador . 
his former ambassador to mexico has openly participated with vehemence to some evenings of presidential campaign from the mayor of mexico city , mr andr√©s manuel lopez obrador . 
it seems that the foreign policy of ch√°vez a main theme : the provocation of a major confrontation with the united states . 
the danger , of course , that when this confrontation will happen if it happens , that over bolivia , the ftaa , human rights and freedom of the press , it will be too late for the master . 
the challenge is to prevent the confrontation that ch√°vez clearly wants . 
unfortunately , the government of george bush has never been very adept at conflict prevention . 
the hemisphere 's other nations have a direct interest to prevent a fight that would force them to take party and could even threaten their economic interests and national security . 
although many of ch√°vez 's positions have received some support from a few latin american nations , the division that it has created in latin america , castro 's cuba , between left and right , free-traders and " bolivarians , " between pro- and anti-american , is mainly artificial but certainly not impossible to overcome . 
certainly , many latin american leaders have tried to assuage and control mr ch√°vez , without result . 
it could be very expensive not to try . 
the last time that revolutionaries are opposed to the united states , in central america in the 1980s , everyone lost . 
new divisions in the hemisphere , created by a leader awash in oil income , would prove far more disastrous . 
should we reaffirm the positive discrimination ? 
equal rights for all citizens is a fundamental principle of the next liberal . 
such rights offer the opportunity to participate in political life , to create associations , and to speak freely . 
they also open doors to economic participation and participation in social institutions such as education . 
constitutional guarantees of these rights are a spectacular success in the long battle for citizenship that marked the last two centuries . 
however , such legal guarantees of these rights are often inadequate . 
and even the right to vote has little meaning for someone who is totally dependent on other people or institutions . 
equality before the law remains an empty promise sense for those who cannot afford to use it , or simply do not know how to use it . 
the civil right to education to the extent of the intellectual capacities of everyone must be encouraged in many ways . 
thus , one of the great issues of social progress in the last century was to breathe life into the abstract concept of equal rights for the creation of a social content . 
this meant actively encourage these actions by the information and education policy , for example . 
with regard to the world of education , it often meant committing resources of financial aid to students , such as subsidized loans or scholarships . 
yet , despite these achievements , some stubborn obstacles to the equal participation of all . 
the major groups remained underrepresented in the social circles most successful citizens . 
this was particularly the case in women and some cultural minorities , especially in cases where these minorities were characteristics , such as skin color . 
few leaders , ministers , teachers , doctors , and lawyers were found in the populations of these groups , so that the questions about the invisible barriers which prevented these minorities to gain access to such posts . 
the entrenched institutional cultures may have campaigned against women or black people . 
want a full citizenship for all meant that it was necessary to achieve more than the legal safeguards , the dissemination of information and even the financial aid offered . 
this was a brave step , carried out by the us in mind , that to decide for a time at least that new policies were necessary to remedy these injustices installed for a long time . affirmative action , or positive discrimination as it was called , was to put in place a set of regulations that used a percentage of representation among the political candidates , students and teachers , the police and the armed forces , and in any other group , for the people belonging to those minorities at a disadvantage . 
the us supreme court became the guardian of the positive discrimination . 
wherever it was seriously establishment , positive discrimination was undoubtedly a success . 
this is particularly the case in the country who previously had a homogeneous and must now take into account the black citizens or muslim or identifiable as belonging to a minority identifiable and neglected . 
and , it is at the same time as other countries went to the us for a policy model that discrimination policy was questioned by means of the three key issues . 
first , it runs the risk of inverted injustice by which the traditionally favoured found themselves deprived ? 
the us supreme court had to answer this question when elel traita for the first time the case of a white student who was refused admission medical school despite its academic results superior to those of other candidates . 
in britain , children in private schools must now fear to be at a disadvantage because of the pressure on universities to admit more students from state schools . 
that brings us back to the old and vexing question whether we can be equal and excellent ? 
then , equal representation at all levels really what all groups want or need ? 
after all , the " feminization " of the teaching profession in many countries had no adverse effects . 
many countries have benefited from the entrepreneurialism of their chinese or jewish minorities . 
are we not to pursuing too mechanical ideals where the lack of privileges and the obstacles are confused with the lack of diversity ? 
finally , the positive discrimination in some cases producing a new form of rigid segmentation that destroys the genuine civil society that it seeks to put in place ? 
are women , for example , always the best defenders for the defence of the interests of women ? 
the same question arises for members of religious groups and ethnic minorities , and even certain social classes . 
shake it to the idea of parliaments where the main criterion for admission would be belonging to a group in need of affirmative action . 
indeed , in some countries , democracy fails to implement imaginative and effective governance because the main objective seems to be to take into account all the major groups . 
to use an earlier point : affirmative action has always been and still is a courageous final step in the fight for civil rights universal , not just on paper , but in reality . 
however , the positive discrimination must not become an enduring principle of the next liberal . 
if there is a set of rules needs a " sunset clause " to put in place the study after a specific and limited period , it is the positive discrimination . 
the flexibility of the us supreme court in this area is exemplary . 
elsewhere , it is probably best to introduce in local legislation a sell-by clause for positive discrimination after a period of five or ten years at most . 
such a clause could be renewed , but there is nothing more effective as a firm deadline to force a careful examination and the concentration of thoughts . 
the nation-state revisited 
now it is fashionable to claim that the nation state has lost its place . 
globalisation , it is said , means that nations can no longer control their own affairs . 
they must unite to others , as in the case of the european union , asean or mercosur , and increasingly rely on international institutions like the united nations , the world bank and the world trade organisation . 
such a view is risky . 
indeed , when you look closely , it is suspect , or simply wrong . 
the nation state , with its strengths and weaknesses , is alive and well . 
to begin with its strengths , the nation-state remains the only political space which manages to the constitution of freedom . 
the democratic credentials of organizations like the eu are dubious , and entirely absent in the case of the united nations and other global institutions . 
moreover , despite the frequent search of new identities , european , latin american or other , and despite many references to a new cosmopolitanism , or even a " world civil society , " most people feel at home in their own country , the nation state of which they are citizens . 
migration is generally led to other countries . 
many countries are currently debating the integration of migrants . 
what does it take to be british , german or american ? 
such debates on immigration make sense that if we recognize that citizenship is defined by and for the nations . 
this is , for most people , the positive side of the nation-state . 
the nation state has been for more than two centuries , and continues to be the reference of belonging and civic involvement for most of human beings . 
this is the context in which we see our freedoms protected or destroyed . 
the countries released of communism in 1989 have certainly felt that restore national sovereignty and recovering freedom were closely linked . 
yet there is , and always has been , another , uglier face of the nation-state : nationalism . 
the nationalist impulse can be aggressive or defensive , directed against the other or inward-looking . 
in both cases , it corrupts any attempt to create an international community of open societies . 
this was the problem in iraq : a nation state had become a troublemaker in the region and beyond . 
more recently , a less violent but equally worrying phenomenon has gained ground , the revival of national protectionism . 
the doha round of trade negotiations is stalled because developed countries refuse to open their markets to cheaper products from developing countries , which in turn are trying to protect their industries . 
many would prefer privileged relationships to open trade . 
in this area , the eu has often been helpful either . 
but today , the nationalist virus has infected the european union . 
france , spain and poland have tried to keep major industries firmly in " national hands . " 
suddenly , the single european market is forgotten , and a return to fragmented markets is taking root . 
consider , for example , the " directives on services " of the european commission . 
although freedom of movement for workers is one of the " four freedoms " of the single market , many eu countries are trying to protect their domestic labor markets by suspending this freedom as long as possible . 
germany , in particular , argues that the high unemployment resulting from the reunification in 1990 requires it to close its labour market for the new member states . 
such trends are dangerous . 
historically , protectionism has often led to economic conflict , which can quickly turn into more serious clashes . 
the signs are not good , even in europe . 
a recent summit of eu leaders to subject the energy policy -- area where cooperation is not only very desirable , but necessary . 
yet even german chancellor angela merkel , clearly pro-european , went to the meeting with the explicit intention to put a brake on the creation of other european powers in this area . 
the russian-german agreement to build a gas pipeline bypassing poland and lithuania , with the former chancellor gerhard schr√∂der leading , has already contributed to the deterioration of relations between poland and germany , to say nothing of european cooperation . 
for a time , the pendulum of public opinion may have swung too far to the nation state and its role . 
this is one of the reasons why so many people have felt estranged from their political leaders . 
but it would be unfortunate , and even dangerous , that the pendulum back towards nationalism to the old . 
nation states are welcome , they are important elements of a liberal world order . 
but they must be open to cooperation and coordination with the others . 
we need to resist the birth of a trend that recalls the events of the early years of the 20th century , trend that was to lead to a global disaster . 
gordon brown qualify ? 
gordon brown obviously wants to succeed tony blair as british prime minister . 
but it is less obvious that he is ready to do what is necessary to lead the labour party to victory at the next general election . 
indeed , he must repudiate the legacy of blair , which , at a minimum , means promising to take britain out of the war in iraq . 
brown covets the office of prime minister since may 12 , 1994 , fateful day when john smith , the leader of the labour party in opposition , died of a heart attack . 
two weeks later , on may 31 , blair and brown met in a small restaurant in north london and debated who should take over the party leadership . 
at the end of their discussion , they have made a double agreement : brown would remain on the sidelines and support blair , who engaged in return to cede the place later . 
the fact that they have not agreed on the time or the circumstances of the handover of power was also inevitable that decisive . 
inevitably , they could not foresee that blair was going to win three successive election victories , in 1997 , 2001 and 2005 , done without precedent for their party , and thus keep labour in power for a record-breaking period without doubt last 13 years . 
the key challenge for new labour ( according to the blair re-styled it with his characteristic gift for manipulation ) was the management of the british economy . 
since the second world war , most british governments tried to manipulate the economy to promote their party in the short term , reaping generally disastrous results in the long term . 
this lamentable tradition was common to the conservatives and labour , and yet , as unfair as it sounds , it is the labour party that was most tainted by a reputation for inability to economic management . 
brown decisively changed that reputation . 
he has probably been the minister for the economy the most remarkable of british history , which is not to be put on the account of the inspiration or genius , but simply on the fact that it has created a new tradition giving priority to moderate inflation , interest rates low and stable government finances . 
brown has understood that these priorities were essential , not just for the british economy , but also for the long-term objectives of labour in power ; and it has promoted this programme by giving the bank of england independent responsibility for keeping inflation low . 
the result has been that britain has had an unprecedented decade marked by low inflation and relatively high economic growth , outperforming many of its european counterparts . 
yet , in spite of the economic success , it became increasingly clear that blair was finished . 
the voters have increasingly disillusioned with the inevitable flaws in a government too familiar , and the party has been increasingly unhappy with a leader who overdoes his hospitality . 
initially , blair thought that he could claim the right to stay in power for a third term of five years . 
but the pressure on him to go has steadily risen , to the point that it has almost promised to go in the summer of 2007 . 
no one knows exactly when , or how , blair will give the place . 
if a formal competition for the party leadership is organised , it seems likely that several candidates will put on the ranks . 
that said , almost all authoritative observers seem to agree that brown is by far the most likely to become the next labour prime minister . 
that is the easy part . 
from there , no one seems to have the certainty that brown knows what to do , or has the capacity to fight and win new parliamentary elections for the labour party . 
its reputation for command and control of the economy is magisterial and unchallenged , but he has not given almost no clue as to what he thinks of other government policies . 
it remained cold and almost silent , visibly forward to get his legacy , but has given no hint of what would change if there were . 
if there is one thing that it cannot promise , it is to continue the policy of blair . 
if brown chooses the continuity , he will lose . 
after ten years of blair , he must offer one or several policies that mark a clear break . 
the choice of the most obvious change of policy on iraq : if brown wants to win an election as labour leader , he must renounce blair 's policy and announce the rapid withdrawal of british troops . 
in tactical terms , this should be easy and obvious : whatever the deceitful and illegal reasons initially data as a pretext to invade iraq , everyone now knows that this war has been a political disaster , strategic and moral . 
everyone knows that it cannot be " won , " if that means something , and brown knows that both the war and britain 's servile subordination to the bush administration are deeply unpopular in the country . 
that is the problem that it is the most urgent need to address : but for the moment , none of the main political parties has dared touch it . 
over the past three weeks , labour , liberal democrats and the conservatives have all held their annual conference . 
all have focused on national policies , none has dared to discuss iraq , because they all know that it would raise the issue of the withdrawal , which in turn would provoke a major and possibly explosive debate on relations between britain and the united states . 
brown the stomach to confront the issue of iraq ? 
probably not . 
it may very well decide that it is too difficult , in which case he will be an interim prime minister , condemned to serve out the last three of the mandate of labour without any hope of winning the next election . 
this is not what he had planned in passing its market with blair in 1994 . 
the latest innovations in economics 
the great depression brought john maynard keynes on the front of the stage of economic thought . 
according to keynes , private investment is inherently unstable because of the modes and fashions among investors , the fact of the changes in the " animal spirits " of businessmen or because falling prices disrupt the financial system . 
keynesians thought that prudent monetary policy ( central banks raising or lowering interest rates to diminish the fluctuations of private investment ) could participate in the stabilisation of the economy . 
but they also believed that the government would agree to be directly involved , with expansive fiscal policy , to maintain the overall level of spending in a stable economy . 
such a policy , they believed , would forever banish the spectre of mass unemployment on a large scale , as was the case during the great depression . 
moreover , it could also possibly guarantee full employment effectively . 
they expected near-full employment raised the threat of inflation . 
after all , why the workers and unions moderate wage demands if governments support spending whenever high unemployment looms ? 
a restriction important high wage demands ( the fear of being made redundant when unemployment rises ) was gone . 
what would replace it ? 
for the first post-war generation , the predominant answer was that corporatist social democracy would replace . 
unions would bow to the demands of the government to moderate their demands for wage increases , and governments would bow to the demands of the unions on public spending and social benefits . 
the keynesian assures us that the great depression cannot happen again . 
but its solution to the problem of creeping inflation was not the road and utterly collapsed in the 1970s . 
following the first inflationary crisis of the 1970s in the main industrialised countries , the predominant economic thinking in these countries turned to the ways " semi-mon√©taristes . " 
the victory of milton friedman has never been as comprehensive as the keynesians " . 
however , in the mid-1980s , politicians of the whole world agreed on the following points . 
central banks must engage in a credible way on price stability in the long term . 
central banks must accept that the average rate of unemployment is determined not by cyclical factors " but by structural factors that they should not try to solve . 
announcing and trying to maintain a target of monetary growth is an easy way for the central bank to communicate its principal intentions , gain credibility and give outsiders a way to check whether sound policies are followed . 
monetarism was the mirror image of keynesianism . 
it seemed to ensure that inflation of the 1970s could never happen again . 
but it offered no solution to the problem of structural unemployment that arose in western europe . 
over the last 15 years have shown that monetarism is ill-equipped to deal with the challenges of falling prices in the context of highly-leveraged firms and banks as the keynesian solution was not made to deal with the challenges of inflation . 
in the 1970s and 1980s , some people , including myself , were the bankruptcy of the social democrats systems to control inflation on the account bad decisions . 
politicians did not understand that the increase of social benefits was the inevitable price for the reduction of wages , while union leaders had not understood that if corporatist social democracy did not restrain inflation , political power would shift to the right and rising unemployment would be used to the limit . 
today , it is still on the other bad decisions current alarming economic conditions at the heart of the industrialised world ( more than a decade of stagnation in japan , deflation also present in germany , recession ) . 
japanese and european central bankers have not dropped their interest rates or enough early enough : the regulators of the banking sector are diverted from the caprices of speculative lending , and politicians have refused to extend fiscal policy sufficiently . 
but politicians and central bank governors cannot always be seen as able to take the right decisions . the right policies must be designed to function , despite the lack of vision and good advice of the leaders . 
the inflation of the 1970s was a natural failure of keynesian political economy . 
deflation that threatens japan , europe , and perhaps even the united states of a long period of large gaps between potential and actual output is a natural failure of the semi-monetarist orthodoxy that has dominated the macroeconomic policies at the heart of the industrialised world since the early 1980s . 
we are going around in circles . 
without form a circle : no government would allow a repeat of the liquidity collapse as it occurred in the 1930s or the failure of banks and companies on a scale to put the entire financial system at risk . 
it is an upward spiral . 
the world 's macroeconomic problems are real , but they will not lead to another great depression , in large part because politicians remember this first great depression . 
we need a new revolution of economic policies to the keynesian and semi-monetarist ones , a revolution that will not ( wholly ) lose sight of the successes of the previous revolutions , but will eliminate their intrinsic failings . 
where could well come the revolution ? 
perhaps of ben bernanke , the new governor of the federal reserve , whose long career has always concerned about the asset prices , the role of the adverse selection in the credit market and the need for central banks in a difficult situation not only the current operations in the short term on the markets open . 
he believes that banks should try to pave the way long-term investments in action . 
bernankeism , anyone ? 
the fate of humanity / the hopes of humanity 
for some time now , and certainly since the terrorist attacks against the united states on september 11 , 2001 , as in the past when we watched the slaughters in kosovo , sarajevo , srebrenica , rwanda and congo on our televisions , the new cannot talk that war or threats of war , of violent deaths or threats of violent deaths . 
everywhere in the world , we are keenly aware of the power of our weapons . 
missiles to nuclear warhead until the trucks full of fertilizer or explosives brought to the belts , we have used our technology to develop greatly the dark side of our nature of biological species violent , the role of predator . 
i certainly have no intention to minimize or reject this aspect of humanity 's history and current events . 
i do not want anyone to forget that more than half of the previous century happened for some to kill by bullets , gassed , stabbed , burn or starve a tenth of men alive on this planet , that it is because of the first world war and famine that followed the great leap forward mao . 
however , it is not a complete inventory of . 
in fact , the human abattoirs of the twentieth century - as well as the slaughterhouses that preparing various communities as of today - may not appear in the future as the most important part of our experience and our human condition , and of what our descendants will regard as their history . 
for them , the most important features of our experience may be : 
¬∑ 
¬∑ 
in all , the twentieth century remains the witness many regions of the world remained desperately poor due to one or several reasons : ( 1 ) a criminal governance ; ( 2 ) a lack of machinery useful and productive in a global economy , out of subsistence agriculture and industry under-qualified labour services ; ( 3 ) a non-existent public education system , which could make the public education and the know-how to the use of these machines ; ( 4 ) the barriers ( legal and physical ) to prevent the populations , where demand is low , to sell the product of their work where demand is high . 
however , towards the end of the twentieth century , these four reasons for the origin of the poor have generally been reduced . 
the governments such as kim jong il in north korea are very few of our days . 
almost all the countries of the world are no more than a generation of near-universal literacy . 
the speed of technological progress has created a cornucopia of invention and innovation that is open to all regions that can send a student get a degree in engineering . 
and above all , the barriers to making goods to mauritius , mozambique , or in mauritania are sold in new york or berlin and santiago or tokyo fall quickly . 
the huge container ships that first appeared on the seas recently have revolutionised the global trade in a generation . 
the new information technologies used in the management of means of transport and distribution will probably have the same impact . 
in addition , the advent of the internet and technology the fiber-optic cable industry will do as much of the did the introduction of vessels to steam iron hull hundred and fifty years earlier for the international trade of agricultural and industrial goods . 
it will certainly take a generation for these changes are being felt around the world . 
yet , at the heart of the industrialised world of rich countries , there is already concern about these revolutions that loom on the horizon . 
in fact , these concerns will only become aiguiseront as the fears of citizens of these rich countries when the barriers to international trade fall and that the redistribution of wealth , the social order and the political world of the industrialised world will be shaken to their foundations . 
for the whole world , however , the next two generations are those who will bring an extraordinary opportunities for economic growth and prosperity international . 
there may even be a pot at the end of the story , after all . 
the defeat of argentine n√©oliberalisme 
in the 1990s , argentina mit in place policies which were to nearly 80 % of the neo-liberal programme . 
it opened up its economy to trade and international capital ; it sought to ensure low inflation and a stable currency . 
it strove to improve its legal system so that its decisions are in agreement with the international laws to generate some confidence when the respect of contract law , with or without bribes . 
this has not market . 
for all that , nobody can say that the 1990s were catastrophic , despite their consequences which led to the terrible summer of 2002 . 
life was much more difficult during the dirty war of the 1970s , when an army of all honour threw women out of helicopters in the south atlantic , and urban guerrillas shot people because ... because ... well , just because ! 
the 1980s were hardly better . 
starting with a debt crisis at its height caused by a massive rise in the us interest rates and the value of the dollar , the decade ended hyperinflation , which caused a decline in a decade to argentina , lagging behind the world 's leading economies . 
during the 1990s , by contrast , argentina 's gdp per capita increased by 25 % , with ups and downs , only to lose all of that gain of growth over the last four years . 
until the end of last winter , the problems of argentina seemed to be little more than an unpleasant but temporary bump , just as the crisis of the 1994-1995 mexican " tequila " or even the crises in east asia in the years 1997-1998 proved to be only temporary interruptions , and not watersheds . 
such optimism is impossible to our days , and there is little hope that the recent stock market crash of this country is only temporary . 
the opinion of the institutions , such as us treasury undersecretary at the economy , john taylor , is that argentina 's collapse is the fault of its political class . 
i do not share this view . 
argentine leaders were repeatedly warned that maintaining a constant exchange rate and the annexation of the peso to the dollar risked sending the economy into recession if the value of the dollar increases . 
argentine politicians were also warned that their peso policy could not be sustained without the ratio of national debt and gdp falls . 
yet during the years of economic boom , from 1993 to 1998 , the public spending outran taxes enough to get the debt / gdp ratio of 29 to 44 % . 
when the dollar is mounted and recession came , politicians of little statesmanship to balance the state budget in time have not shown enough courage to balance the budget when the situation is hardening . 
the coup de gr√¢ce was delivered by the government 's decision ( in the midst of a crisis ) to maintain bank deposits fixed in dollar and put the debt owed to banks in pesos , thereby bankrupting the financial system of the nation of the stroke of a pen . 
the position of the ruling class is simple : if any of these three disastrous policies had not been taken , argentina would not be entry into crisis , or at worst it would have suffered a mini crisis of type mexican . 
the neo-liberal programme of argentina in the 1990s was to any test , according to this view , but argentine politicians breathed the image of a large community of clever idiots . 
there is , however , another way to see the argentine tragedy . 
if you consider that the country 's political system has long been a predictable way , consistently producing governments that promise more than they can deliver . 
they promise rich oligarchs not to levy taxes too high . 
that promise to workers and consumers generous social insurance . 
they promise rapid economic development , generous infrastructure spending , jobs little binding and pleasant for those who have political relations , etc . 
overall , these promises mean that any view on the national product always exceed 100 % of the total . 
popular demands that the government fulfills all of them can never be satisfied . 
add to this an unfair distribution of wealth and income , the lack of social commitment between the middle class and the working class and a long tradition of political violence , and you have the perfect cocktail of a policy where all oppose all . 
the battle fundamental policy of the distribution of wealth in argentina remain to be resolved . 
any political force which will try to manipulate the auction by promising only what it can do is doomed to defeat . 
thus , in argentina , the big budget deficits are a law of nature , a fact of life . 
this fact , argentine interest rates can be low and affordable only on rare , short periods of time . 
everyone knows that argentina 's political system generates a chronic deficit , and we know that this does that indicate that the interest payments on the debt were sentenced to explode . 
the fact the complete lack of stability of debt dynamics argentina , the indexing of the exchange rate on a strong currency could not last . 
free access to international capital markets and bank accounts by dollar meant that when the indexing of exchange rate changes would come into conflict with this logic of argentine politics producer of deficit , the result could be catastrophic . 
if the current crisis had been finessed if argentina another decade of rapid growth , the conflicts born of the redistribution of wealth would have been moderates . 
after all , europe before the second world war the nastiest policies in the world : rioting right-wing mobs in france , general strikes in britain through the civil war in spain and fascism in italy , not to mention the aggressive consolidation of power in germany by nazism . 
and yet , western europe 's postwar encountered no problem of public order that could not be resolved in maintaining the strong currency and growth . 
i do not share this view , too . 
yes , the argentine government made huge mistakes , its politicians sinned against the gods of monetary economics . 
but the punishment need to be so deep and so severe ? 
the false promises of private pensions 
one of the strangest claims made in the debates on social insurance who come today confuse the richest countries in the world , is that pension schemes funded by governments and whose benefits are fixed ( such as america 's social security system ) are outmoded . 
these programs were fine , according to this argument , at the time of the great depression and the post-world war ii generation , when the economy was based on the industry , but they have become obsolete in the economy high-tech , networked , post-industrial today . 
advocates of this argument are proposing a different model . 
companies accept today to support the pensions of employees contributing to their private savings and current governments should offer ( or require ) contribute to this private savings . 
the value of these accounts varies according to the market and is not based on a defined-benefit scheme that guarantees a fixed real sum of resources available at the time of retirement . 
this argument is strange because it takes the economic situation to backward . 
when many companies offer their employees defined-benefit pensions in the long term , the government has no interest to put in place a parallel defined-benefit scheme and to ask employees to participate . 
after all , in such a context , employees who attach a defined-benefit pension can go to work for companies that provide such systems . 
the main advantages of a system where the government requires that workers also participate in a national social security system are accrue to those employees who really should attach great importance to the defined-benefit schemes without actually being able to determine their true preferences . 
they are also combined for employees who do not have the ability to negotiate to encourage their boss to offer the pensions that they want to achieve and that they really need . 
there are few companies today ready to offer defined-benefit pension schemes in the long term . 
one of the reasons is the fact that companies today are much more aware of their own long-term fragility than they were in the years following the second world war . 
even ibm , the united states , which prides itself on its stability , do not want to take the risk of offering a defined-benefit schemes . 
the risk that defined-benefit pensions usually compensated by two benefits for companies that offered these systems . 
first of all , the fact that leaving the company usually meant cashing in one 's pension with a discount increased the fidelity of employees . 
then , complaisant accountants " optimistic assumptions about the benefits of pension reserves , associated with the ability of corporations to take bigger risks , brightened the financial picture that companies could present to their investors . 
today , the risks are perceived as much greater , and the benefits as well as lower . 
this fact , employers are offering of systems that look closely or far defined-benefit pensions . 
this decrease in defined-benefit programs in all the rich countries of the world economy is not a good thing , because the configuration of the prices of goods suggest that young and middle-aged workers attach great importance to the defined-benefit programs . 
historically , the gap between expected returns on low-risk assets such as treasury bills or the good investment and high-risk assets such as stocks and real estate was generally very big . 
in short , as some economists , including harvard 's robert barro and mathematicians like benoit mandelbrot argue , this could be due to the fact that the risky investments are actually much more risky than the suggest the theories and the mathematics of financial technical standard . 
in my opinion , at least , this is partly because the memory of the 1930s and 2000 , when the stock market has suffered greatly , occupies too large a place in the minds of investors . 
employees and other asset holders place a high value on the security and predictability , also a defined-benefit pension is very valuable . 
but in today 's world , only national governments are large enough to implement such systems and ensure that pensions will genuinely be available when workers retire . 
i am enough social democrat to believe that if there is an economic service or a benefit that citizens attach great importance and that only the government can offer , then it is its duty to provide it . 
we economists know that there are many drawbacks to push the government out of its basic role to provide real public services such as defence , security and justice , while offering citizens with incentives to offset the effects of true market failures . 
where the private market has the flexibility of two hands , government bureaucracy has at best two thumbs . 
but the collection of payroll taxes from tens of millions of workers and the writing of tens of millions of pension checks is part of the routine , semi-automatic task that the government can do well . 
at a time when private companies backing away from defined-benefit programs , it is even more important and valuable as the government is doing , while our post-industrial society between in the era of the networks , that it was in the past . 
islamist movements and the democratic paradox 
the wave of anger across the arab world after the publication in denmark , a few months ago , of cartoons depicting the prophet muhammad , the victory of hamas in palestine and the increasing radicalization of the iranian regime are " political islam " a fundamental problem on the international stage . 
but there can be no a single answer all the questions that arise . 
we need to abandon the idea that there is a monolithic islamist movement . 
political islam has different forms that have emerged as the main alternative to secular arab nationalist regimes whose legitimacy , based on the national liberation struggle , has disappeared due to their inability to solve the economic and social problems , establish the rule of law , and ensure the freedoms . 
in palestine , for example , the islamists have prevailed on fatah because of years of bad governance under the harsh conditions spawned by israeli occupation . 
for a long time , america and europe share an atavistic fear of the " islamic alternative " to the leaders secular nationalists like those of fatah and defend the status quo . 
but monarchs and secular dictators of the arab world have crushed any opposition , mosques , the only place in the shelter which the political commitment was possible . 
today , political islam can no longer be content , because we cannot build democracy in driving underground parties that have a strong social basis . this is what has tragically demonstrated in algeria 15 years ago . 
the only alternative to authoritarianism is to achieve a transition that allows islamists to participate in political life , while encouraging them to accept unequivocally the democratic rules of the game . 
in many countries , more or less conservative islamist parties are prepared to play the game . 
it is no coincidence if they are represented in the parliaments of all the countries that have committed political reforms , including lebanon , where hezbollah is part of a democratically elected government , jordan and morocco . 
in egypt , the muslim brotherhood have become a force to be reckoned with in parliament , despite the limits imposed on the participation of islamist groups in last year 's elections . 
in iraq , free elections have revealed the enormous influence of islamist currents . 
in turkey , the democratic transition brought to power an islamist party , the justice and development party . 
under his leadership , the turkish government has taken various important democratic reforms and began negotiations on the admission of turkey in the eu . 
islamist parties have nothing to do with al qaeda , even though some of the most conservative among them have ideological positions closer . 
the risk of a political transition that may lead to the victory of islamist parties is a democratic paradox that europe and the us must accept if they want to promote a political move that encompasses all political sensitivities - in other words the polar opposite of the imposition of democracy as it has in iraq , under occupation of foreign troops . 
one of the most negative consequences of the intervention in iraq was to reinforce the notion of a " clash of civilizations " between the west and islam which creates a climate conducive to islamist movements . 
the muslim world has made political reforms well before the " war against terrorism " and reformists were not waiting for the eu to become political clout to act . 
these movements were not created in the us or europe after the september 11 , and they do not expect a signal or help them to act . 
the success of muslim moderates could nevertheless to depend on the attitude of the eu and the us to them . 
it is not necessary to show that democracy is the best path for palestinians if they want to achieve their state . 
this depends largely on the new government of hamas , its transformation into a democratic strength , respects the rule of law , democracy and international law . 
but it also depends on israel and the international community , which must do everything in their power to encourage the emergence of a future palestinian state with jerusalem as its capital . 
supporting palestinian democratization does not prevent the international community to demand that hamas give up entirely on terrorism , to demilitarise , respect the palestinian constitution , and acknowledge the existence of israel . 
but this does not mean that we need to impose sanctions on the palestinian people , after he has spoken democratically . 
if we want to strengthen the recent palestinian democracy , it would be a terrible mistake that would have a negative impact in other arab countries seeking to reform . 
in the same way , recognise the right of non-violent islamists to participate in the political life does not mean the renunciation of the political and ideological struggle to overcome the ultra-conservative views and sometimes totalitarian society . 
combating racism , defend tolerance and respect the religious sentiments of others does not mean to question the freedom of the press or to accept the censorship that call for the islamists , even if real religious sentiments are injured , as in the case of the danish caricatures . 
islamist conceptions of society that violate individual rights must be rebutted politically . 
this political challenge is one of the paradoxes of democracy , because it allows all the ideas to compete freely with each other . 
political islam is a risk , but you cannot reduce that drafting a proper strategy , adapted to the case by case , and that goes in the direction of democracy , but not in denouncing the result of a democratic choice . 
the war against the " democratization " 
wars in lebanon and gaza seriously threaten democratic reform in the southern mediterranean basin . 
they are inflicting heavy penalties precisely the peoples of the region that have led free and fair elections , and they undermine the legitimacy of israel 's democracy . 
last year , the " cedar revolution " lebanon was an example of democratization in the arab world . 
the enthusiasm with which the international community has welcomed these changes has fallen flat . the elections which have taken place recently in palestine -- another longstanding international demand -- are in the same case . 
the message is clear : it is better that israel , the only country in the region to respect the rule of law , be surrounded by authoritarian regimes where the results of the elections are predictable rather than democratic states where islamists are likely to gain power . 
it happened in palestine , and it could well happen in egypt if the elections are conducted in a free and fair . 
arab nationalist governments could then justify resistance to political reforms and the suppression of any domestic opposition , in particular , swelling islamist movements . 
it is now obvious to everyone that the democratisation of the southern mediterranean cannot bypass islamist movements , and that the success of the process largely depends on the degree to which the participation of these movements is guaranteed in the political arena . 
of course , still must renounce violence as a means of achieving power . 
contain political islam , or attempting to " remove " islamists militarily without taking into account the national political processes ( not to mention human life ) , is not a solution , because the voters themselves not from islamist movements . 
the efforts of reformist governments in the region to integrate these movements in the public sphere have received a severe blow . 
democracies have long known that the indiscriminate punishment -- which , by definition affect both the allies that the enemies , the fighters as civilians -- is a grave violation of international law , as did louise arbour , united nations high commissioner for human rights . 
they also know that such action fuels radicalism and have the impact that we know only too well today . 
hezbollah is , after all , a creature of lebanon 's resistance to the israeli invasion in 1982 . the " party of god " is trying to impose itself at home and in the region by portraying itself as the champion of the arab-islamic cause , particularly in palestine . 
any strengthening of its power will weaken lebanon and the democratic forces in the region . 
the prolonged absence of a real active engagement of the us in the middle east peace process is partly responsible for the current morass . 
for nearly six years , they have not taken significant us diplomatic initiative to resolve the palestinian issue , or to pursue the syrian track ( israel still occupies the golan heights ) . 
what is more , even as we start to think that the iraqi tragedy had lifted the veil on the limits of unilateral disarmament and preventive military strategies , the bush administration encourages the israeli military action -- this time against a country that painfully trying to consolidate democratic reform and to reaffirm its sovereignty on syria . 
the initiative the most promising of bush , to promote democracy in all the way ‚Äë east , has been paralysed by the intervention in iraq and the ensuing civil war there . 
the project is now crushed under the weight of america 's inability to protect lebanon 's fragile democracy and the democratic experience of palestine . 
the feeble response to the european union to the conflict in gaza and lebanon has oscillated between understanding and condemnation of the disproportionate response of israel ( not " an eye for an eye , " but " ten eye for an eye , " according to the finnish presidency of the eu council ) , revealing how the union depends on the us to put an end to the violence . 
if the present conflict does not encourage europeans to speak with one voice , this means that they have learnt nothing from the disunity , thus weakness , which has damaged during the war in iraq . 
there should be a european initiative supported by a credible military deterrent , consisting of the forces of the eu , turkey and the arab countries , be dispatched in lebanon and gaza as part of a united nations mission . 
europe must not only demand an immediate ceasefire and put an end to the interference of syria and iran in lebanon , but it must also provide the means to translate its requirements in the facts and provide a massive aid to the reconstruction of lebanon . 
the eu should firmly support the end of the embargo on palestine and the urgent creation of a palestinian state . 
a common european front could convince the us to leave enough time to lebanon and palestine to consolidate their democratic processes , and therefore to isolate the radical elements of hamas and hezbollah to dissolve his private army . 
the us project in ruins , a credible european policy to delegitimize war and support for democracy in the countries of the region is crucial . 
the environment to the economy 
no economy is a closed , autonomous universe , governed by laws independent from law , the moral or politics . 
economic issues of the most interesting generally located on the border with neighboring disciplines . 
this cannot appear more clearly than in the interaction between economic processes and the environment . 
the peculiarity of this exchange is not to be governed by the laws of mechanics , but by thermodynamics , particularly the law of entropy , according to which the amount of free energy that can be transformed into mechanical work diminishes with the time -- an irreversible process culminating in " the death of the heat . " 
under the guidance of nicholas georgescu-roegen - whose work on the relationship between economic processes and physics pioneers - many researchers tried without success to formulate a theory entropique' " of the economy and society , especially during the 1970s . 
the point of view entropic assume that because of their multiple interactions with nature , economic processes produce irreversible consequences . 
we draw on stocks of non-renewable natural resources ( oil and mineral resources for example ) and degrade or modify the quality of other resources ( for example , water and agricultural land ) by imposing a pace of exploitation superior to their capacity for regeneration . 
the exploitation of non-renewable resources also released the " vitesse' economic growth of the ecological pace , which contributes to the deterioration of the biosphere , including irreversible climate changes . 
the law of entropy reminds us that we will leave to future generations a natural heritage lesser and probably less adapted to their needs that we inherited . 
unfortunately , there are no simple solutions . 
on behalf of what principle can we ask china and india to limit their economic dynamism to reduce their levy on the natural resources of the planet ? 
slower growth of developed countries is not the result of a voluntary restraint , but our higher standard of living and our inability to settle our own economic imbalances . 
we cannot impose the poorest that we the pace ecological , whereas it is to be released that has enriched ! 
for a similar reason , or even stagnation , is not a solution in the developed countries : it would imply that we either accept existing inequalities , forcing a regime aiming at an equal redistribution of resources . 
this would be the choice between a cynicism unsustainable and a totalitarian utopia . 
but luckily for us , our evolution depends not only on entropy , but also of the increase of knowledge and technological progress -- a process that is just as irreversible that the reduction of non-renewable resources or the degradation of the environment . 
thus , the economy has entropic for resources and historical for the production , the organisation and dissemination of knowledge . the prospects for sustainable development in economic and environmental terms residing in the space left between these two dynamic processes : the level of growth we choose must be based on a sufficient level of knowledge to ensure the sustainability of the system . 
yet nature as knowledge are public goods that require state intervention to be " produits' in sufficient quantities . 
the only way to overcome the finiteness of our world is to maintain as much space as possible between entropy and history by investing in education and research in the prospect of increasing the share of renewable energy , reduce energy consumption linked to our standard of living , and slowing the pace of exploitation of natural resources . 
such a strategy may be useless if it only serves to disengage to allow others to enrich themselves more quickly . 
but conceived as doing the mastery of two dynamic processes , the solution the ecological constraint could be an accelerator of growth . 
the race to embryonic cells continues 
scientific research is usually conducted to improve our lives , but it is also an industry , an industry that represents a huge investment by governments and businesses . 
the stakes and the potential benefits of some research subjects are exceptionally high , and that is why the recent announcement that the korean scientist hwang woo-suk fabricated the results of research on stem cells has been so widely . 
this episode highlights the ongoing race in global health research who plays in the field of stem cells . 
this is probably one of the largest medical history is available to everyone , and everyone , all the world could win the big prize . 
the last great scientific race of this type goes back to the human genome , which promises to change the future of a radical . 
this study was launched by the united states , from discoveries made in the wake of the atomic bombing of japan on the understanding of the scope of long-term genetic damage . 
the current research effort on stem cells and their potential is just as important , because it will lead to an equally radical medical revolution . 
a stem cell is special because it can reproduce the form in which it is different . 
while a skin cell or a liver , for example , can reproduce only more skin or liver , stem cells , which are the most robust at the beginning of human development , are " master " cells . 
when a fertilized egg turns into an embryo , and then a fetus , these initial stem cells show in one way or another the cells they produce how to become skin , liver , eye , or bone . 
we need to know how this transformation is activated . 
such knowledge would lead to enormous progress that may give rise to patents . 
a strong attention is focused on genetic diseases , including alzheimer 's and parkinson 's and muscular dystrophy . 
in these cases , stem cells would be used to repair nerve tissue . 
this would also benefit patients with spinal injuries or the backbone , any patient who have suffered strokes and paralysis . 
this would be gains in parallel fields , too , such as gene therapy . 
a stem cell changes of identity through a process of " triggering " , a signal that active literally the liver cell gene in the embryonic version of the cell . 
when researchers have figured out how to activate these switches , it might be possible to introduce stem cells in the human body and activate them so that they correctly replace damaged tissue , whoever they are . 
so it is not surprising , given its huge potential , teams of researchers have mobilized almost everywhere for embryonic stem cell research . 
the race has become a certain dynamism since the main player in the research , the united states , dropped out , owing to the influence of religion on the policy ( even if the state of california has decided not to miss out , and recently approved a $ 3 billion subsidy for embryonic stem cell research ) . 
the promise is so great , and the science does not need massive infrastructure , many small countries who are engulfed in the vacuum created by the united states in this area to enjoy it . 
any competent medical research center can enter the race , whether in mexico , ethiopia , indonesia or yemen . 
the winner may bring to his country 's economy the equivalent of a saudi oil field to . 
but , even if the whole world can prevail , science , at this level , is not just a " eureka " event to a simple breakthrough suddenly put an end to this race . 
the findings are progressive , and , because it is science , each step is announced and tested . 
this is how the institutions participating in research can gain momentum , that the attractive leaders the talent , the resources and prestige in an ecology intellectual rest . 
we find in the competition many smaller ones , jostling to produce quick results and impressive . 
in may 2005 , hwang 's research center in seoul reported a first success of importance . 
they claimed that they had developed a technique where new perfect stem cells could be cloned from ordinary cells . 
it was big news , because it implied that a sufficient number of stem cells could be made without controversy , allowing everyone to make quality research while avoiding that us president george w. bush described as " the use of a life to save a life . " 
in addition , the koreans did a routine step of our days and have claimed patent rights of the process . 
you could almost believe for a moment that south korea would become a world superpower health issues . 
we now know that the korean researchers have invented the whole thing . 
the investigation conducted by an investigative panel seoul national university concluded that the " cloned " stem cells were reality created by in vitro fertilisation . 
the fraud has surprised the entire scientific community , particularly the fact that the declaration of the korean researchers was so clearly unworkable . 
why , then , did they put their reputations and careers in game ? 
medical research has always had to face many challenges , even when the scientific quest was only a matter of discovery . 
today , the challenges are complicated by politics , market forces , and national interests . 
with stem cell research , huge fortunes depend on which group takes the lead , where that their laboratory is located . 
as the competition heats up , we should expect amazing developments , and no doubt other public relations gimmicks . 
islam and chinese diaspora asian 
when the prime minister of malaysia , dr mahathir mohamed , recently announced that he intended to resign , malaysians of chinese origin joined mahathir 's malay party loyalists in to ask him to reconsider his position . 
when mahathir agreed to stay on , even just for another 16 months , the sighs of relief from these chinese malaysians were the loudest of all . 
the fact that ethnic chinese malaysians rallied on the side of dr mahathir marks a quiet revolution in malaysian politics , which demonstrates how mahathir 's nationalist image has softened during his 22 years in power . 
it also shows how ethnic chinese have changed their opinion on the nationalist movement that once seemed so their hostile . 
during the overthrow colonial rulers of south-east asia four decades ago , ethnic chinese have often fled the nationalist movements that fought for independence . 
some movements saw the local chinese as foreigners or as intrinsically disloyal for having taken advantage of the years of imperial rule disproportionately . 
anti-chinese communal violence was widespread in the region . 
in the decades that followed , most chinese have continued to be wary of political parties linked to former national liberation movements . 
this fear is waning in malaysia . 
malaysia 's chinese citizens now view the prime minister mahathir as a bastion against a new form of violent extremism : the threat posed by muslim fundamentalism . 
such a bulwark is a necessity for the members of the huge chinese diaspora across south-east asia , not only in malaysia , where islamic extremism remains a small threat , but also in indonesia , where thousands of chinese have been killed and injured in the riots in recent years , and where thousands of others have seen their property damaged or lost . 
most of the southeast asia 's ethnic chinese admire as a gem , the presence of even a hint of allegiance to a secular distinction between faith and state in a muslim ruler . 
when this distinction exists among islamic believers as mahathir , evidence of secular tolerance represents a rare sign of modernity and commitment to progress . 
dr mahathir has always been a hard-headed modernist . 
it has recently started to admit that the " malay first " policies he has encouraged since 1969 have failed to give birth to a skilled malay elite essential to a new modern economy . 
mahathir calls the young malays to work harder , even if it is fully aware that such an appeal is unpopular . 
a large part of this new tone in malaysia 's ethnic politics went unnoticed because of the uproar surrounding mahathir 's efforts to discredit his former deputy , anwar ibrahim . 
this smear campaign by mr anwar cost mahathir 's party , the united malay national organization ( umno ) , a large part of his support among ethnic malays . 
indeed , during the 1999 national elections , mahathir retained power only thanks to chinese voters . 
now non-malays hope that he will reconsider the idea of special treatment for ethnic malays . 
such a reform is still anathema among malays . 
malaysia 's ethnic chinese are also impressed by the deft response of dr mahathir us demands to fight against terrorism . 
the prime minister has used this opportunity to soften his image of man opposed to the west in reaffirming its modernist and secular position against those who sympathized with islamic extremism . 
in doing so he revitalized the multi-cultural base of the national alliance that has ruled malaysia since independence in 1957 . 
all of this helped rally the chinese community in malaysia at his side . 
contrast this with the chinese in indonesia , a country where everything that is secular and modern is associated with political and cultural conformity with the nation-state . 
for 30 years , the former president suharto systematically discriminated against the ethnic chinese , while promoting a few privileged comrades who helped his family and military colleagues make huge , ill-gotten profits . 
in the eyes of the indigenous majority remained poor , such favoritism has painted the chinese as corrupt and unscrupulously greedy . 
despite memories of the massacre of chinese during the anti-communist purges of the 1960s , the chinese indonesia were not prepared to face intense hatred shown in the riots in may 1998 where arson and looting , and rapes of several chinese women have ravaged the chinese community . 
such violence still casts a shadow on ethnic relations in indonesia . 
successive indonesian governments led by the presidents habibie , abdulrahman wahid and megawati sukarnoputri were all encouraged the chinese to play a customary leading role in the trade . 
however , indonesian officials are reluctant to ensure the chinese that they retain equal rights as citizens , and they have allowed various forms of discrimination to crack down . 
the current tensions between 's secularists , religious believers , and various muslim extremist groups indonesia have rejected the chinese in the shadows , allowing a large number of them to resume their economic role in conditions of growing uncertainty . 
but the personal security they crave , and that malaysia 's ethnic chinese are achieving , is as far away as ever . 
indeed , it is unlikely that indonesia produce a leader on which they could count in the same way that malaysia 's chinese now rely on the prime minister mahathir . 
football and philosophy 
gooooal ! ! ! 
heavenly bliss , or hellish pain , according to the team which marks : ours , or theirs . 
how the trajectory of a ball responsible for so much pain or bliss ? 
i have spent weeks sitting in front of my television watching the world cup . 
my wife threat of divorce and other disciplinary measures . 
what is the source of this attraction , this magic ? 
the world of the game is our permanent garden of eden . 
at any moment we may abandon our reality for freedom , the innocence and the happiness of the game . 
football and the garden of eden ? 
what do they have in common ? 
each defines a sacred sphere of freedom and order , innocence , spirituality and justice from our everyday world chaotic , bondage , injustice and guilt . 
the chessboard , the tennis court , the soccer field : within their boundaries we feel free , because in these places , it is we who make the rules without being subjected to the iron laws of the outside world . 
we feel innocent too , because the world of the game is also a world of innocence : a garden of eden before the fall . 
here we can be childishly selfish , we can fulfill our need for success , power and domination , and all without guilt . 
in the world of the game , freedom is generated , paradoxically , by the restrictions . 
in soccer , the basic rule is simple : the ball must move , from the central point , into one of the goals . 
if the ball was heading directly from the central point to a cage , his path would be , or appear to be , strictly determined and all would be boring . 
to create a certain freedom , the regulation intervenes in the way the ball and complicate the displacement . 
first , two teams of 11 players are put on the ground with the task of getting the ball into the goal . 
then , we ask them to get the ball in the cage of the goals of the other side . 
with twenty-two players with their own wills and skills , thanks to various movements of confrontation and cooperation , the number of possible combinations is high and to infinity . 
following this , there is only one factor in creating a true world of happy surprises , freedom and happiness : the ball . 
balls are among the most important in the " creation of freedom " in our lives . 
a ball is freedom personified . 
it can bounce in any direction . 
it seems to be its " own will . 
it is a subject , and yet , it seems to be free . 
with the introduction of a factor of chance and unpredictability in the game , the ball transforms a bitter and down-to-earth human fight in an epiphany of spirituality and freedom . 
in its brisk movements , chance and men will interact , dance , do somersaults with one another . 
the ball flashes of fro in happy irresponsibility , between the desire of men and chance , freedom and limitation , the success and failure , hope and despair , to pick up in the world of hope in the next moment . 
it has its own universe . 
it moves in the sphere of the sacred . 
but the sacred does not exist without the layman . 
the soccer field is circumscribed and opposed to the surrounding world . 
the experience and the sacred ceremony would be incomplete if the tension between the ground and the gallery did not exist . 
the ground of emerald and freedom of the game must be opposed by the howling mob in the darkness of the gallery , burning red torches and jerking between ecstasy and hellish misery . 
in our everyday lives , reason and passions are mixed . 
soccer ( like other sports ) between these two areas and opposed . 
all the passions , emotions and instincts are pushed to viewers . 
they rage and love , swagger and explode , and finally reach the catharsis ( if their team wins ) or hells ( if their team loses ) . 
at the same time , they watch , perceive , and the experience of freedom or the platonic apollonian game going on in the ground . 
yes , players move in a world of spirituality . 
they act according to clear , sacred rules . 
when they play , they are supposed to act as pure rational beings who leave behind them passions and emotions , fears and intimate the wishes of their daily lives . 
they live in a world of pure morality and justice . 
the player 's world is a world of justice and total impartiality ; of a perfect equality of opportunity , that we never get on a daily basis . 
even the advantage that provides the direction of the wind is controlled . 
the two teams change sides at the half . 
where and when do we see the privileged and the underprivileged , change hand in the real world ? 
players , too , are not supposed to break the rules . 
if they do , they are punished and , if they start again , they are excluded from the game . 
they are excluded from the sphere of spirituality and we see them disappearing in hells chill of the changing room . 
the expulsion from paradise comes only if the sanctity of the game has been desecrated , if the fate is broken : by players falling out of their angelic role and starting a fight on the ground , by a cheating referee , by the public realizing that a match has been fixed , by spectators invading the ground . 
such events mark long the public and the community . 
it is a bitter shock to realize the fragility of our world of freedom , spirituality , dignity and awaken again ( as we will do it when the winner of the world cup will be known ) in our world , nothing less than hostile . 
egypt has a need for a president , not a pharaoh 
a heated debate on the political reforms in egypt . 
by all opposition parties and civil society groups , it is essentially about a request for an amendment to the constitution of 1971 and abolishing the state of emergency declared anwar sadat 's assassination in . 
these demands are not new . 
president mubarak and the ruling national democratic party oppose it since the mid-1980s . 
but , given the ominous developments in egypt , in the region and beyond , the requirement of reforms is now taking a compelling character . 
internally , the 76 years of president mubarak and his state of health are a source of concern . 
the rumours about this run for years , but they have not been confirmed officially that in november 2003 , when he was no longer possible to mask the situation . 
while speaking in parliament , mubarak vanished under the eyes of millions of viewers . 
although he returned an hour later to finish his speech , egyptians began to demand greater transparency regarding the health of the president that the operation of the state . 
at the same time , the worsening economic situation , the high unemployment rate and widespread corruption have led to despair part of youth . 
more than half of the egyptian population is born under the presidency of mubarak . 
according to a recent un report , half of young people between 15 and 30 years old dream to emigrate to europe , north america and australia . 
every week , articles speak of egyptians who drown in the mediterranean while they are in europe . 
a few weeks ago , several young suffocated to death while being deported back to egypt in overcrowded trucks crossing the libyan desert . 
this case has led to protests that have forced the authorities to arrest , interrogate , and translate the egyptian police officers in charge of the facts . 
the situation in the region and the world has made the opposition more daring , not only for demanding reforms , but also to amend the articles of the constitution that pertain to the presidency . 
and rumors mubarak , who has already been re-elected four times , seek a sixth term or to establish a " hereditary republic . " he prepares his son gamal , 41 years , to succeed him , in the image of the syrian president hafez al-assad and son , bashar . 
the opposition battle cry is no , not the re-election of mubarak and not to gamal to succeed him . 
many egyptians have nothing against gamal mubarak as such , but they are mortified to the idea that having suffered the father for 24 years , they may see inflict the son for the same period . 
on 211 articles of the current constitution , which date of october 1971 , 30 relate to the presidency . 
the appointment of the president to a two-thirds majority of the people 's assembly is then ratified by a plebiscite to which we cannot respond by yes or no . 
the presidential term to six years , acquired the simple majority , is renewable indefinitely in this way . 
these lax procedures truly with the scope of presidential power . 
the president is the head of state and commander in chief , he chairs the supreme judiciary council , the police and the council of ministers . it can at its discretion to appoint and dismiss one or several vice-presidents . 
he also appoints the prime minister and senior ministers and approved the appointment of other ministers , ambassadors , and senior officials . 
he can call general elections , declare war , impose a state of emergency and issue decrees that have the force of law . 
there is no balance of powers . 
an article states that " the president can be impeached for high treason or any other criminal act if a motion tabled by at least a third of the members of the people 's assembly approved by two thirds of them . " 
the president is then suspended from his duties and replaced by vice-president pending the conclusion of the process . 
but mubarak has never enacted the law needed for the implementation of this article or appointed a vice-president , despite repeated requests from all sides . 
the result has been a de facto " imperial presidency , " with mubarak in the place of the pharaoh . 
no other head of state of modern history does between his hands as much power . 
in egypt , compared more readily to brezhnev who chaired during two decades to stagnation and the decline of the soviet union . 
in the same way , the position of egypt as a regional power collapsed under mubarak . 
on the economic front , the flow of foreign investment has plummeted from $ 3 billion per year in the mid-1990s to a minuscule $ 300 million in 2003 . 
demands for reform are now focused on the election of the president by universal suffrage with at least two candidates and the banning of more than two consecutive terms . 
but it should also reduce the presidential power in what he has to abusive and create effective mechanisms for all the officials without exception have to account for their actions . 
if mubarak and his government do nothing for the constitutional amendments claimed to be adopted , increasingly egyptians will desert the regime and risk their lives to seek salvation elsewhere . 
bush should no longer play the gulf 
president bush has asked americans not " play politics " in this period of terrible national disaster . 
but asking hard questions to the leaders of our nation is exactly what democracy demands at a time when the government 's response to hurricane katrina is widely viewed as " a national disgrace . " 
katrina came at least two days in advance , but the authorities have been slow to issue an evacuation order . 
there was no transportation for those who had neither money nor car ; the reception facilities and care for refugees were insufficient , the necessary forces were not in place to deliver desperately needed supplies or to ensure the next , and the number of boats , helicopters and other equipment necessary to rescue those who were stranded was far from sufficient . 
hampered by a national guard with 40 % of the workforce are in iraq , the speed of mobilisation of the military to the worst affected areas has been slow . 
for four days , there was simply no clear center of command and control . 
as a result , many victims suffered and died . 
this failure is largely attributable to the bush administration 's policies , which effectively eroded the capabilities of the federal agency emergency management ( fema ) , government agency whose primary mission is to manage the disasters . 
obsessed with the war against terrorism , as well as by the ideology of privatizing the functions of government , the administration has systematically undermined the ability of the fema to prevent the disasters in the long term or at least cushion the blows when prevention is still possible . 
fema has been restricted and downgraded its cabinet position , before being placed under the department of national security . 
its mission of disaster planning and preparation has been dropped entirely , to the benefit of the fight against terrorists . 
its leaders have no experience in disaster management . 
the director precedent was one of bush 's texas political cronies , and the current director 's qualifications include the task of commissioner for judges and the service of the international arabian horse association , where he has been forced to resign for " lack of supervision " . 
since 2001 , billions of dollars have been postponed aid to disaster management to national security and the war in iraq . 
the rescue post-disaster disaster have seen their budget as snow melt in the sun and the federal funds have been cut in half . 
the budget of army corps of engineers for the construction of levees in new orleans has been gutted , including funds specifically allocated to the urban flood control of southwest louisiana . 
preventive measures to protect the population and the properties have not been implemented despite the conclusions of the fema in 2001 that a major hurricane hitting new orleans was one of the three " likeliest and the more catastrophic which could hit this country . " 
convinced that fema was a social programme " disproportionate " and that " the government 's job is not to provide services , " the first fema director bush has established supply requirements as part of a major privatization effort . 
this provoked a brain drain as fema have turned to the private sector . 
the privatisation has also put the states and the poorest communities in a particularly vulnerable position . 
as money dried up and federal programs were delivered into the hands of private companies at higher rates , only the states and communities the richest and politically consistent had the resources of the scarce federal grants necessary to pay for services . 
for example , florida ( which has 16 more voice that louisiana and where the governor is the brother of the president ) has received the requested funding to protect its wetlands . 
in contrast , louisiana , which has the needs more consistent ( with his incredible 24 % poverty rate ) , has been in 2004 denied its request to fund to prevent floods . 
in louisiana 's ability to protect itself weakened and the center of disaster relief undermined , the inadequate government response and unnecessary destruction were almost inevitable . and it is the poor who have paid the price . 
but the failure of this administration exceed the chronic and intentional diversion of resources programmes to protect the people of disasters . 
despite the scientific evidence proving that the increased intensity and frequency of hurricanes are linked to climate change , the bush administration rejects any participation in international programmes designed to preserve the climate . 
rather than comply with the ban on wetlands development instituted by previous administrations , the bush chose to remove it . 
the erosion caused by urban development has brought the gulf of mexico 20 miles of land by report in 1965 , hurricanes are able to concentrate more strength and cause winds and waves at the speed and destructive power stronger . 
similarly , the reduction of wetlands threatened the levees in new orleans , built on the principle that 60 to 80 miles of protective swamp as buffer between the city and the gulf of mexico . 
in spite of all the major study showing that a rehabilitation programme the coast of great magnitude and higher levees was necessary to protect new orleans , the government has allowed federal agencies to stop protecting 8,000 ha swamps , developers to drain hundreds of acres and in 2004 has reduced by more than 80 % funding for holding back the waters of lake pontchartrain . 
new orleans has sounded the alarm of america . 
the ideologies of privatisation , which prevent to govern effectively and allow the privileged to save their skin while the poor must climb on roofs , must now be challenged . 
this disaster is a chilling reminder of what happens when government fails to protect its citizens , and it is imperative that americans demand accountability . 
the officials who have not done their job must be dismissed , and elected officials whose policies have aggravated the devastation wrought by katrina dismissed . 
we owe it to the dead and to the survivors . 
the autumn of commandante 
only gabriel garcia score can find the right words to describe the expectations of the death of fidel castro . 
his novel the autumn of the patriarch captures perfectly the moral squalor , political paralysis and savage ennui that enshrouds a society awaiting the death of a long-term dictator . 
the departure of the power of commandante fidel is only a matter of biology , and the few pictures of him that have emerged since he fell ill last year clearly show the nature at work . 
when the end comes , the change in cuba could be as scale than any of those who have welcomed the end of the last century 's great dictators . 
stalin , franco , tito , mao : their means and methods are all looked like . 
the way they exited the stage was often very different on the other hand , and these differences can shape the companies for years and decades after their death . 
take the example of the soviet union . 
on march 9 , 1953 , the gulf of finland to the bering sea , everything is arrested , just as in warsaw , budapest , prague and east berlin . 
in beijing , mao zedong himself bowed low an enormous effigy of joseph stalin . 
huge mourning crowds , crying , almost hysterical , could be seen all over the vast empire stalin had ruled . 
and yet , in a few days , the word stalinism was removed from a new soviet dictionary , and three years later , my grandfather , nikita khrushchev , denounced " the cult of personality " stalin in his famous " secret speech " at the 20th congress of the communist party . 
the thawing that followed was short-lived , but for the first time in soviet history the possibility of a change had been considered -- possibility that mikhail gorbachev seized upon in 1985 . 
the death of marshal josip broz tito of outpouring of another sort . 
for decades , his rule imposed a false unity in yugoslavia . 
after his death in 1980 , that artificial state began to unravel , culminating with the genocidal wars in bosnia , croatia and kosovo in the 1990s . 
but all the long dictatorships do not end in disintegration and chaos . 
mao 's death the return from exile of deng xiaoping in disgrace . 
deng quickly routed the heirs of the " gang of four " , and in a few years ago , opened the chinese economy , fueling a capitalist revolution that transformed china more completely , and with more success , that mao 's socialist revolution had ever done . 
the communist party , of course , remains in power , and mao 's portrait still looms on tiananmen square . 
but one as the other are mere relics of ideas and ideals that in reality have been consigned to the dustbin of history . 
spain , too , escaped violent dissolution when generalissimo francisco franco 's fascist dictatorship collapsed at his death . 
the old dictator can claim credit this success , since in restaurant the monarchy of king juan carlos just before he died , it gave spain a foundation on which to rebuild . 
franco was not imagine that juan carlos would build , aided by a clever young of the franco era bureaucrat named adolfo suarez , modern and democratic spain today . 
it is no coincidence that communist countries were ( and are ) usually run by geriatrics , and democracies by younger men and women . 
this difference has its importance . 
old leaders can chair with success of the country where everything works quietly , and which do not require new examination of their policies and their objectives . 
there are exceptions to this rule , of course -- churchill , adenauer , deng , reagan -- but states cannot count on the fortune to give them a leader exceptional . 
younger leaders are more likely to be able to cope with the many changes of difficult times . 
political competition obliges all politicians , whatever their age , to remain alert and to anticipate problems , and remain open to new ideas . 
no one can keep himself ensconced in his office to wait to death or his own boredom . 
one-party systems , dictatorships playing on the charisma of a single man or a mixture of both , as in tito 's yugoslavia , are a guarantee of sclerotic minds and inertia of governments . 
what will become of cuba after fidel ? 
many observers describe ra√∫l castro , fidel 's younger brother and his designated successor , as a pragmatist -- the " practical castro . " 
when the soviet largesse have stopped in the early 1990s , it is ra√∫l who understood that the regime 's survival depended on economic reforms and has lobbied to allow private agricultural markets to reopen in order to boost production and avoid a possible famine . 
however , this is the same man who , at the head of cuba 's internal security apparatus , for many years represented the iron hand of the regime , and who is directly responsible for the prison , and often torture , thousands of dissidents . 
so perhaps the best that can be hoped for is a russian-style experiment with liberalisation quickly stifled by the regime 's nervous old guard . 
in addition , with the support of oil-rich allies such as venezuelan president hugo ch√°vez -- and with the recent discovery of crude reserves off the cuban coast , introducing reforms could well become less urgent . 
in this case , ra√∫l may try to cling firmly to the fossilized system that he helped to create and maintain with such brutality . 
but ra√∫l castro is an old man himself , so we can hope that a deng or , better yet , a suarez , from the wreckage of fidelism . 
that said , for the moment , younger communist officials , as foreign minister felipe perez roque , remain fanatics of ideology that many cubans call " los taliban . " 
if they take power and retain the finger on the trigger , cuba could face a new long biology lesson . 
the ecb now serves as an anchor to europe 
the time has come for the european central bank to build a reputation . 
barely a month after the rejection of the constitutional treaty of the european union in france and the netherlands , the recent summit of the european union in brussels ended in a surprisingly acrimonious orgy of national egoisms without any agreement is reached on the eu budget . 
with europe in turmoil , the ecb must be present as a stabilising anchor . 
europe is suffering from a profound crisis of confidence its economic recovery . 
consumers , lacking confidence in the ability of their political leaders to solve these problems , save for the bad days that they believe very close , while the businessmen are reluctant to invest because they do not trust government to put in place the necessary economic reforms . 
as shown by the shameful brussels summit , this lack of trust in the political leadership of the european union is entirely justified . 
instead of actually doing something constructive on the problems of europe -- the reform expensive welfare states to for a better overall competitiveness -- europe 's political leaders are hiding behind false arguments on " ultra liberal anglo saxon models , " and the high interest rates , as if the economic weaknesses were due to the mistakes of the ecb . 
to undermine the independence of the ecb , european finance ministers are seeking to gain more weight in the decision-making of the bank . 
jean-claude juncker , luxembourg prime minister and president of the eurogroup , testifying before the economic and financial affairs council of the european union parliament , said that the euro zone finance ministers were to be more vigorous in the expression of their positions in relation to the ecb . he called for " open and frank " talks between the ministers and the ecb . 
who needs these talks ? 
in a joint together , the euro zone finance ministers want to discuss the reduction of interest rates , which does not help the economic recovery of europe . 
the ecb has already extended the period of monetary stability in europe with interest rates to the lowest for years . 
does anyone really believe consumers refuse to consume -- and businessmen postponing their investments -- in anticipation of the next drop in interest rates ? 
to paraphrase mr keynes , we cannot do drink a donkey which has not thirst . 
" the last thing europe needs now is an interest rate cut , " declared an influential member of the ecb 's governing council in a candid assessment of the current situation . capitulate under external pressure is not a good definition of an " anchor . " 
the euro would collapse , and the ecb would lose credibility in quality of central bank . 
in addition , the chief economist of the ecb , otmar issing , provides that long-term interest rates would go up , not down , since inflation forecasts are on the increase . 
thus , the reduction of interest rates would not only wrong , it would be crazy . 
but the ecb will not reduce its rates , even if it argues that this would be possible to take the political wolves at a distance . 
the ecb is maintained , and in so doing , it proves to european citizens that there is at least a european institution in which they can have confidence . 
this is extremely important . 
history shows that the unrest policies lead to inflation , which in turn feeds into further turmoil . 
europeans can bet their last euro on the ecb : it will not let his young common currency be ravaged by inflation because of the political leaders having failed in their task which now fear losing their burden . 
indeed , the courage shown by the ecb in sticking to its principles should serve as a model for future european politicians . 
when they realize they can not force the ecb to interest rate cuts and self-destructive , european leaders will find so maybe the courage to govern , which , after all , is the reason for which they were elected . 
the rush to the succession of arafat 
to understand what will the palestinian cause without yasser arafat , consider the various titles that it currently holds . 
arafat is chairman of the executive committee of the plo , president of the palestinian national authority , commander in chief of the palestinian forces and leader of the fatah movement . 
the plo embodies palestinian national aspirations for independence and become a state . 
it is the highest political body for all palestinians , both for those living in palestine that refugees and other palestinians of the diaspora . 
arafat 's successor will have to juggle between negotiations with israel , which will require concessions on the " right of return " of refugees in palestine , and the aspirations of more than three million palestinians who want to return to the homes from which they were expelled in the wars of 1948 and 1967 . 
arafat 's successor as president of the palestinian national authority will be bound by the oslo accords , which created an interim government , currently led by prime minister ahmad qurei , which is responsible for the day-to-day lives of palestinians in the west bank and the gaza strip . 
palestinians will have to decide if the president of the pna a solid position or merely symbolic , as is currently the case . 
the second option would make qurei an empowered prime minister , which want to many palestinians and others . 
the position of the commander of palestinian forces supposedly puts the various military units , security and palestinian intelligence into the hands of a single leader , who is supposed to uphold the law . 
but these forces are now in disarray , the majority uniformed palestinian security agencies to be reorganized after four years of intensive efforts by israel to crush them . 
the key factor in internal security lies in the local paramilitary units . 
these units , most of which are not controlled by the pna 's central leadership , are more loyal to the leaders of the basis that the pna officers in uniform . 
local fatah leaders like marwan barghouti have tremendous power on the nationalist armed units that are loosely organized under the title of the al aqsa martyrs " brigades . 
barghouti advocated and has tried to implement internal fatah elections when the israelis have arrested . 
as the leader of street elected to the presidency of the council of bir zeit university student , earned his legitimacy by being chosen by his peers . 
when the oslo process began , he refused to accept any official position within the palestinian authority , choosing instead to remain close to the local fatah cadres . 
the one who will take the place of arafat will have to ensure that these brigades are convinced that their status , their demands and their leaders are respected . 
indeed , the fight for power , which will be held in the post-arafat era will ultimately center on al fatah , the backbone of the plo . 
a worldwide assembly chooses the revolutionary council of fatah , which is made up of 100 members and who will elect to turn a central committee , in which will focus the bulk of the struggle for power . 
many young street leaders will insist on an emergency meeting of the revolutionary council , or even holding the sixth general assembly ( which will be the first since 1988 ) . 
the events in recent months show that the al asqa martyrs brigades have forced even arafat to take their demands into consideration . 
while most of the struggle for power will be held in the nationalist camp , however , we must not forget the islamist camp led by hamas and islamic jihad . 
although it is unlikely that the islamists interfere in the post-arafat power struggle , they will not sit idly by if the new leader launches in the wrong direction . 
of course , the new leader will have to reach an agreement with the islamists regarding the rules of the game , both domestically and towards israel . 
without this agreement , and if the new leader is rife hard against the islamists , a violent civil war could erupt . 
more importantly , in order to consolidate his leadership , the next palestinian leader must take measures difficult and show some tangible results quickly . 
the experience of the first palestinian prime minister , who resigned in large part because of his inability to make improvements to its people ( especially in personal and collective security , the rule of law , and the end of the chaos in palestinian areas ) remains fresh in the memory of the population . 
at the same time , a freeze of settlement activity , the release of political prisoners palestinians , including marwan barghouti , and the removal of the hundreds of checkpoints between palestinian cities would revive a feeling of hope , without which no palestinian leader can negotiate what the world wants : a peace agreement . 
the problem is that no palestinian leader , whatever it is , cannot make these changes . 
they represent a direct challenge to the israeli occupiers , neighboring arab countries and the international community , led by the united states . 
the mystery of 2008 moscow 
usually at this period , people are obsessed with what is going to give them the new year . 
in russia , the real uncertainty concerns 2008 , not 2007 . 
indeed , one can reduce today russian policy to a single subject : president vladimir putin stay to the presidency after 2008 , despite its repeated assertions that this is not the case ? 
and if he has the place , which it will be to succeed him ? 
its dolphin belong to one of the kremlin 's feuding factions ? 
or will he pick a " abroad " ? 
unless putin retains its position as the ultimate arbiter and decision-making of the country , there are big risks that a fierce infighting . 
in an environment where power and property are inseparable and all government institutions are emasculated , a transfer of the supreme authority may lead to violent redistribution . 
resolve these issues is vital for russia 's political elites who are anxious to preserve their current perks and gain others . 
with regard to the public , the vast majority appears resigned to accept any solution arranged by the power . 
some 45 % of russians believe that putin will name his successor , and that this person will become the new president . 
almost a quarter believe that the constitution be amended so that putin can have a third term . 
in a sense , as in the other , it is almost universally recognised that the transfer of presidential authority is fixed to the summit and endorsed by the ballot box . 
the balance of forces in the legislature , too , will be determined by the kremlin . 
in recent years , the configuration of the political parties and the law on elections have been changed several times in order to adapt to the interests of the ruling elite . 
therefore , unwanted forces have no chance in the parliamentary elections in december . 
foreigners to politics , ordinary russians are indifferent to everything that does not immediately affect them , and do not seek to hold anyone accountable . 
they have not been disturbed by the recent murder of the journalist anna politkovskaya , or the assassination of andrei kozlov , vice-president of the central bank , or the implications of the poisoning of alexander litvinenko ( a majority of respondents in a survey said that he had been killed by his " business partners . " ) 
this alienation between the state and the nation has a long tradition in russia , just as the public apathy . 
but these days the apathy is reinforced by improving the standard of living . 
thanks to the windfall oil and gas , russians live better that they have never lived in the communist era . 
moreover , it may be argued that the story has never seen such a large proportion of russians with a decent standard of living . 
as a result , people have become even more compliant with a government increasingly autocratic . 
of course , there are many reasons to complain , and people may grumble , but they will not come together to oppose the status quo . 
marginal political groups and figures who organise a protest find themselves facing official pressure and even harassment , which is new reasons for the public to turn away from them . 
as the election result is a foregone conclusion , it may be that many are simply not vote . 
in fact , russia today has hardly a reason to muster active support . 
on the contrary , public participation is seen as an obstacle to the objectives of the bureaucracy : its own perpetuation and control over lucrative assets . 
if members of the russian elite have never acted modernizing ambitions , they have abandoned , because without public participation , modernization is an illusion . 
instead , the kremlin relies increasingly on the conservative , soviet-style electorate , as its power base , while alienating the advanced , entrepreneurs and better trained . 
stephen jennings , president of the council of renaissance capital , an investment group with a decade of experience in russia , recently noted the country 's " contradictory trends " : the emergence of a " burgeoning middle class " alongside a " highly centralized government , raising a new class of state oligarchs and a mushrooming bureaucracy . " 
the problem is that the best and brightest of russia , which jennings praised for " the big management skills , professionalism , productivity and social and economic ambition , " did not seem to mind their remoteness of political decision making . 
they can regret the kremlin 's economic policies , but they put up with the rampant corruption of russia and its disgraceful ratings in competitiveness indices , as they put up with the general erosion of democracy , the manipulation of the judicial system and weak law enforcement . 
like their less advanced compatriots , they do not seek to hold the government accountable or call for change . 
for now , life is good enough as it is . 
therefore , if the smooth transition of 2008 is threatened , or if there is a risk of destabilisation , its origin is not able to find that in infighting at the top , and not in the audience . 
optimists hope that one day russia 's burgeoning middle class will take responsibility for the future of russia and demand a radical improvement to govern . 
but what would trigger a shift from passive compliance to active public participation ? 
if a times breed political apathy , and bad policies lead to a socioeconomic decline , russia 's best and brightest could be outstripped by populist forces . 
fight against drugs : we must change strategy 
once again , russia and ukraine are victims of an illusion . 
since the end of communism in 1991 , the use of banned drugs has increased dramatically in these two countries ( and others ) . 
they have reacted by draconian measures in line with the policy simplistic to the total elimination of drugs adopted by the un . 
today , these policies are contributing to the explosion of aids in many developing countries . 
the un conventions governing drugs policy at international level do not take into account the recent findings on drug use and addiction . 
most of these conventions have been established long before the appearance of aids , which is spread mainly by injection drug use in the countries of the former soviet union and in many asian countries . 
thus , at international level , it is in russia and ukraine that aids is spreading the faster . 
the number of people infected with hiv has multiplied by 18 during the past five years . 
it is estimated that one and a half million russians and ukrainians 400.000 are affected , and at least 85 % of them would be to intravenous drug use . 
in a misguided attempt to comply with un conventions , the russian and ukrainian governments use the bulk of their resources to fight against drugs to repression . 
drug users are victims of abuse of the police and are thrown out by the health services , even for vital treatment . 
and during this time , the drugs continue to flood the market . 
on drugs , the crackdown has never managed to eliminate the request . 
the repression takes into account economic and social factors , nor the public health issues related to the use of banned substances . 
locking up drug users is not a solution ; in russia , it is easier to buy drugs in prison than outside . 
in a repressive climate , drug users who avoid arrest tend to be the subject of discrimination , which does not encourage them to protect their health and the health of those around them . 
if the company offers no hope addicts and showed no compassion towards them , drug abuse and the aids virus spread rapidly . 
russia and ukraine are not the only to cope with the increase of intravenous drug abuse and the spread of aids . 
if they continue this type of policy , pakistan , iran , china , the countries of central asia and all the countries who are in the same situation will face the same disaster in terms of public health . 
many work throughout the world shows that in the fight against drugs , the action in the field of public health is the most effective way to reduce hiv infection and reduce the expenditure . 
the british medical journal lancet estimated that the us would have saved at least $ 500 million if they had put in place a programme for needle exchange at national level during the program between 1987-1995 . 
an international survey shows that the infection with hiv has fallen 5,8 % in cities where syringe exchange programs , but it has increased 5,9 % in cities where there is not . 
any study of importance is highlights a correlation between the existence of an exchange programme of needles and an increase in drug addiction . 
studies in the us , australia and elsewhere show that if the number of drug addicts who benefit from a treatment is not falling , it is because the participants in the needle exchange programmes have easier access to it . 
the un agencies such as the commission on narcotic drugs or the un office on drugs and crime ( unodc , are not mandated to prescribe a specific strategy to fight drugs . 
however , their narrow conception of the fight against drugs has a strong influence on policy and member nations . 
many governments , obsessed with respect to the un conventions , cannot or will not take account of the negative effects in terms of public health of a policy strictly repressive fight against drugs . 
in the 1990s , when aids has started to kill millions of people in africa , infecting more than 25 % of the population of some countries , the international institutions have hijacked the head . 
for similar reasons , this terrible epidemic is preparing to strike between other countries of the former soviet union . 
have we learned nothing ? 
it is not too late , policymakers at the national and international level to reconsider their strategy . 
despite the un conventions , some countries have adopted a more pragmatic approach to drugs and aids . 
consider that it is above all a public health problem can combat much more effectively the aids epidemic . 
the following steps to get there : 
¬∑ adopt anti-discrimination legislation to guarantee the civil liberties and human rights drug users and people affected by hiv . 
¬∑ recognise that the use of the drugs is a public health problem and not respect the law or policing and implement a policy that reflects this . 
¬∑ explicitly legalize needle exchange programmes and the treatments by methadone and other alternative products . 
¬∑ create national programs to reduce the risks that are pragmatic and accessible to all . this happening by education , the replacement therapies , the rehabilitation programmes and needle exchange . 
¬∑ both nationally and internationally , include drug users and their advocates in developing policy on drugs . 
refuse to reconsider the aims to restructure anti-drug strategies and will only worsen the aids epidemic and contribute to the deaths of millions of vulnerable people . 
the abandonment of the resolutions of lisbon 
as soon as he takes office at the post of president of the european commission , durao barroso - former prime minister of portugal - should devote urgent to restoring order and focus to the economic policies of the european union . 
the thickest file on the expected is that of the resolutions of lisbon , an ambitious programme approved in 2000 by the heads of state and government of the european union with the aim of making the union " the most competitive and dynamic economy " as soon as 2010 . 
the main economic fields are covered : innovation and entrepreneurship , the reform of social systems and social inclusion , skills and employment , equality of the sexes at work , the liberalisation of labour markets and goods and sustainable development . 
it is certain that these are worthy goals , to be sure , but they belong intrinsically to the sphere of national political decisions . 
indeed , according to the european treaties , the union has no authority to enact legislation and policy in these areas , nor the power to enforce them . 
however , the council of europe , encouraged by the european commission , invented a new policy approach - called " open coordination " - to be able to affect these areas . 
open coordination entails the determination of common objectives at european union level , voluntary compliance by the member states and internal control of results in the council of europe . 
of course , open coordination has failed to deliver on its promises . 
in addition , the illusion that the council of europe can somehow call growth and productivity has provided a diversion to national politicians who do not want to make the promotion at the national level of unpopular decisions . 
thus , i suggest to mr barroso , in a prime time , get rid of the resolutions of lisbon . 
this is the only thing to do to make clear that national responsibilities remain in the hands of national politicians on economic performance . 
this brings me to macro-economic coordination at european union level . 
the maastricht treaty envisaged a simple policy framework for economic and monetary union . 
monetary policy was centralized and entrusted to an independent central bank , while fiscal policy was left to the member states . 
national governments were subject to the dual constraint - according to the procedure of control excessive deficits - aimed at preventing the fiscal deficits of more than 3 % of gdp and budget deficits of more than 60 % of gdp ( or at least around this value ) . 
subsequently , the stability and growth pact added an additional criterion , in the medium term , for that national budgets are balanced or " almost " . 
essentially , this aimed to prevent irresponsible budgetary policies after the launch of the euro , while leaving enough space to cyclical oscillations deficits in the limit of 3 % . 
the credibility of this arsenal was badly damaged by the november 2003 public controversy between the commission and the ecofin council on the application of the control procedure budget deficits to france and germany . 
this does not mean that it should be abandoned . 
on the contrary , a common external constraint on fiscal behavior is necessary for a joint safeguard against an unsustainable accumulation of public debt , which could affect financial stability and inflation across the european union - an increased risk by the impact of ageing populations on pension systems . 
such a constraint also provides a welcome anchor for domestic decision-making in member states with weaker political systems . 
but the system needs to be reviewed . 
i would not listen to those who defend the exclusion of investment from fiscal deficits : this would only offer new incentives for creative accounting and unsustainable accumulation of debt . 
instead , the focus should be on the viability of the debt rather than on the annual deficits . 
the debt criterion , for example , could be accompanied by a limit on the ( trend ) growth rate of public spending , which would be kept below the nominal gdp . 
the power of the commission to launch the movement when there is a risk of excessive deficits should be strengthened - unless , of course , the commission never again forgets that the follow-up of national policies is a task that requires a certain sense policy and cannot be left to accountants and lawyers . 
finally , we must make european integration the main priority for which the union has a powerful legal instrument to force the opening up of markets and strengthen competition . 
the best therapy for boosting growth must be both direct , by increasing competitive pressure , and indirect , by triggering the necessary adaptation national policies on employment , social welfare and education . 
this is a long haul . 
state aid to ailing companies remain ambiguous and common rules designed to ensure the free movement of goods and services are not fully respected by the member states - the public markets and energy are the best examples . 
moreover , most markets of services - the trade securities , wholesale and retail distribution , business services , and local public services - remain protected competition and the regulation of free trade . 
the evidence is there that show that these distortions in the market for services , which represents two thirds of gdp are responsible for the bulk of the eu 's productivity gap with the united states . 
in recent years , the council of europe has not paid enough attention to these tasks , which require full and continuing commitment on the part of the member states to transpose and implement the european directives . 
all too often , the commission has promoted the introduction of new legislation and the creation of new spending programs rather than effective management of what is already in place . 
thus , mr barroso should forget the platitudes of the lisbon agenda and concentrate instead on the actual implementation of the single market and bring order to the fiscal policies of member states . 
it must be left to local governments take responsibility for the economic performance of their country . 
the emotional clash of civilisations 
throughout the so-called " war against terrorism , " the concept of " shock of civilization " between islam and the west has usually been excluded as politically incorrect and intellectually wrongheaded . 
the most common interpretation to place is that the world has entered a new era of conflict " within " particular civilization , namely islam , with fundamentalist muslims as much in war against moderates as against the west . 
the strategic conclusion derived from such an analysis was clear , ambitious and easily summarized : democratization . 
if the absence of democracy in the islamic world was the problem , bringing democracy to the " big " middle east would be the solution , and it was the historical duty of the united states , as the most powerful and moral nation , to provide the necessary change . 
the status quo was untenable . 
implementing democracy , with or without regime change , was the only alternative to chaos and the rise of fundamentalism . 
today , iraq may be on the brink of civil war between shiites and sunnis . 
iran , ruled by a new and more radical president , irresistibly , is heading towards obtaining a nuclear capability . 
a free electoral process brought hamas to power in palestine , and the unfortunate episode of the danish newspaper cartoons illustrated the almost combustible nature of relations between islam and the west . 
all these developments are paving the way to new interpretations . 
rather than a " clash of civilizations , " we could be facing many levels of conflict , which interact with them so that they increase global instability . 
indeed , it appears that the world is witnessing a triple conflict . 
there is a division within islam , which , if the violence in iraq is spreading to neighbouring countries , risk provoking regional destabilization . 
there is also a clash that should not be regarded as between islam and the west , but between the secular world and a growing religious world . 
in an even deeper and atavistic level , there is an emotional conflict between a culture of fear and a culture of humiliation . 
this would be a gross oversimplification to speak , as some do , a clash between civilization and barbarism . 
in fact , we are facing a widening divide on the role of religion , which runs between the west ( with the united states in the role of the complicated exception ) and most of the rest of the world ( the most notable exception being china ) , particularly the islamic world . 
the gap reflects how religion defines an individual 's identity within a society . 
at a time when religion is becoming increasingly important elsewhere , we europeans have largely forgotten our past religious ( violent and intolerant ) , and have difficulty understanding the role that religion can play in the daily lives of other people . 
in some ways , " they " are our own buried past and , in a combination of ignorance , prejudice , and by all , fear , " we " are afraid that " they " could define our future . 
we live in a secular world , where freedom of expression can easily turn into insensitive and irresponsible mockery , while others see religion as their supreme goal , if not their last hope . 
they have tried everything , from nationalism to regionalism , from communism to capitalism . 
since everything has failed , why not try god ? 
globalization may not have created these levels of conflicts , but it has accelerated them by making the differences more visible and palpable . 
in our globalized age , we have lost the privilege , and paradoxically , virtue , ignorance . 
we all see how others feel and react , but without the historical and cultural instruments necessary to decipher these responses . 
globalization has paved the way to a world dominated by the dictatorship of emotions and ignorance . 
this emotional clash is exacerbated in the case of islam . 
in the arab world , in particular , islam is dominated by a culture of humiliation felt by the people and nations who regard themselves as the main losers , the worst victims , of a new international system and unfair . 
from this point of view , the israeli-palestinian conflict is exemplary . 
it has become an obsession . 
this is not so much that arabs and muslims really care about the palestinians . 
on the contrary , the islamic world has left the palestinians without real support for decades . 
in reality , for them the conflict has come to symbolize the anachronistic perpetuation of an unfair colonial order , to represent their political malaise , and to embody the impossibility that they perceive to be masters of their fate . 
in arab eyes ( and some other muslims ) , the strength and resilience of israel is a direct consequence of their own weakness , divisions , and corruption . 
the majority of arabs may not support al-qaeda , but they do not oppose all their heart . 
instead , there is the temptation to treat osama bin laden as a kind of violent robin hood , whose actions , officially unforgivable , helped them recover a sense of arab pride and dignity . 
this is , perhaps , is the true clash of civilizations : the emotional conflict between the european culture of fear and the culture of the humiliation muslim , and more particularly arabic . 
it would be dangerous to underestimate the depth of so wide an emotional divide , and to recognize its existence is the first step to overcoming it . 
but it will be difficult , because transcend the emotional clash of civilizations presupposes an opening to the " other " that none of the two sides is perhaps ready to consider . 
globalisation and anti-americanism 
anti-american sentiments are everywhere in the world . 
american democrats say that president bush 's policies have damaged the attractiveness of america . 
republicans respond that america is bound to be resented the fact of its size and its association with globalisation . 
according to them , anti-americanism will persist because some people see america as a cultural threat . 
for my part , i think that these positions lack historical perspective . 
contrary to conventional wisdom , globalization is not a factor and homogenisation of americanization the cultures of the world . 
although the united states is at the forefront of the current information revolution , which enables us to develop the similarities of social and cultural habits ( such as television viewing or the use of the internet ) , which are attributed to americanization , even if the correlation is not causation . 
to understand why , imagine a country that introduced computers and communication with speed in a world where america did not exist . 
you would still expect to social and cultural changes of the importance of such modernization . 
of course , because of the existence of the us and their presence at the vanguard of the information revolution , there is a degree of americanization , which will diminish probably during the twenty-first century thanks to the technological penetration and modernisation of local cultures at their own pace . 
historical proof that globalization does not necessarily mean homogenisation lies in japan , a country that deliberately isolated from the rest of the world when the first waves of globalization . 
in the middle of the nineteenth century , japan became the first asian country to embrace globalization , and to borrow with success in the rest of the world without losing its uniqueness . 
during the meiji restoration , japan has sought everywhere the tools and innovations that would allow it to become a major power rather than a victim of western imperialism . 
it sent his youth studying in western societies . 
its delegations scoured the world looking for scientific innovations , technology , and industry . 
in the political field , meiji reformers were very aware of the philosophy and institutions , but they chose to turn to the german model because they were deemed more suitable to a country run by an emperor . 
the lesson that japan gives the rest of the world is not only to the fact that an asian country can be competitive , but that after a century and a half of globalization , it is possible to adapt while preserving a unique culture . 
above all , the image of america as a factor homogenisation reflects a mistakenly static view of cultures . 
the efforts to show local cultures as unchanging often reflect reactionary political strategies rather than a description of the reality . 
as the peruvian author mario vargas llosa , those who defend the cultural identities against globalization , betray a stagnant attitude towards culture seen outside of historical fact . 
do we know of a culture that have remained unchanged through time ? 
to find such crops , it must go to the meeting , primitive , magico-religious communities of people who ... the fact of their primitive condition , are still more vulnerable to exploitation and extermination . 
vibrant cultures are constantly transition , borrowing from other cultures without that borrowing is not always from the us . 
thus , a large number of countries turned to canada rather than the us as an example for their own constitution in the years following the end of the cold war . 
globalisation is also a two-edged sword . 
in some regions , is not only a backlash against american cultural imports , but some effort to change american culture itself . 
a majority of americans are probably agree with capital punishment of our days , but the death penalty is regarded as a flagrant violation of human rights everywhere in europe , in fact , almost everywhere in the world . 
the american positions on the environment and climate change or gmos raise the same criticism . 
more subtly , america 's openness to immigration enriches as well as it transforms american culture . 
finally , globalization and the information revolution may reinforce rather than reduce cultural diversity . 
some french commentators express fear in the world of internet global marketing , which would leave no room for a culture attached to hundreds of different types of cheese . 
on the contrary , the internet allows dispersed customers to come together in a way to encourage niche markets , and even hundreds of web sites dedicated exclusively to the cheese . 
the internet also allows people to establish a more diverse set of political communities . 
the use of welsh in britain and gaelic in ireland is more important now than it was half a century ago . 
britain , belgium and spain , among other european countries have given greater powers to the regions and the local elected officials . 
the global information age may strengthen rather than weaken local cultures . 
economic and social globalization product superficial similarities in t-shirt logos or soft drink brands , but there will always be a underlying cultural diversity . 
american culture dominates the world today , and it helps to the attractiveness of america , this is its soft power , in many areas , but not in all areas . 
at the same time , immigrants , the ideas and events outside the american borders changing american culture within the borders of the united states . 
as globalization spreads technological capabilities , information technology allows broader participation in global communications and the domination of the economy and the american culture may well diminish . 
less dominance may mean a little less anxiety about americanization , less protests against american arrogance , and less intensity in the anti-american backlash . 
the us may have less control in the future , but could find itself living in a world more compatible with its basic principles of democracy , free markets , individual freedoms and human rights . 
why america must join the world 
the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on new york and washington have profoundly changed the us by moving the order of priorities on foreign policy . 
the new national security strategy the bush administration , issued in september 2002 , identifies the combination of terrorism , rogue states , and weapons of mass destruction as the first threat to america . 
most people agree with the new direction taken by the american foreign policy , but debate the method used . 
the threat is so great that america must act alone , or should the us act only with the support of international institutions , even if that holds the country ? 
events in iraq illustrate this debate , but it has deeper roots . 
during his presidential campaign in 2000 , george w. bush said of america : " if we are an arrogant nation , they will see us as well , but if we are a nation humble , they 'll respect us . " 
he was right , but unfortunately many of america 's friends saw his administration , during the first eight months after his election , concern itself with arrogance limited interests of america , focused on military power , and dismissive of treaties , standards and multilateralism . 
the administration 's peremptory announcement that the kyoto protocol on global climate change was " dead " has led to a reaction from other countries that cost the us its seat on the human rights commission of the un . 
the september 11 , supposedly changed all that . 
congress has finally paid the debts owed by america to the un and the president has concentrated its efforts on the formation of a coalition against terrorism . 
but the rapid success of the war in afghanistan led some members of the administration and some commentators to conclude the good functioning of unilateralism . the columnist charles krauthammer , for example , calls for a " new unilateralism " in which america refuses to play the role of " docile international citizen " and unashamedly pursues its own objectives . 
the new unilateralists make a mistake in focusing too heavily on military power alone . 
it is true that america 's military power , supported by a budget equivalent to the eight countries combined after the united states , is essential to global stability , and plays a major role in the response to terrorism . 
but the metaphor of the war should not blind us to the fact that the removal of terrorism will require years of unspectacular civilian cooperation with other countries in areas such as the sharing of information , the work of police , the traceability of financial flows and the cooperation between the customs . 
military success in afghanistan has solved the easiest part of the problem . 
al qaeda retains cells in 15 countries . 
rather than demonstrate the unilateralists " point , the partial success in afghanistan illustrates the continuing need for cooperation . 
similarly , it was much easier to win the war in iraq than to win the peace . 
the problem for americans in the 21st century lies in the fact that a lot more important than ever to problems and of forces beyond the control of even the most powerful state . the attacks of september 11 demonstrated that the information revolution and globalization have changed the world policy so that the americans cannot achieve all their international goals acting alone . 
the us lacks both the international and domestic prerequisites to resolve conflicts own to other societies , and to monitor and control transnational transactions that threaten the americans in their country . 
in several of the key issues , such as international financial stability , drug smuggling , the spread of diseases , or global climate change , the military power is ineffective . 
indeed , its use can be self-defeating . 
america must instead mobilize international coalitions to deal with these threats and these common challenges . 
the willingness of others to cooperate depends in part on their own self-interest , but also the attractiveness of american positions . 
this soft power is what i call the " soft power . " 
this means that other countries want what you want , and the need to use the carrot and the stick to get others to do what you want is less now . 
hard power derives from the military and economic power of a country . 
the soft power is the product of the attractiveness by culture , the ideals and the policies of a country . 
hard power will always be essential , but soft power will become increasingly important in the treatment of transnational issues whose resolution requires multilateral cooperation . 
it is certain that no great country cannot afford to be strictly multilateralist , and sometimes the us must take the lead of other countries , as was the case in afghanistan . 
but in iraq , president bush would have had to follow the example of his father and form a broad international coalition . 
now , as his administration returns to the un to seek a new resolution that will enable other countries to contribute troops and resources for the maintenance of peace and reconstruction in iraq , he is paying the price for its method of entry into war . 
agree , multilateralism can be used by smaller states to restrict the freedom of action of america , but that does not mean that it is not generally in america 's interest . 
by integrating us policies in multilateral structures , the us can make their disproportionate power more legitimate and more acceptable . 
even well intentioned americans are not immune to the famous warning of lord acton which states that power tends to corrupt . 
learn to listen to others and to define us interests more broadly to include global interests will be crucial to american soft power , and the vision that will have the other countries of their preponderance ( healthy or not ) . 
the paradox of american power is that the largest power since rome cannot reach a large number of its objectives unilaterally in the global information age . 
america needs to pay more attention to soft power and multilateral cooperation . 
that is the real lesson of 11 september . 
socialism or global division ? 
for the first time in our history , we have the knowledge , the technology and the wealth to design a different world . 
we have the means to " send poverty in the dustbin of history " ( make poverty history ) . 
although we have the power to change the world , we do not take the necessary steps . 
in 2000 , many governments around the world have adopted under the auspices of the united nations the millennium development goals , which aim to halve poverty by 2015 . 
yet the international community has lacked the political will necessary to respond to these basic responsibilities to humanity , leading to a loss of confidence in the policy in the people . 
if we do nothing , our citizens will lose hope in the power of democracy and wallow in extremism , fundamentalism and violence . 
to restore the confidence of the people not only in politics but also by their own potential , our policies must ensure responsible governance and institutions that work responsibly in the interest of citizens . 
the socialist international , the largest political organization in the world , can unite the citizens of the world around a new global agenda to achieve these goals . 
our first challenge will be to democratize globalization . 
we must redefine the globalisation since the basis and include two thirds of humanity that are currently excluded from the process , on terms that reflect the socialist principles of inclusion , cultural diversity , and sustainable development . 
how can citizens have a democratic way to economic development when the imf and world bank work on the principle of " one dollar , a voice " ? 
democracy cannot flourish in a world where capital and power are heavily concentrated in the hands of a few , when the multinationals questioned the power of democratically elected representatives , when the crime can afford to buy police , justice and politicians , when monopolization of the media erodes the freedoms . 
the democratization of globalisation will take time . 
however , we can speed up the process by strengthening regional cooperation and integration . 
it calls for the creation of new channels of cooperation with progressive forces in other parts of the world , in china , the united states , india , and in the arab world . 
to respond to the global problems , we need to strengthen and democratize the international institutions , including the united nations . 
however , we must go beyond the reform of the security council and start creating a democratic global architecture to put globalisation at the service of citizens and not markets . 
today , the main priority for socialists is to restore the balance between economic productivity and social justice . 
while we have successful precedents , particularly the nordic model , it is difficult to achieve this balance in some countries . 
as capitalist markets not to vast commercial networks , and the market economies become market societies , governments and the trade unions are increasingly restricted in their freedom of action . 
this has paralyzed and divided our citizens . 
the citizens of the developed countries increasingly feel like mere objects of consumerism , while the citizens of developing countries are fighting for daily survival . 
in both cases , but in a different way , people feel impoverished . 
it is certain that we belong to different societies but we also have to deal with new forms of inequality . 
the lack of labor standards in some regions of the world undermines the social welfare workers from other parts of the world . 
mass migration from poor countries has fuelled feelings of fear and xenophobia in rich countries , particularly in the working class . 
similarly , free trade has turned farmers and employees of the service sector of developed and developing countries . 
environmental concerns have become the bed of the blame game . " 
developed countries fear the depletion of vital resources if they are shared with developing countries , which in turn blames the rich countries to destroy the environment in their race for profit . 
to fill these divisions , we need to rethink the nature of jobs in this global economy increasingly automated , borderless and mobile . 
the capital is globalizing , core labour standards should be global . 
the forced labour and the work of children , and discrimination in the workplace , must be abolished . 
we also need to democratise our own policies . 
we must fight against exclusion in our political parties , just as we fight exclusion in our societies . 
this means welcoming immigrants and minorities , creating more opportunities for women and the disabled , of empowering citizens through education and participation . 
empowering citizens means giving them the power to decide and the ability to decide in full knowledge of the case . 
pasok , the greek socialist party that i lead , we have undertaken far-reaching reforms in this direction . 
it is even within the socialist international , which seeks to create a world governed not by free markets , but by free people . 
the hare chinese and indian the turtle 
" india is everywhere " was the theme of this year 's world economic forum . 
in the western world , a great importance is attached to the achievements of china so that those of india will come to an afterthought . 
to underline the fact that political stability must triumph in the long term , the indians have covered all swiss buses of the banner " india , the emerging democracy fastest in the world . " 
the indian media blitz was a huge success . 
in davos , speakers have included the idea that even if china is currently the rope , over the long term , the race between the two asian giants will play at the toss . 
at least for a few days , india 's emergence as a superpower , compared to china , was a fait accompli . 
but what is really happening in the race between those two economies which relate to more than a billion people each ? 
in appearance , china has a comfortable lead on india . 
twenty-five years ago , at the dawn of the current movement of globalization , national output in india and china was about the same . 
now , whatever the economic indicators , china is twice as rich as india . 
but the real difference is not so much that the best chinese are doing better than the best indians . 
the indian elite champions . the bold $ 22 billion proposed by lakshmi mittal for french steelmaker arcelor shows . 
the real difference -- that we admit it or not -- is the fact that china 's communist government has managed to globalise a larger portion of the population that india 's democratic government has managed to do . 
however , it is impossible to say that the wealth to be equitably distributed in china . 
it is only along the coast , home to roughly a third of the chinese population , that people seem to really be returned in the 21st century . 
the bulk of rural china is still very poor and 150 million rural chinese have no employment . in the countryside , health and education often remind us that the past centuries . 
however , the figures of exclusion caste system are even worse in india . 
it could be that only one in five will take advantage of the global economy . 
for an employee in the call center employee , there are countless indians who are only eke out a living . 
while some 450 million chinese are participating in the globalization of the economy , only 200 to 250 million indians benefit . 
more than anything else , this is the difference between the two economies . 
that can make india to fill the gap ? 
his biggest flaw is the lack of roads , bridges , ports and other infrastructure . at this level , the contrast with china is striking . 
if your products can not access to the global market , you cannot conquer it ? 
over the past five years , china has quintupled its road infrastructure . 
its 50 000 kilometres of new roads have been built to accommodate larger aircraft , which is common with certain avenues 's shambolic airports . 
this is not only a question of money : the cash flows to the central bank of india has mainly invested in foreign treasury bills low yield . 
the real problem is that china 's authoritarian system does not meet opposition when it decides to bulldoze a shantytown that stands in the way of a new airport . 
the indian government , by contrast , has neither power nor the will to walk on poor people to enrich people richer . 
unfortunately , without infrastructure , the 800 million indians who have not yet succeeded in life have little chance of getting there . 
india will never be able to create enough jobs in the services sector , it must be able to compete in the manufacture of low-end products . 
without better infrastructure , the majority of indians will remain frozen out of globalization . 
thus , the indian economy could overtake china 's hopeless romanticism ? 
not necessarily . the areas in which india excels , essentially services , have far higher potential margins that industrial production . 
on this point , the chinese , disabled by a vastly inferior legal system , it will be difficult to be competitive . 
western companies are more confidence in the indian companies , in terms of sensitive financial information or patents , as they do in china . 
foreign companies know that if they outsourcing to china , they might as well publish directly their projects on the web . 
india also has a financial system much more developed than china , an advantage increasingly important as the two countries develop . 
the command and control of finance ( the directed lending , such as economists call it ) are effective when it comes to build bridges . they are much less when it must choose the companies deserve to be saved . 
the challenge for the indians , as for the other emerging economies ( brazil , russia and mexico ) is to find new methods to amplify their economic sectors that without strangling them . 
if india managed to catch up with china , it should include a greater number of its citizens by offering them a better provision of health , education and infrastructure . 
this is only the price that " india everywhere . " 
the g8 in countries of the black gold 
poor oil-rich russia . 
it is trying so hard to find its place in the elite group of eight countries taken seriously . 
president vladimir putin , perhaps hoping to elevate the debate at the presidential summit in st. petersburg in july , has laid out an ambitious agenda . 
he plans to lead his colleagues in erudite conversations about education , infectious diseases and , to be sure that no one dozes off , " energy security " . 
and that has putin gotten for his efforts ? 
not much . 
the bush administration , represented by vice president dick cheney ( but with the explicit approval of the boss ) has recently accused russia of backsliding in its old " evil empire " ways . 
putin shot back , portraying the united states to " comrade wolf , " ready to pounce on any nation showing signs of weakness . 
how bush and putin will be welcome at the meeting in st. petersburg ? the suspense . 
the europeans , for their part , are always on the verge of nerves , so great is their fear of becoming again trapped gas dispute between russia and ukraine that has their pipelines dry for a few days at the beginning of the year . 
for them , talk about " energy security " with russia is to talk about the safety of the water with comrade crocodile . 
of course , if you want to be unkind will point out the absurdity of russia 's membership to a club that includes the giant economies of the united states , germany , japan , england , france , italy , and ( to a lesser extent ) canada . 
why chinese president hu jintao , whose country has the world 's second largest economy ( measured by the world prices ) , he was not given the place of putin around the table ? 
after all , even with all its energy resources , and despite the current surge in gas and oil prices , russia 's national income is little more than that of greater los angeles . 
perhaps putin stop to collect all these criticisms and go on the offensive . 
he could start by pointing out to his democratic counterparts if enough that it is probably more popular in russia that none of them in his own country . 
in fact , it could probably win a fair election tomorrow ( no risk that it knows a day that said ) . 
rare are the leaders who could without laughing . 
of course , putin 's success over the last few years in the elimination of any semblance of a free press ( and when an ex-kgb man " eliminates " free press , it is not just a figure of speech ) has contributed to mute open opposition . 
that does not , however , prevent putin to enjoy a real popularity among a public request a leader able to bind the country without the sink . 
putin might also argue that the fiscal position of his country is much more robust than those of other members of the g8 . 
of course , the fact that siberia turned out to be a giant oil well , with the government absorbs most of the money . 
venezuelan president hugo chavez is also balancing the books of his country , for the moment . 
but to be honest , oil is not everything . 
most economists advocate rich countries to replace their old tax codes complicated by a simple and low , to single rate , and bemoan the fact that so few countries have tried it . 
putin , however , has put in place this style of politics a few years ago , and the results have been nothing short of miraculous . 
of course , it is possible that the other g8 leaders are less enamored of some in the area of the resolution budget problems . 
most g8 countries seem unable to achieve the political consensus needed to take the necessary measures , such as raising the retirement age or significantly cutting the indexation allowances on inflation . 
russia has virtually abandoned its pensioners having increased the amount of their income . 
in reality , many elderly russians are forced to ensure their livelihoods to grow potatoes on the tiny plots of land that the government allows them to grow . 
that is , if they survive : since the fall of the berlin wall , life expectancy for men dropped to 65 years to around 60 years . 
it seems that the stress of transition is the leading cause of death , even before the major killers in postcommunist russia such as alcohol , crime and aids . 
should putin tell his colleagues that they too could balance the intergenerational account of their country by starving the elderly ? 
in fact , putin would no doubt be well advised not to overstate the successes of his country . 
perhaps it is better to leave the vodka flow and hope for a round of smiles on the family photo . 
nevertheless , when putin tells his guests that they must pay russia more to increase their own " energy security " , it may finally get the respect that he craves . 
the economy of fear 
the global economy seems to be walking on water , a shrug of the shoulders of rising oil prices , the political paralysis in europe , the unsustainable deficit of the united states and the record prices of real estate . 
is it because , as would have us believe the leaders of the g8 , investors are optimistic , confident in the direction given to the world economy by their leaders ? 
or are we being governed by a pathology of fear , fed by events such as the recent terrorist attacks in london , which maintains long-term interest rates low , masking a host of simmering problems ? 
the role of long-term interest rates , extremely low ( after adjustment for inflation ) , who hides a multitude of weaknesses in the global economy is all too apparent . 
rising house prices around the world supports the demand in many countries , and , according to a recent study of the international monetary fund , the interest rates falling continues explain two-thirds or more of the global price rise . 
europe has benefited less , but its economies would be far worse if long-term interest rates climbed back to their average it was 25 years ago . 
similarly , latin america has been booming in recent years , despite the weight of debt and a political reform mixed . 
the weak long-term interest rates have allowed the region to manage its debt , while the demand has helped push up the price of exports of commodities in the region . 
why the surge in oil prices has not only put the world to its knees , as was so often the case in the past ? 
once again , the answer lies in the low interest rates . 
usually , a sharp rise in oil prices quickly translates into higher inflation expectations , followed by rising interest rates at all maturities . 
but this time the us federal reserve keeps hiking its short-term lending rate to control inflation and long-term interest rates , which are far more important , have declined , as if by magic . 
indeed , america is the single biggest beneficiary of this low interest rates , where everyone borrows money as if soon there would be more nowhere . 
homeowners , backed by the rise of home prices , mounting debts . 
the federal government has thrown fiscal prudence out the window . 
the country as a whole is absorbing an incredible three-quarters of global savings . 
but , as long as interest rates remain low and high growth , americans can laugh at those predictions that their excesses fruit of ruin . 
but if the weak long-term interest rates help so many economies walk on water , why are rates so low and this situation will it continue ? 
perhaps the situation is far more fragile than many politicians would have us believe . 
people feel perhaps less , not more , security about their long-term future , either because they fear terrorism , a global pandemic , or a severe rash of financial crises . 
i am not saying that investors are hysterical , but simply that they have become a little more concerned about the long-term outlook . 
therefore , they are throwing themselves on the actions and borrowing securities they receive , rightly or wrongly , as safe . 
we lack other explanations . 
it is certain that emerging markets have been in an unusual savings spree , rebuilding reserves and improving their balance sheets , but nobody expects that to continue indefinitely . 
even the director of the us federal reserve , alan greenspan , the oracle of delphi on interest rates , says about the current situation that it is a " conundrum . " 
history suggests that the technology boom has yet to play its role , and with productivity gains americans prepared to irradiating the world , raising the rate of growth everywhere . 
usually , a rapid global growth translates into higher interest rate for the long term , unless , of course , at the bottom , people have become worried . 
suppose that investors are worried about the possibility of disaster in the five to ten years . 
( according to experts on nuclear terrorism and pandemics , the risk is real . ) 
suppose that investors believe that growth will probably continue to be strong , but that maybe -- just maybe -- the situation will fall apart . 
in this case , it is entirely possible to low interest rates co-exist with strong growth . 
it is true that some economists point to the happy days of the 1950s and early 1960s , when europe , the united states and japan prospered , but interest rates generally remained well below the rate of economic growth . 
this time representing the golden age of global growth , why worry if we live the same phenomenon today ? 
what the optimists forget is that these years were paradise also a period of uncertainty . 
many were those who feared , in reality , the outbreak of world war iii , and rightly so , according to many historians . 
back then , the specter of the apocalypse helped keep the loans at a rate affordable . 
fortunately , the worst fears of investors are not carried out , and we can only hope today the same thing . 
but if insecurity is one of the main reasons why interest rates are low , then g-8 leaders should be less quick to congratulate themselves . 
the fragility of the collective psychology investors is known . 
if they are moderating a day , interest rates will rise more beautiful , and it could well lead to simmering imbalances in the global economy . 
political upheaval in israel 
israeli politics is experiencing its most dramatic changes in 30 years . 
the realignment of parties and leaders is particularly remarkable because the unexpected nature of recent events in date : ariel sharon 's decision to leave the likud , the defeat of shimon peres as leader of the labour party and the withdrawal of labour sharon 's grand coalition government . 
it is more important to comprehend the significance of these changes for the future of israel , the region , and the arab-israeli conflict . 
in short , israel 's political system is approaching the end of its second era . 
the independence in 1948 until 1977 , the labour party has dominated , before giving way to an opposition coalition of conservative , nationalist , and centrist parties allies in the likud bloc . 
since then , the two parties have alternated in power , sometimes in grand coalitions and sometimes in partnership with smaller parties . 
on the surface , the rivalry between the parties has been between " left " and " right , " or " hawks " and " doves . " 
the truth , of course , is more complex . 
the classes and the economic problems , in the shadow of more existential concerns , such as the physical security and the continued existence of the state , have played a much less important role in israel than in other societies . 
here , the political divide could be defined as " optimists " and " pessimistic " . 
the first , labour , believed that one day a force would emerge among arabs and palestinians ready to make peace on a reasonable basis , while the latter , likud , were more cautious . 
for years , the discussion has remained an abstraction , a debate over what might happen in the future , until the oslo accords with the plo in 1993 put to the test the rival visions . 
since 2000 , when plo leader yasser arafat rejected a political agreement and instead launched a five-year war of terrorism , there is little optimistic . 
the subsequent intellectual realignment in israel has given birth to a new national consensus . 
it is now widely accepted that , as the left has always insisted , israel should be ready to withdraw from the west bank and gaza strip and to accept the existence of a palestinian state in exchange for real peace . 
but it is also accepted that , as the right has always maintained , there is no partner really ready to make peace . 
in this context , sharon has won two landslide election victories as a radical while a moderate policy , including a full withdrawal from the gaza strip . 
this is where israel today , facing a political upheaval fueled by two new elements . 
first , sharon moved the likud in the centre , and made the hegemonic party , while destroying all the stereotypes about his personality , his methods and his vision of the world . 
yet this is for the same reason that a lot of likud members consider sharon , who helped found the party , as a traitor . 
sharon now needs to institutionalize his reforms , even if it must establish another party to this . 
secondly , the labour party has demonstrated its bankruptcy policy , because its only conceivable leader was a shimon peres age 82 and its anachronistic optimism of dove was ridiculed . 
as a result , and thanks to a low turnout in the elections , the party primaries have been won by amir peretz , an outsider and populist who wants to revitalize the labour party in highlighting the social and economic problems , which means the withdrawal of the national unity coalition with likud . 
although it should form a new party , sharon will probably win the next election , he has planned for february . 
peretz 's strategy may draw voters from other parties of the left , but labor will surely lose centrist voters ( and those for whom national security is a priority ) to sharon . 
paradoxically , all this will have a great deal in principle and perhaps very modest in practice . 
while sharon enjoying a strong public support for a moderate policy , israel will be more ready than ever to reach an agreement with the palestinians , syria , and the arab world in general in order to find a comprehensive diplomatic solution to the conflict . 
yet , given the chaos and the paralysis that increasingly characterize palestinian politics , this opportunity will not be seized . 
the growing power of hamas , which openly proclaims its strategy to increase the acts of terrorism and destroying israel , reinforces that this trend . 
the same can be said of syria , whose hardline government turns to a dangerously adventurous militancy . 
sharon might decide on partial withdrawals and dismantling of settlements in the west bank . 
but it is now widely accepted that such changes are a response to dim prospects of real progress toward peace . 
clinging to the territories as a bargaining chip makes less sense if there is no one with whom to haggle . 
instead , israel will continue to prioritize its own security , strengthening its defenses against terrorism and consolidating its control over the relatively small portions of the west bank that it intends to claim as part of a possible diplomatic settlement . 
a byproduct of this strategy , combined with the palestinian attacks , sympathy has been growing international against israel . 
this phenomenon could continue if the current political realignment has occurred , enabling sharon to win its programme the centre and even the moderate left . 
nothing is assured , of course . 
benjamin netanyahu , who remains popular , may very well become a powerful rival to his right , and peretz might of the labour party into a serious contender to his left . 
in any case , the national consensus has changed , shaking all convictions in israeli politics . 
the february elections will put these assumptions to their toughest test in decades .

ensure the future at the summit in evian 
the paradox of our time is that the world 's richest countries have the power to do good , but they seem to feel obliged to miss all the opportunities open to them in that direction . 
the united states as the supreme example of : a country that spends $ 450 billion per year to its defence budget and allocates only $ 12 billion per year to development assistance for poor countries . 
they can bomb somalia , afghanistan and iraq , but they seem to poorly equipped to help these regions to develop . 
europe is not better , paralyzed as it is by internal divisions and budget deficits . 
at the g8 summit , which will be held next week in evian , france will have a chance to make a new start . 
for the one billion people represented at the g8 summit , life is pleasantly compared to the rest of the planet , with average incomes of 25 000 dollars per person and a life expectancy of around 80 years . 
for about three billion people in the world today , including china , the bulk of india and east asia , the economic development continues relatively well , even if it displays a lot of ups and downs ( most recently , the shock of the sars epidemic ) . 
the trends are also seen in brazil and mexico . 
but for the remaining two billion people , life is desperate . 
for about a billion of them , their survival is precarious . 
millions of people die each year because they lack access to medicines , food , clean drinking water and basic sanitation . 
their life expectancy is often less than 50 years , and is falling in many regions . 
the g-8 could end the suffering billions of people the poorest in the world if it adopted realistic measures to solve their problems . 
it does not only because they are greedy , but also because they are scared . 
they think that global poverty is inevitable and too expensive to eradicate . 
but it can solve the problems of the world 's poorest , with relatively little effort and without noticeable negative impact on its own level of life . 
the biggest problem areas are concentrated in sub-saharan africa , the andean region and central asia . 
other pockets of extreme poverty in china and india are on the path to the improvement thanks to rapid economic growth of these two giants . 
but the problems in sub-saharan africa , the andes and central asia are not solving themselves . 
these regions are trapped in poverty . 
africa is by far the most affected . 
the us government believes that these countries can only themselves to blame if they are poor . 
but it is the ignorant boasting a rich country that does not understand the situation on the ground . 
africa is trapped in poverty for deep-seated reasons . 
she suffers from endemic malaria , which looks like an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome that lasts for centuries , not for a few months . 
it suffers from a climate prone to massive droughts and soil which the nutrients . 
it suffers from the fact that the bulk of its people live in rural areas , without paved roads to reach the ports and to facilitate access to international trade . 
aside from a few countries in west africa , it suffers from a serious shortage of energy resources ( coal , oil or hydroelectric power . 
the united states never had to grapple with the problems of the scale of those occurring in africa . 
ultimate irony , these serious problems can be solved , whatever the cost . 
it is here that the g8 should intervene . 
the only commitment that must take the g8 leaders at evian , to follow through on their previous promises that have not been held for years . 
over the past three years , world leaders have promised to take concrete measures to reduce global poverty by half by the year 2015 , in a series of commitments known as the millennium development goals . 
but only small steps have been taken . 
the united states have increased aid to $ 4 billion per year , when they increased military spending $ 150 billion per year and cut taxes of trillions of dollars . 
it is clear that the us has the means to do more to a very large scale to help poor countries of the world , if only they had the foresight . 
the g8 leaders must commit precisely to provide financial aid adapted to the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria , to increase food productivity in africa through a new green revolution , to ensure that all the poor children can be in school , and that all the poor peoples of all the countries to have access to clean drinking water and sanitation . 
the total cost of this problem would be remarkably below 1 % of the annual income of rich countries . 
for the first time in history , the rich are so rich and the poor so poor that a tiny effort by the rich could end massive suffering . 
the summit in evian will clarify whether greed , ignorance and the bombast of the war have completely closed the eyes of the united states and europe and japan will look inward rather than outward . 
good reasons to slow population growth 
the global talks on the demographic policies are confusing . 
one side argues that the growth in human population threatens our environment and our prosperity . 
the earth , water , energy and biodiversity all seem to be greater stress than ever , and the population growth of seems to be responsible in large part . 
the other side of the debate , mainly in rich countries , door on households and the small number of children they have , insufficient to care for aging parents . 
those who worry about population growth have the better arguments . 
the questions that europe , japan , and to a lesser extent the united states and some middle-income countries must face in terms of ageing population are manageable . 
moreover , the benefits of a slowdown of population growth offset the costs of adjustment . 
by contrast , if global populations continue to grow rapidly , the pressure on the world 's resources will worsen . 
governments should therefore refrain to put in place of birth policies , even where birth rates are low . 
the confusion of the public debate in part reflects various demographic trends in different regions of the world . 
the fastest population growth occurs in the poorest regions . 
poor people , especially the agricultural populations , tend to have a greater number of children ( often up to six per woman ) , and therefore the highest rates of population growth . 
the families of poor farmers rely on their children for the chores of the firm and the safety of parents when they are old . 
poor families lack access to contraception and family planning . 
finally , poor families have many children like to ensure against the strong mortality . 
the fact of high fertility rates in africa , the united nations population division provides the doubling of the african population in 2050 passage of 900 million today to 1,8 billion . 
rapidly growing populations are also young populations , because of the large number of children per household . 
in africa , the average age today is 19 years and is projected to rise to around 28 years in 2050 . 
in europe , the trends are reversed . 
the united nations population decline to around 630 million in 2050 , against 725 million today . 
with fewer children and longer life expectancy , the average age of the population rises sharply in these forecasts , from 39 years in 2005 to 48 years in 2050 . 
for the whole world , population is expected to continue to grow 2,5 billion between 2005 and 2050 . 
all of that growth will be in the developing world : 1,3 billion more in asia , 900 million more in africa , and the rest in latin america and other regions . 
increase the global population of 2,5 billion human beings will increase the pressure not only on societies where population growth , but on the whole of the planet . 
overall energy consumption is soaring , reflecting the combined effect of rising per capita incomes ( and therefore the increase in energy consumption per capita ) and the people . 
the higher energy use is already changing our climate so dangerous . 
in addition , the tensions created by the global population growth combined with income growth , lead to a rapid deforestation , depletion of fisheries , land degradation and loss of habitat and extinction for a large number of animal and plant species . 
population growth in developing regions , particularly in africa , india and other parts of asia , must slow down . 
public policies can play an important role in improving the services of access to family planning for the poor , expanding social systems , reducing infant mortality through investments in public health and improving education and access to employment of women . 
a part of the european public , noting the decline of european populations that threat , wants to take the opposite approach and promote the return to larger families . 
that would be a mistake . 
the defenders of a demographic growth accelerated in europe are concerned about the lack of labor young to public pensions . 
but this concern can be managed today by savings from the young and middle-aged preparing their retirement and working beyond the age of 65 . 
these workers will reap major benefits if they live in societies with stable or gradually declining populations . 
direct household expenditures to the education of children will be less important . 
they will also save in investments linked to infrastructure such as new roads , power plants , schools and other public services . 
they will enjoy less congested cities and less pressure on the environment to the campaign . 
the european economies will have less costs in limiting greenhouse gases caused by the consumption of energy , which will lead to a more effective control of climate change . 
in short , the quality of life will improve with the decline of the european population in the years to come . 
there is nothing radical in calling for slower population growth . 
for tens of thousands of years , the human population has tended to rise and fall without really show a long-term trend . 
it is only in the past two centuries , with the rise of modern economic life that the world 's population soar , from around one billion people in 1820 to 6,3 billion today and 9 billion by 2050 . 
this explosive growth was made possible thanks to the huge advances in science and technology . 
but this unprecedented growth has also put our planet to the test . 
we should intensify our efforts to slow population growth of voluntary means , and we should recognize that the stabilisation of the world 's population would now a more to human happiness and strengthen the sustainability of the environment for the future . 
foreign investors are still welcome ? 
the world flows of foreign direct investment ( fdi ) have soared over the last 20 years , from $ 40 billion in the early 1980s to 900 billion dollars last year . 
the cumulative stock of fdi has reached nearly $ 10 trillion , which is the most important mechanism delivery of goods and services to foreign markets : sales by foreign affiliates total roughly $ 19 trillion , compared to world exports of $ 11 trillion . 
at the same time , the liberalisation of fdi regimes by virtually all countries is a major force for trade between companies , the lifeblood of the emerging system of integrated international production and already about a third of global trade . 
but this beautiful times coming to an end ? 
fdi can bring many benefits , it has also sometimes costs . 
in the 1970s , when the transnational corporations ( tnc 's ) that such investment have begun to point out , many governments have believed that the costs of fdi outweighed their profits and so they controlled . 
the pendulum , held by developed countries , began to swing in the 1980s . 
once viewed as part of the problem , fdi became part of the solution to economic growth and development . 
nothing illustrates that better than changes in national fdi regimes . 
as reports the united nations conference on trade and development , among the 2 156 changes that took place between 1991 and 2004 , 93 % were to create a more hospitable environment for tnc 's . 
but the risk that the pendulum to swing back is real , leading to a reversal of this liberalisation process . 
fdi in developed countries ( and increasingly in emerging markets ) often takes the form of cross-border mergers and acquisitions . 
the resistance to such steps is becoming more frequent when they involve companies that politicians regard as " national champions " or that play a role in national security , economic development or cultural identity . 
the growing involvement of private equity firms in the activities of mergers and acquisitions raises other controversies , because such transactions are typically considered purely speculative . 
on behalf of " economic patriotism , " security and other considerations , resistance to mergers and acquisitions is codified in a growing number of countries . 
for example , a united states senate committee recently tried to block the project liberalization of foreign takeover rules for the airlines , and europe has put in place more restrictive takeover laws . 
in addition , governments are applying more strictly existing regulatory provisions concerning the control of takeovers by foreign firms . 
this response is linked to a defensive reaction to the growing role of tnc 's from emerging markets , " small news . " 
tnc 's already well established , and their countries of origin , will have to adapt to this new constellation of forces and its implications for the global market . 
as we know from other contexts , it is not easy to adapt to new : compare , for example , the reaction by the rapprochement between france 's alcatel and lucent of the us to bid by china national offshore oil corporation for chevron or mittal for acelor . 
another type of defensive reaction , this time to outward fdi , could well arise when the relocation of services gathers speed . 
all indications are that offshoring has reached a threshold , and that it is a phenomenon that will speed up through the fdi . 
if the countries of origin are not in place of adjustment mechanisms to adapt to the rapid revolution which makes negotiable the jobs of the services sector , a backlash against such outward fdi will be inevitable . 
the growing unease with fdi is now largely confined to developed countries . 
but there are signs that it extends to emerging markets . 
in the case of large-scale projects , some host countries raise questions about the contracts that define their relationship with tnc 's , and governments are reviewing such contracts because they believe ( rightly or wrongly ) that they have not received a fair deal . 
of the 219 known international arbitration cases concerning investment projects , some two thirds were initiated during the past three years . 
the approaches of fdi have changed in the past , and they can change again in the future , depending on how governments view the balance of costs and benefits . 
this balance involves not only economic factors , but also such considerations as security and the desire to control the economic development of a country . 
the concept of " nationalisation of the 21st century , " introduced by the peruvian candidate the presidential ollanta humala , reflects the " economic patriotism " of french prime minister dominique de villepin . 
the reservations against fdi ( as for everything that is alien ) can be found in all groups of countries , and when politicians are at the forefront protectionism is not far . 
however , it is ironic that the developed countries , which have led the fdi liberalization wave of the past 20 years , launch a movement opposite . 
let us hope that the de-liberalization seen in developed countries can be checked before it spread to other parts of the world and undesirable consequences for all . 
the culture of energy 
from global warming to instability in oil prices , everything indicates that a global energy crisis seems about to happen . 
to meet this challenge , humanity can no longer afford to ignore the inexhaustible resource of organic material that the sun provides each day through photosynthesis . 
solar energy enables plants absorb carbon and thereby produce not only oxygen , but also matter that the animal kingdom uses for food , and that our machines can use to obtain energy . 
since the neolithic , humans cultivate this biomass to feed itself . 
in our times its energy potential is ignored . 
from the industrial revolution , humans sought energy from coal , and later in oil and natural gas , which led to the depletion of resources that are not renewable . 
the alternatives to diversify energy production are limited . 
nuclear energy presents a number of drawbacks , especially in terms of safety and radioactive waste . 
hydroelectric power is already widely used , as wind and solar energy , they are structurally sporadic and available unevenly . 
biomass , on the other hand , has several advantages . 
it is widespread , in large quantities , in the world . 
in addition , has long been mastered the technology necessary to convert it into energy , including high-yield burning , gasification and liquefaction into synthetic fuel . 
this technology widely used during the second world war , has experienced considerable progress since . 
biomass energy , however , is the victim of unfair competition from fossil fuels . 
oil prices reflect its extraction , refining and distribution costs , but not those of the creation of the raw material . 
millions of years and 200 tonnes of plants are needed to produce a litre of oil , so that it does not need 15 kg of plant material to produce a litre of synthetic fuel . 
when the oil glut , with at least $ 20 a barrel , the attractiveness of the development of renewable energy from biomass has reduced and has more interested " green " militants and those interested in fundamental science . 
yet the potential is huge . 
the biomass of the planet : the forests , grasslands , the savanna lands and cultures , are a productive capital that generates a " return " 10 % each year . 
the image of a battery that empties and is then recharged by the sun , this energy is renewable indefinitely , as long as it is properly managed . 
the annual return on this capital is currently estimated at 60 billion tonnes , yet only two billion tonnes are eaten for food and 10 billion tonnes for energy purposes . 
increasing the responsible use of this energy source would contribute to the fight against climate change by reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and diminishing the amount of fossil fuel required to produce energy . 
in addition , its abundance in the countries of the south promises to facilitate their economic development . 
regarded as " energy of the poor " until today , biomass could become a source of wealth if it is grown and used with the support of the international community . 
thus , " energy crops " could be developed to produce biofuel . 
the residue from forest , agricultural , and agro-industrial activities could be collected and converted . 
the six million tonnes of waste each year by niger could theoretically be used to fully meet the energy needs of this country . 
energy cropping would certainly compete with food crops in many countries . 
long-term estimates project that by 50 years , most of the planet 's arable land should be used to produce food and for the protection of forest resources . 
therefore , areas dedicated to energy production , including biofuels , may not reach the desired level by companies . 
but , while such competition reveals new global shortages , it would also bring higher prices , thereby encouraging producers to increase yields and productivity . 
admittedly the energy culture would create new constraints , but it would also open new possibilities for many economic actors . 
the farmer and the forestry manager could invest in the market , the minor focus to cultures , the banker to the assets plants , etc . 
it is necessary to implement new policies , in the north and south , in terms of agriculture , management of water and earth , protection of biodiversity , taxation of fuels , information and public awareness , to prepare for an increase of energy crops . 
the ancient egyptians and the incas practiced the worship of the sun , because they thought he was at the root of all life on earth . 
science has given them reason since . 
today , when it has become more important than ever to use renewable resources , we should use the sun to cultivate our energy , just as our ancestors did for their food . 
the culture of the creation of company 
the governments of the world want to encourage the creation of businesses . 
even though many start-ups , will never amount to much , each small company is an experiment , and it takes a lot to give birth to one likely to transform the economy of a nation , or even just to acquire an international dimension . 
in short , entrepreneurship is an incubator , also essential to long-term economic success . 
nowadays , to explain the differences in terms of creation of businesses from one country to another , we are looking at differences in national attitudes and policies . 
but there are also big differences within the country . 
the inhabitants of shanghai are said to be more entrepreneurial this point of view that those in beijing . 
the inhabitants of the ukrainian town of kherson are more than those of kiev . 
in a recent study , mariassunta giannetti and andrei simonov of the stockholm school of economics , have shown the magnitude of differences in the area of the creation of businesses in the swedish cities . 
they define entrepreneurs as people who say the resources from companies they control and in which they work at least part-time , and find that the proportion of business leaders in the population differs substantially in the 289 cities that they studied , ranging from 1,5 % to 18,5 % . 
that these differences tell us about the real causes of entrepreneurship ? 
the policy changes at the national level cannot account for the variation gianetti and simonov found . 
in the 1980s and early 1990s , the central agreements on the thresholds were dissolved and the swedish government has decreased income taxes and businesses . 
as a result , the number of creation of companies has doubled in the country , but the response was very different from one city to the other . 
why ? 
cultural variables seem to take a lot : half of the variation is to the account of the religion and the municipal politics . 
the cities are more entrepreneurs when they have a large proportion of pensioners were members of the church of sweden ( the official state church until 2000 ) and an electorate of right-wing . 
in addition , there is a phenomenon of rebound : cities with more entrepreneurs tend to create even more . 
once an entrepreneurial culture takes root , it extends to measure that people know of advantage on the business world and begin to feel attracted -- even if the benefits are not immediately palpable . 
indeed , giannetti and simonov have found that the average income of ceos is lower in the cities with the most of entrepreneurship in those who are less . 
in the same way , studies from other countries show that entrepreneurs often less initially and see their income increase less quickly than if they had been employees . 
these studies suggest that the differences in terms of creating businesses are perhaps less due to better economic opportunities ( the " supply " side of the equation of entrepreneurship ) than to cultural differences that make the creation of more rewarding company from a personal point of view ( the " demand " ) . 
this assumption is by giannetti and simonov , who argue that differences in the prestige of entrepreneurs in the various cities can justify the disparities . 
in some municipalities , the heads of companies enjoy high social status , whether they are successful or not ; they are not considered and other activities are more admired . 
the idea that the prestige is important is not new . 
in his book the moral and money , the sociologist mich√®le lamont compared the definitions of success in france and the united states . 
it calls on the inhabitants of the two countries what it means to be a " worthy person . " 
in fact , it is consulting on what they consider important in life and their own personal sense of identity . 
lamont 's study confirmed the conventional wisdom for the americans , business success , while the french place all culture and quality of life . 
in the same way , open contempt of businessmen " money-hungry " and competition is expressed more often in france than in america . 
but , while lamont focuses on differences between the french and the americans , the most interesting of his research is the significant differences between various french regions . 
it compares clermont-ferrand , the capital of auvergne , in the center of france , and paris . 
auvergne 's inhabitants have a reputation for thrift and rigour , and despite recent progress very consistent , of relative shortage cultural . 
lamont has found that both in paris that clermont-ferrand tended to contempt for greed . 
in contrast , clermont-ferrand believe simplicity , pragmatism , the work , and the desire , while the parisians put more stress on the force and the talent . 
it concludes that , in many aspects , clermont-ferrand are closer to the hoosiers ( as the people of the us state of indiana , in the midwest ) that parisians . 
his research suggests that in clermont-ferrand , intrinsic demand creation of companies is stronger in paris . 
almost all countries are pastiche of local cultures that differ in their way to motivate people and shape their identity . 
the differences in how these cultures define what it means to be a person of value , and how this value is , probably explain much of the variation in levels of entrepreneurship . 
economists are not the only ones to consider often the country as a whole and appoint the attitudes and national policies as the main factors of encouragement or discouraging the creation of businesses . 
but , in fact , the national success in this field depends on the evolution of local cultures and their interaction with national policies . 
the enthusiasm for the creation of company can take root in culturally congenial regions of any country , once lifted economic constraints it are lifted , then acquire national importance in fed himself . 
university investments 
yale university , where i am a teacher , entrusts its endowment portfolio to one person , david swensen , for more than 20 years . 
during this period , the portfolio has grown from just over $ 1 billion to $ 18 billion , or an average yield of more than 16 % per year , which is the highest of any major universities . 
and it shows no sign of weakness ; during the last fiscal year ending in june , the return was 22,9 % . 
if the presidents of yale have come and gone , swensen rest . 
he has done more for the university that any president , or anyone else . 
in a university , ideas count more than money , but 18 billion dollars can create an environment for many new ideas . 
with 11 500 students , that is more 1,5 million dollars by student ( not including the buildings of the university or its art collection , which are worth several billion dollars each ) . 
how could this be possible ? 
how did swensen make so much money ? 
everyone is wondering -- especially we at yale . 
indeed , many here teach the " efficient markets hypothesis , which claims that financial markets around the world have become so competitive that it is impossible to get a return on investment is higher than normal . 
anyone who beats the market has just a stroke of luck . 
studies seem to confirm this . 
for example , a 2004 study by brad barber and terrance odean of the university of california , yi-tsung lee and yiu-jane liu of the national chengchi university , has collected data transaction on individual day traders of the taiwan stock exchange . 
the study revealed that only 1 % of day traders made a profit -- after deducting transaction costs -- during two consecutive six-month periods , and that the median profit was just such an effort : about us $ 4000 . 
it is easy to conclude that it is futile to try to beat the market . 
but then we think about people like swensen . 
the consistent performance really can be attributed to luck ? 
robert kiyosaki , author of the series of books to success on the investment rich dad , poor dad , securities , and the themes of his works on a comparison between his father very graduate and the father of his friend , who has left school in fourth . 
according to kiyosaki , his father but scholarly scientist tended to be pessimistic about one 's ability to achieve something in real life , and had discouraged his son to try . 
however , the father of his friend loved try to do great things . 
the fact that he was rich , it is a coincidence ? 
kiyosaki may try too hard to be inspirational , but i often think of him when i hear finance professors opine on the efficiency of markets and the absurdity that there has to earn money through the transactions . 
it may be that many academics are finding it difficult to take initiatives in the real world -- and i have yet to meet another professor who have read kiyosaki . 
but swensen is an academic , doctor in economy . 
he is surrounded by academics . 
all these discussions on the efficiency of markets have not discouraged to try his luck and to get there . 
there seems to be a model . 
two similar universities , harvard and princeton , have had nearly the same success . 
the harvard endowment , under jack meyer , has increased its average annual return of 15,2 % over the past ten years , compared to 17,2 % of swensen , and the princeton endowment , under andrew golden , earned on average 15,6 % per year . 
in fact , golden worked under the aegis of swensen at yale from 1988 to 1993 . 
swensen has written two books on the investment , one for professionals and one for the general public . 
in the closing , i have not had the impression of being able to do what he did . 
but a few things stand out . 
one of them is its long-term vision . 
yale lets swensen invest for the very long term , and does not bother him about quarterly results . 
maybe this allows him to focus more on long-term fundamentals , and thus to make investments that were not necessarily a good performance in the short term . 
but , in fact , he has consistently achieved good results in both the short term and long term . 
part of the success of swensen is " absolute return , " a term now widespread in the community of investors , that he has invented to unusual investment strategies involving things like merger arbitrage and the difficulties ( distressed securities ) . 
he has also invested in non-traditional asset classes , like real estate , oil , timber , capital investment , and venture capital firms . 
these assets are generally not followed by many analysts , and are not easy to understand , giving him a greater advantage in applying its intellectual capacity and the expertise of his entourage . 
in this sense , swensen is completely different from day traders , who invest in the short term and trying to beat the most crowded market , the values quoted on the stock exchange . 
but i also think that the phenomenal success of swensen and its peers reflects the environment that kiyosaki criticizes . 
the problem is a defeatist attitude , not scholarship . 
when an analytical mind , a spirit led to pursue the truth with rigour , as part of a community of such people is released from self-doubt , it can produce amazing things . 
i know david swensen , and i can testify that this is not a lonely day trader trying to beat the market . 
he knows listen , support the people he trusts , and he is surrounded by many people the qualities many and varied . 
and it is not a defeatist . 
a moral food 
according to forecasts , global consumption of meat should double by 2020 . 
yet , in europe and north america , there is growing concern about the moral aspect of the methods of production of meat and eggs . 
the consumption of veal has fallen since it became widely known for producing the so-called " white " ( actually pale pink ) , newborn calves are separated from their mother , roughage private , and kept in cages so small that it cannot walk or turn around . 
in europe , mad cow disease has shocked many people , not only because it shattered the image of a safe and healthy food beef , but also because the public has learned that the disease was caused by feeding cows , brains and nerve tissue of sheep . 
people who naively believed that cows eat grass have discovered that the herds for our food could eat anything from corn to fish , chicken litter ( feces included ) slaughterhouse waste . 
the concerns raised by our way of dealing with the animals are far from being limited to the small percentage of vegetarians or vegans , those who do not consume any product of animal origin . 
despite the solidity of the moral arguments vegetarianism , it is not yet the prevailing opinion . 
more common is the view that our consumption of meat is justified the moment that animals live a decent life before being killed . 
the problem , as jim mason and i describe in our last book , the way we eat , is that industrial agriculture refuses to animals the slightest chance of having a decent life . 
tens of billions of chickens products of our days never go outdoors . 
they are bred to have a voracious appetites and gain weight as fast as possible , then pupil in sheds that can contain more than 20 000 animals . 
the rate of ammonia in the air , due to the accumulation of their droppings stings the eyes and hurts the lungs . 
killed in 45 days , their immature bones can barely support the weight of their bodies . 
some collapse and , unable to reach food or water , die . their fate is only a negligible amount to the economics of the whole company . 
the conditions are worse for the hens crammed into wire cages , so small that even if there were only one by cage , they would be unable to open the wings . 
but they are generally piled up by four , often more . 
in such conditions of overcrowding , the hens the more dominant and aggressive can piquer to death the weakest of the cage . 
to prevent this , producers cut off the tip of the tooth of hens with a hot blade . 
a hen 's beak is full of nervous tissues . this is , after all , her principal means of communication with its environment , but no anaesthetic or analgesic is used to relieve the pain . 
pigs are perhaps the animals the most intelligent and sensitive that we used to eat . 
when foraging in a rural village , they can exercise this intelligence to explore their environment and diversity . 
before putting low , the sows use straw or leaves and twigs to build a comfortable and safe nest where deal with their scope . 
but in today 's factory farms , pregnant sows are kept in crates so narrow that they cannot turn around , or even do more of a step forward or backward . 
they lie to concrete without straw or any other form of bedding . 
the piglets are taken from their mother as soon as possible , so that it can fall pregnant again , but they never leave the warehouse before being taken to slaughter . 
the defenders of these production methods argue that this is a regrettable but necessary response at the request of food to a growing population . 
on the contrary , when we confine animals in factory farms , we need to produce food for them . 
the animals burn up most of the energy provided by this food just to breathe and heat their body , so we ultimately only a small fraction , usually no more than a third and sometimes only a tenth of the value of the food that we give them . 
by contrast , cows grazing in the pasture eat food that we cannot digest , which means that they add to the amount of food available to us . 
it is tragic that countries such as china and india , as they become copy , the western methods and putting animals in huge industrial farms to provide more meat and eggs for their growing middle classes . 
if this continues , the result will be animal suffering on a larger scale than what is currently in the west , more damage to the environment and an increase in heart disease and cancers of the digestive system . 
this will also be totally ineffective . 
as consumers , we have the power , and the moral obligation , refuse to support farming methods that are cruel to animals and bad for us . 
the fear and freedom on the internet 
we have learned at the beginning of the month at the request of the chinese leadership , microsoft shut down the web site of a chinese blogger by a microsoft service called msn spaces . 
the blogger , zhao jing , had published information on a strike by journalists at the beijing , which followed the dismissal of independent-minded editor of the newspaper . 
the gesture of microsoft raises a key question : can the internet really be a liberating force that authoritarian governments cannot control as easily as newspapers , radio and television ? 
ironically , when you think that the founder and leader of microsoft , bill gates , has been an enthusiastic supporter of this point of view . 
in october , he said : " there 's really no way , in the broadest sense , to suppress information today , and i think this is a wonderful advance we can all celebrate ... this is a means of communication and openness total freedom , and that is what makes it so special . " 
despite these sentiments , microsoft is helping its best the chinese authorities to censor the information . 
a microsoft spokeswoman said that the company had blocked " many sites " in china , and it is known for several months that the tool used to make chinese blogs filters words like " democracy " and " human rights " when they appear in the securities of personal sites . 
the defence of microsoft is that it must " comply with local and global laws . " 
but the sites of msn spaces are hosted by servers in the united states . 
local laws to respect in this case are those of the united states , and discussions of zhao jing on the beijing journalists " strike does not violate any of them . 
there is no global law preventing the chinese to discuss events that their government would prefer them not to discuss . 
the new york times , for example , is free to publish its articles on the strike , even if it is broadcast on a website that all with unfettered internet access can consult . 
if the chinese government does not want its citizens to read a foreign newspaper , it is up to him to figure out how to block access . 
the newspaper is under no obligation to do so in his place . 
microsoft 's defense is therefore long fire . 
we can only guess the real reasons that led to the closing the site ; and fear of repercussions on its commercial interests in china could well be a major factor . 
of course , a company can and must put limits on the use of its services . 
the absolutist line , which is to leave the absolute freedom prevail , collapses in the face of uncomfortable examples . 
according to gates , microsoft might prevent the use of its services if they were used to spread instructions to make a nuclear bomb , to send the nazi propaganda in germany , where it is illegal , or distributing child pornography . 
these examples are they really valid ? 
in his classic defense of freedom of expression , freedom , john stuart mill argued that the most important reason for freedom of expression is to promote competition between the widest possible range of ideas , and that unfettered debate is the best way to test them . 
protecting the ideas of criticism , the government turns them into dogma rigid and no life , that they are true or not . 
if we agree with mill , then a single example of gates corresponds to the category of expression that should be protected . 
recipes for making nuclear bombs are techniques , not ideas . 
the pornography is not the expression of ideas . 
so we can restrict both without contradict the thesis of mill . 
( on the other hand , an essay arguing that there is nothing wrong with adults to a sexual interest in children , and that such behaviour should be admitted , expresses ideas , and thus they may seem to us , as such should not be censored . ) 
the most difficult of gates 's three examples is that of pro-nazi statements on a web site aimed at germany . 
it is easily understandable that germany wants to ban such views . 
the laws of many countries ban incitement to racial hatred , which can be justified , in agreement with the defence of freedom of mill , if such laws focus closely on incitement to hatred rather than on the removal of theses , bad as they may be , that appeal to people 's intellectual capacities . 
a defender of the removal of nazi ideas might argue that they have already been tried , and failed , the most horrendous manner imaginable , to produce a better society . 
nevertheless , the best possible sign that germany has exceeded its nazi past would be to focus its laws specifically on racial hatred , rather than on nazism as such . 
in all cases , china 's crackdown in straightforward reporting and discussion of events taking place in this country is not the suppression of a discredited political ideology , but that of open and informed political debate . 
if bill gates really believes that the internet should be a liberating force , it should ensure that microsoft is not doing the dirty work of the chinese government . 
the weaknesses of a strong dollar 
it is always dangerous to write an article about the exchange rate . 
if the exchange rate of a currency falling , it may well be rising when article seems . 
is the perennial question of how we should think about exchange rates and their appropriate management . 
the issue here is not just the falling dollar , but rather what american officials intend to do about it . 
paul o 'neill , the very direct us treasury secretary , suggests that the united states cannot and do not want to intervene to support the dollar . 
his remarks were criticized by some as an abandonment of the strong dollar policy which was the clinton administration 's hallmark . 
one of the responsibilities of economic leadership is to dispel the myths economic , certainly not to create them . 
the " strong dollar " policy represents an especially egregious example of economic myths which can develop . this myth suggests that the us treasury could , and would , maintain a strong dollar , and that a strong dollar is good for the united states . 
when i was chairman of the president 's council of economic advisers , i was often asked if i supported the strong dollar policy . 
i replied that i supported the policy of " dollar balanced " . 
in other words , exchange rates are no different from other prices . 
just as the price of apples and oranges , they should be set by the law of the market . 
anyone who says he believes in a " strong orange policy " would be ridiculed . 
and yet , there are those who seem to have the utmost confidence in the market believe the exchange rate as governed by laws other than those of the regular economy , so that a word or even a look from a finance minister could raise or lower the currencies . 
the foreign exchange markets are of course very irrational . 
keynes once described asset markets as beauty contests , in which the goal was not to assess the most beautiful person , but others will crown . 
the aim of a foreign exchange market , in fact , is often to guess what others say . 
and even if the government policies can affect exchange rates in the short term , in the long term , only the rules of the market count . 
the government can find a legitimate role in limiting the volatility of the market , but if the basic rules of the market do not lead the dance of exchange rates , where does our confidence in the law of the market ? 
stick to misguided notions inevitably leads to more nonsense . 
it arrived a day when a journalist asked the us treasury on the negative effects of the strong dollar on exports ( at the time , sales of cars and other exports suffered from this strong dollar ) . 
he said that a strong dollar meant that the economy was strong and that of this fact , exports . 
despite everything , even the ministry of finance , as strong as it is , cannot repeal the laws of the market economy . 
the curves of the flagging demand : so , when prices are high , american products are less sought , and a strong dollar means that american products are more expensive . 
perhaps the most important objection to the strong dollar policy is that it encourages precisely this confusion between a strong dollar and a strong economy . 
we should not be emotionally attached to the exchange rate more than any other price . 
a high exchange rate discourages exports , and deal with the unemployment of its labor force , a country can see its economy go from bad to worse . 
furthermore , a higher exchange rate may also help to lower inflation , as import prices fall . 
if inflation is the primary concern then a strong exchange rate may be good for the economy . 
the strong dollar policy reeks of an economic nationalism that is out of step with the era of globalization . 
if the dollar is strong , then the euro and the yen is weak . 
and so what are the reactions of the political leaders of other countries ? 
should they simply agree to the strong dollar policy , even if it means a policy of yen or the euro weak ? 
it is necessary to create the conditions for a debate with the united states since the strong dollar policy leads to an anomalous situation : the richest country seems unable to live within its means and must continually borrow hundreds of billions of dollars abroad to finance its huge trade deficit . 
the strong dollar fueled the bilateral deficit with japan more than japanese protectionism the did . 
it has also contributed to the protectionist policy of the united states that we see today in the price of steel . 
it is high time that the nonsense of the strong dollar policy be abandoned . 
paul o 'neill should be commended for his efforts in this area . 
perhaps we can now launch a serious reflection on the creation of an international economic system taking into account the devastating effects of market volatility among major currencies for less developed countries , in order to ensure greater stability . 
for too long , we have accused the victims . 
it has served only to avoid a serious look at the system itself . 
china it wrong his world ? 
cheating ! 
how , says the us , could china selling cheaper american producers in so many areas ? 
for decades , america seemed to dominate the manufacture so that us officials focused on trade liberalisation for manufactured products . 
they have put little effort into creating a level playing field for farmers because they knew that america could not compete in agriculture . 
now , china is on the other countries , gets huge trade surpluses with the united states . 
the us treasury accuses china of keeping its exchange rate deliberately low and ask him to let market forces determine the value of the reminbi . 
the imf 's chief economist , ken rogoff , who is leaving his post , warns that the surpluses threaten the stability of the world . 
for those who remember the crisis that has produced in east asia five years ago , all of this seems to run counter to what was said at the time . 
china was urged not to let its currency float . 
until the implosion of the argentine peso , fixed exchange rates were perfectly . 
the us treasury welcomed government intervention in the markets of exchange rates and encouraged the imf to support such interventions with the mega billions of dollars to countries in crisis . 
if china had allowed its currency to float , it would have tanked and would thus have intensified the crisis . 
the countries have received a warning : avoid the trade surpluses and accumulate reserves , because they are the key frontline defense . 
the east asian countries have followed this advice , and for a good reason : they had seen the consequences of a lack of reserves . 
east asia 's governments knew then that the imf 's policies would only serve to exacerbate their economic downturn , but they found themselves unable to resist . 
the imf had the money they needed . 
china and malaysia , lucky enough not to have to turn to the imf or brave enough to follow their own line , have acted as it should : they have pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies . 
china 's economy has continued to grow at 7 % ; malaysia had the economic downturn the shorter and shallower . 
to understand the stakes , it is necessary to explain a few fundamental economic concepts in detail . 
first of all , international trade is based on the principle of comparative advantage ; countries export goods in which they have a relative advantage and import goods in which they have a relative disadvantage . 
in general , america now has a relative disadvantage in manufacturing , while china has a relative advantage . 
china must be exporting manufactured goods to the united states . 
secondly , if a country invests more than it saves , it will need to borrow , and therefore a trade deficit . 
america 's burgeoning trade deficit is the result of the unprecedented mismanagement of the bush administration . 
the tax cuts that america could barely afford turned a huge fiscal surplus into a massive deficit ; rather than saving , the us government borrows , much of which abroad . 
it is this bad management , and not the exchange rate policy of china , which is the culprit . 
in fact , china 's overall trade surplus is currently low ( about 1 % of its gdp ) . 
of course , the bush administration wants to shift the blame , but neither china nor any other country , should be fooled . 
this situation reminiscent of what happened 20 years ago , when president reagan had drawn up huge tax cuts that were supposed to rectify the situation , but which , in fact , have led to huge fiscal deficits , which in turn led to huge trade deficits . 
back then , japan that america had rejected the responsibility of these deficits ! 
the truth is that neither the imf nor the bush administration really believes in free markets . 
they are hampering the markets when they find their interest . 
the bush administration has bailed out of airlines , unprecedented subsidies for agriculture and has protected the tariffs imposed on steel . 
the imf is right : there is a real risk of global instability , but the underlying cause of this threat lies in massive us borrowing abroad , which began under president reagan . 
the united states are thus become a huge debtor . 
if , one day , america 's creditors decide to be reimbursed , they could trigger of large exchange rate movements and causing global instability . 
why the imf has not criticised severely these deficits ? 
why the world 's richest country should live beyond its means while the imf reprimand poorer countries for smaller transgressions ? 
this problem is compounded by the global reserve system , which welcomes the demands of the majority of countries demanding us dollars , but only penalise them more . 
the system requires that the reserve currency country ( in this case , the united states ) accumulates the debts until the other countries may make him more confidence . 
but to solve the deep-seated problems in the global financial system , we must go beyond the complacency that has long invaded the g-7 and the unilateralism that defines the current us administration . 
china is right to ignore the demands of america . 
floating the exchange rate would expose the country to instabilities that would lead to a host of other problems , particularly the country 's shaky banking system . 
a higher exchange rate would have shaken the process of creating jobs and contributed to deflation , which china is successfully repel . 
china has the chance to have the freedom to pursue its own objectives . 
its huge foreign currency reserves enable him to ignore the imf and the us treasury . 
in the end , this may be the most compelling reason why china must continue to maintain trade surpluses . 
once again , china has shown its mastery of basic economic principles . 
the other countries in the region are whining for not having acted similarly . 
italy will it survive berlusconi ? 
if history seems to rank silvio berlusconi in the category of prime ministers , it will surely remember him as a prime minister out of the ordinary and the weird . 
make a promise , but delivering another was not a principle of government action that a weakness . 
given its unpredictability , it is hardly surprising that since the 2001 election that brought to power , the center-left coalition unione has won all the elections that followed ( administrative elections , regional and european ) . 
but the success of the left for the next parliamentary elections is not assured and the fate of berlusconi is not yet sealed . 
given the country 's economic situation , you might think italy ripe for change . 
for four years , the average income increased only 0,3 % per year , whereas it has risen by an average of 1,5 % in the european union , and for two years public debt has started to widen . 
the strategy of the center-right coalition of berlusconi , casa della belong , has been to do nothing until the european economy is improving , instead of treating the structural difficulties of italy . 
that is why it is not only the unions who criticise the government , but also the confindustria , which put its weight behind berlusconi in 2001 . 
there is also the incessant conflict of interest between the berlusconi prime minister and the berlusconi media mogul which holds licenses that make him a position of semi-monopoly for advertising in the media and on tv . 
during his term , his personal fortune has multiplied by three . 
the parliamentary majority voted number of laws in favour of his personal interests and have eased some of the legal obstacles that stand up on its way . however , beginning march , berlusconi was again accused of corruption and tax fraud . 
the conduct of its ministers has been much better . 
two of them , roberto calderoli and francesco were forced to resign in a month of each other . 
the first , a leader of the northern league , the third party in the coalition government , provoked riots in libya by wearing a t-shirt with the infamous cartoons of the prophet mohammed . 
the second , former health minister and one of the leaders of the national alliance , the second largest party in the coalition government , is suspected to be the source of a case of political espionage , watergate . 
despite this catalogue , both from the point of view of the economy that of ethics , according to opinion polls , unione displays a lead of four points only , too little in terms of the number of undecided voters , to predict the outcome of the election . 
what does that berlusconi and his coalition are still in the race ? 
above all , the election campaign of berlusconi , as the bush administration in 2004 , aims to mobilize its supporters and draw the growing number of non-voters . 
for this , it has not hesitated to use his semi-monopoly on television to tout the so-called wonders performed by his government . 
his campaign rhetoric is based on a anti-communism that we had not seen in italy since 1948 , coupled with a defense of the family and values dear to the establishment of the roman catholic church , although the church has not so far left to draw in the campaign . 
the berlusconi coalition also benefits the weakness of the 'unione . 
its leader , romano prodi , obtained an extraordinary popular support with more than four million votes cast in primary elections , the first of this kind in italy . 
but himself without a party , it continues to be the head of too many parties . 
the cohesion of the 'unione has strengthened : the two major parties ( democratici di sinistra and democrazia e belong - the margherita ) gathered behind the emblem of the olive tree , the other parties are 280-page government program detailed in a document of 280 pages and the left-wing partito della rifondazione comunista has given signs of moderation devoid of any ambiguity and loyalty to the coalition . 
despite everything , in the eyes of voters , the coalition remains fragile . 
finally , the uncertainty of the outcome of the elections does not reflect both the attitude of voters that a change in the electoral system . 
during the last decade , the italian electoral system was based on a majority vote to a tour with a dose of proportional . 
with this system , casa della belong in 2001 into a small advance a decisive parliamentary majority . 
but , fearing that this system has now to unione , the center-right parliamentary majority has changed the election rules , only a few months before the end of his term . 
this is not without recalling the military strategy which is before the defeat which on the battlefield , poisons the wells retreat . 
a proportional system without the opportunity to choose individual candidates fact that party secretaries , rather than citizens , who choose members , and in the absence of a real electoral threshold , the parties are proliferating . 
ballot papers will be 40 centimeters long to accommodate all the symbols of the old and new parties , but we will not find the name of one candidate . 
but the more serious is that the first-past-the-post electoral system for the senate could lead to a majority opposed to parliament , resulting in a political deadlock . 
and this is not all , the office of president carlo azeglio ciampi ends at the same time that parliament will be dissolved , which means that his successor will be elected by the new members may have to appoint a government with a majority in every room . 
berlusconi and prodi have ruled out a grand coalition of the kind that exists in germany , a very unlikely outcome after a campaign in which each of the two candidates have strongly hinted that the other has no legitimate right to govern . 
and an election more would not solve the problem of the electoral system . 
the puzzle of berlusconi 's survival reflects a wider problem at european level . 
many europeans , and not only italians , are nervous and unsure of where the continent is going . 
so it is not surprising that an opportunist and charlatan as berlusconi continues to get a hearing . 
the italians must decide for the future of their country if they want a leader who has the necessary stature . 
the game of transatlantic criticism 
as if the diplomatic spat over iraq were not enough , relations between america and europe are slowly poisoned by divergent economic policies . 
indeed , the differences between the two sides " economic strategies are as sharp as they have been in two decades . 
at first glance , the depth of this " policy gap " seems surprising . 
the economic outlook for the rest of this year and in 2004 has improved recently both in the us and europe . 
in addition , the united states and europe face a similar challenge : to promote economic recovery . 
but the actions of their government ( or rather the lack of action ) , seem to indicate that either of the two camps cannot see the problems faced by the other . 
in the introduction of the euro , most eu members ( germany , in particular ) looked forward to manage their economic policies with greater autonomy and less us pressure . 
thus , the current structure in the euro zone , with its unique mix of monetary policy and national responsibility for fiscal policy , has not been built to facilitate the macro-economic coordination with the us . 
but the perception of many american observers was different . 
they saw the central implication of the euro as requiring europe to junk its supposed role of " free rider " on the international economic scene , a role which left the us shouldering the burden of policy adjustments to promote world growth . 
europe would inevitably be forced to coordinate policy with america . 
these two views were bound to conflict , and that is what is happening today . 
tensions hidden during the long boom of the clinton era have proved in 2001 when america has tried to cope with the drop in its economy by rapidly easing its monetary and fiscal policies . 
when the big budget deficits returned , the european scepticism about the viability of america 's mounting external deficit and the overvalued dollar . 
american critics , meanwhile , saw the euro zone as too cautious for cutting interest rates slowly and maintaining the fiscal constraints of the stability and growth pact . 
initially , the europeans had underestimated the economic slowdown to which they were facing . 
subsequently , they have been forced by the limits imposed on their fiscal reactions limits set by the maastricht treaty ; the large economies of continental europe had not done enough budgetary consolidation during the years of steady growth . 
monetary and fiscal policies have facilitated the growth , but europe has not done much to redress the imbalance outside of america . 
of course , the euro area is so vast that it can no longer leave the responsibility to boost global growth in america . 
but us efforts to encourage europeans to adopt their discretionary and pragmatic approach to economic policy inevitably lead to frustration : the problems faced by the european economies are different from those facing the us , like the perceptions of the challenges . 
in fact , the main reasons for the massive swing in us public finances ( from surplus in 2000 to a deficit of more than 4 % in 2003-04 ) have little to do with stabilization . 
in addition to the costs of the iraq war and other security issues and shortcomings in the previous controls of spending , tax cuts of the us structural and distributional rather than short-term goals . 
a short-term stimulus would not have given the largest benefits to the richest people , whose spending is less sensitive to taxes . 
the cuts should support private demand this year and next year , but at the cost of postponing improvements in economies and private debts . 
although the dollar has been depreciating for a year , continuing growth in domestic demand will likely push the current account deficit above 5 % of gdp . 
while the deficit widens further , it is likely that the dollar is once again downgraded despite the rather slow performance of the world 's other major economies . 
the us accept a prolonged slowdown after 2004 and europe it can make a greater contribution to global growth ? 
it is likely that no . 
the equivalent of the emphasis placed by the us on independence rather than direct public assistance is represented by the desire to maintain employment at high levels , regardless of the party in power , while most european countries have been prepared to accept unemployment rates of 8 % or more . 
the us should therefore opt for growth . 
despite three years of low growth , the gap between the potential and actual output in the largest economies of continental europe is currently smaller than in the us . 
income tax cuts to stimulate demand for labor and investment are desirable given high rates in europe 's largest economies . 
but tax cuts that must soon be cancelled mainly due to demographic pressure on pensions and the public health care have little chance to stimulate demand , consumers lose confidence in the government 's ability to control deficits . 
europe needs structural reforms and tighter fiscal management , not inflation . 
the eu countries are finally accelerating their implementation of structural reforms , but the starting point has become less favorable and political resistance too firmly anchored , as illustrated by the recent conflict on reforms of french pensions and the german labor market . 
further dollar depreciation and a slower us growth undermine exports to the eu , the only relatively successful component of demand in europe . 
the difference in policy and its time horizon will be papered over by the improved outlook for growth in europe and the us for the coming year . 
but the medium-term outlook is one of transatlantic confrontation , likely as divisive as the conflict on the war in iraq . 
if this is true , the cycle of international trade negotiations in doha , currently being held , could be the first to suffer . 
it will be more difficult to resist protectionism on both sides of the atlantic . 
the us cannot afford a continuing massive drain of demand through an external deficit , while complaints relating to the loss of competitiveness will intensify in the eu . 
the thought that the coming macroeconomic confrontation could subside quickly or quietly puts the imagination to the test . 
a multilateral commitment in favour of energy security 
the different countries of the world are linked also strongly by their common need of energy security by the global network which ensures the distribution of this energy . 
a failure in one part of the network , and we are all affected . local interests and sustainable conflicts life , and particularly the unresolved issue of supplies to ukraine and europe russian gas , remind us once again that energy can be used as a means of political pressure . 
energy security is one of the priorities of the g-8 meeting hosted by president vladimir putin in st petersburg . 
the g-8 has been able to identify the key economic issue , namely the interdependence of energy , and it is now time to take specific multilateral commitments in this area . 
for some countries , who have blessed with vast reserves of oil and gas , it is tempting to use of exports to help friends and punish enemies . 
but these days , such a strategy is likely to destabilize both friends and enemies , and damaging the country producer . 
embargoes , does not generally the desired results . 
the price rises triggered by the actions of opec in the 1970s were not tolerated and led to conservation and the development of the production in non-eu countries opec . 
this has led to a fall of opec 's share of global exports of oil in the 12 years following the embargo of 1973-1974 . 
the experience has taught us that transparency and price stability is in the interest of all . 
it is essential , to increase the potential for growth in the global economy , these principles while encouraging the development of international markets . 
when russia has earlier this year to quadruple the price of its gas exports to ukraine , it argued that the market price . 
this seemed fair and , for some time , some politicians and investors not fully apprised of the situation . 
let us be clear , measured and gradual evolution prices has never been challenged ; some adjustments were necessary for the ukraine . 
but , unfortunately for russia 's neighbors , this is not the market that sets the price of russian gas or transport : this is the company gazprom and its president , dmitry medvedev , who is also first deputy prime minister of russia . 
the asking price by gazprom is different for each country neighbouring russia , and is largely determined by diplomatic relations with the kremlin . 
the prices depend more on the political situation that of supply and demand or transport costs . 
ukraine has been threatened to see its gas bill immediately multiplied by four -- or its supply interrupted -- because it came independence russia during the orange revolution . 
georgia , which had angered moscow with the rose revolution , risked also suffer significant price rises . 
belarus , however , still in very close to the kremlin , continues to enjoy considerable subsidies in the energy field . 
of course , ukraine was not the only country affected by these intimidation : some suppliers such as turkmenistan , geographically to smuggle the gas by russia , also suffer . 
as consumer countries of central and western europe , rising prices and the fear of a supply disruption have had for them important consequences . 
this is probably the immediate multilateral intervention by the european union and the united states , which has prompted gazprom to reopen the floodgates . 
natural gas is perhaps the first whose supply is the most vulnerable to the vagaries of policies . 
the fixed interconnected pipelines lock producers and consumers in a fidelity almost absolute . 
the diversification of the delivery of natural gas is a cross-border project in the long term , which requires huge investments and a political commitment multilateral . 
many solutions are the study : new gas storage , increased efficiency , development of domestic production of oil and gas , and other renewable energy such as methane coal . 
in addition , the market for liquefied natural gas ( lng ) is growing rapidly . 
it is easier to diversify the supply chain , even gradually , in important gas from distant producers and not more suppliers neighbours with a monopoly . 
all these initiatives should allow us to absorb the shocks and create more energy self-sufficiency . 
but we need to go further . 
first , the g-8 leaders should consider implementing standards for transactions in the energy field , and to demand open and transparent contracts in line to the best business practices . 
it is essential to minimize the impact on the global scale of the behaviour of local politicians pursuing energy agendas , or simply their personal interests . 
there are problems of this type in state-owned firms in latin america , with political instability in africa , tensions in the middle east or opaque intermediaries , as for the questionable gas deal between ukraine and russia , under the name of street ( rosukrenergo ) . 
in the end , energy security for all of us in europe is based on the recognition of our interdependence . 
that is why it would be helpful to create an " energy alliance " of consumers and suppliers , in which the european countries helping to guarantee in the event of a major disruption . 
the energy charter , which focuses on access to the market and transparency , is a laudable effort , but it is insufficient in the event of a crisis . our markets are not yet sufficiently equipped to manage interruptions of supply . 
the energy charter could serve as a basis for a collective energy security , if deepened and enlarged . 
it is our duty as leaders to find a future path to energy security . 
if some tolerate today suspicious transactions by political expediency , as we all pay for a day when the other . 
when the inevitable conflict occurs , the public trust , the political credibility and the laws of the market are sacrificed needlessly . this is obviously what happened with russia and ukraine . 
threats to energy security must be challenged and resolved multilaterally with the participation of all stakeholders . 
our interdependence obliges us to adopt a multilateral approach . 
this is our future is at stake . 
reform or revolution in iran ? 
lebanon at the risk of the manipulation 
for a few weeks ago , lebanese politicians from groups as diverse as hezbollah and the christian lebanese forces meet from time to time in the context of a " national dialogue . " 
their first objective is to forge a consensus on the future of lebanon after the withdrawal of the syrian army which took place last year . 
but this dialogue has shown that lebanese politics continues to play out of lebanon . 
the syrian regime of president bashar assad retains a huge influence on the lebanese state , particularly in relation to security issues , the secret service , the army and the police , not to mention its alliance with the powerful hezbollah militia . 
the syrian soldiers have left lebanon a year ago , but the regime assad has never accepted its withdrawal from lebanon , and it seeks to regain some form of hegemony over the country . 
the syrian position is made more difficult by the un inquiry , which accuses him of being involved in the assassination of former prime minister rafiq hariri , on february 14 , 2005 . 
the syria 's lebanese allies want to improve ties between the two countries , but the hariri murder will no doubt have cherry . 
for the moment , the lebanese parties have agreed not to leave the country serve as a basis for threatening in any way the syrian regime . 
at the same time , egypt and saudi arabia are desperate to avoid the fall of assad 's regime . 
officially these two countries are in favour of the un inquiry , but in private , their leaders have heavily prompted the lebanese government to ease the pressure on syria . 
in lebanon , the opponents of syria have resisted this requirement , but the position of egypt and saudi arabia , shows that the arab leaders do not want the fall of the despots of the region . 
the attitude of egypt and saudi arabia differs we can no more that one of the two western powers very influential in lebanon , the united states and france , which support the un inquiry , wherever it leads . 
however , these four countries agree that syrian influence in lebanon must be contained , and they are in favour , at least in theory , the disarming of hezbollah required by the security council resolution 1559 , even though their views differ on how to get there . 
another regional problem , the cycle of violence between sunnis and shiites in iraq , also marks the lebanese internal policy . 
lebanon 's sunnis and shiites - the two main communities in the country because of their demographic weight and the support they have in the region - are far from be at this stage , but since little political tension is palpable between them . 
hariri was the main sunni politician , and after his assassination , the two communities have adopted the diametrically opposed positions to syria . 
the gap between shiites and sunnis in lebanon reflects broader regional frictions between the majority of the arab countries , particularly saudi arabia ) who are sunnis and support saad hariri , the son of the assassinated prime minister , and iran , which supports hezbollah . 
in saudi arabia , the shiites are concentrated in the eastern part of the country of oil and the saudis fear that the discord between shiites and sunnis in iraq will spread in the arab world and not a reach . 
that is why riyadh has encouraged hariri not to break the dialogue with hezbollah , the main force in the lebanese shia community . 
apart from this concern , saudi arabia and egypt are afraid that if iran manages to nuclear weapons , it could lead to a shiite dominance in the region . 
add to this the tension between iran and the united states , fueled by the controversy on nuclear power and the conflict in iraq . 
the arab countries are sandwiched between the two , as the lebanese , who fear to pay the price for any american or israeli attack against iran 's nuclear facilities . because hezbollah could then attack israel from south lebanon . 
hezbollah interprets the resolution calling for its disarmament as a plot by the bush administration to weaken the display and american supremacy in the region . 
it refuses to disarm facing what he calls the israeli threat , but it has so many times changed the definition that it gives this threat that one wonders if it will ever to arms . 
it has recently agreed to place the issue on the domestic negotiating agenda - perhaps because iran does not want it to be a source of tension in the country - but it is unlikely that they lead to a real disarmament , at least in the short term . 
finally , the lebanese must not only manoeuvre depending on considerations of regional and international policy , but they must also take into account the american domestic politics . 
whatever the opinion about the war in iraq , the us presence in this country has helped lebanon to thwart attempts to syria to put foot in lebanon , and those of some arab countries efforts to compel the lebanon to deal with a regime that loathes its sovereignty . 
if the us pull out of iraq , they may become indifferent to the situation in lebanon . 
in this case , who else that syria and iran will withdraw the benefits ? 
such an outcome would surely be satisfactory for some elements of lebanese society , particularly hezbollah . 
but the vast majority of the lebanese want a lebanon in peace , free from the isolation and militancy that characterize iran and syria . 
unfortunately , lebanon has always been buffeted by its environment and once more , against the will of the lebanese , it could serve as an arena for destructive regional conflicts . 
at the end of trade , the stock market of prague bascula in the negative 
after the fall of tuesday morning , the prague stock exchange r√©ctifia its losses . 
transactions with the actions ƒçez reached almost half the usual daily exchanges . 
on tuesday , at the beginning of trade , the stock market of prague renoua with its fall the day before , when it lost nearly six percent . 
this time , the fall is due to the fall of the actions on wall street . 
the reaction of the market in the face of the outcome of the vote in the us house of representatives , who refused to adopt the plan to stabilise the us financial sector , is perceptible and also at home . 
fall of actions in asia 
asian stock markets tuesday lived a dramatic fall , even if the clues succeeded , during the day , to erase some of the losses . 
the hang seng index in hong kong lost four percent during the exchange , but later it effa√ßa some of the losses and reduced the drop to almost 2,5 percent . 
the hang seng index china enterprises following the movement of chinese actions of the stock exchange of hong kong lost 3,8 percent , the markets are closed to shanghai . 
the actions of the stock exchange in sydney lost over five percent , but ultimately we manage to reduce the losses to 4,3 percent . 
according to its index , the taiwan stock exchange lost 3,6 percent . 
" the hesitation about action to rescue the us will have on the world 's financial markets , " observed joseph yam , the chief of the monetary office of hong kong . 
although hong kong is part of china , it establishes its monetary policy itself , that is , regardless of the chinese central bank . 
interest rates have in hong kong the same level as in the united states . 
according to australian prime minister kevin rudd , american legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal of supporting the financial system . 
otherwise , we risk that other countries are suffering the impact . 
the bloodshed equities 
on monday , the us house of representatives rejected the draft supports the financial system , which it would have had to devote up to $ 700 billion ( nearly 12 bilions of kƒç ) . 
the legislators reni√®rent and the call to supports the project of president george bush . 
after bush , the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilise the economy as a whole . 
american actions lived , on monday , bloodshed and the main indices of actions had the largest fall in the past 20 years . 
the dow jones industrial average lost nearly seven percent , having been a fall of such a scale for the last time in 1987 . 
the index lost already during the vote , but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted , it was in free fall . 
congress gave way : the government of the united states can inject $ 700 billion in banks 
the leaders of congress and the government of president george w. bush have agreed on a form of the agreement of financial assistance to the us financial system . 
it will be put to the vote early next week . 
american legislators effectu√®rent a turning point in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial aid to an amount of $ 700 billion ( about 12 trillion kroner ) , given to the us financial system . 
the success is not provided course . 
indeed , before we can publish the final version of the law and submit it to the vote , the congressmans must finish a number of details of the agreement . 
the plan to support the financial system will be examined on monday to the house of representatives . 
said sunday in the reuters news agency barney frank , the chairman of the committee of the banking and financial regulation of the chamber . 
according to the sources , on wednesday at the earliest , the plan should a priori be put to the vote in the senate . 
according to economists , the announcement of the fact that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a first major psychological factor to revive the financial markets . 
however , given the complexity of the mechanisms through which the aid to markets may be effective , will follow a " delusional . " 
paulson : the plan must be effective 
" we have made great progress . 
we have solved our views on the form that should have the package of measures for the stabilisation of the market , " assigned to the agency bloomberg the democrat nancy pelosi . 
according to them , the final vote could be done by sunday . 
in the night of saturday to sunday , representatives of legislators rencontr√®rent the us treasury secretary henry paulson , in order to give at the bottom of the government a final form . 
it should buy from financial companies , the assets unsellable property which lead to financial firms in significant losses and threaten the stability of the system in its entirety . 
" we are on the verge of agreeing on a plan that will work and must be , also , effective on the market . 
we still need to continue this recovery plan of markets , but i think we are , " said paulson . 
a signal to the asian exchanges 
the global financial crisis has impacted the markets of actions that fall . 
according to the senator √©vadiez democrat harry reid , the legislators are so that congress will lead to a final agreement by sunday . 
they want to and calm investors before the start of trade on the asian financial markets , which are located in the first time zone , where the decision of congress could influence the exchange on monday . 
for now , however , it is impossible to say with certainty when the two chambers of congress comes out to the vote , or if the negotiations will not remain blocked , at the last moment , by this or that problem . 
lawmakers hope that it will be adopted in the days to come . 
however , the law will still in many changes . 
the total amount designed to the help of the system must be divided into two parts . 
the first $ 350 billion , as wished president george bush , must be available as soon as possible . 
but , if the congress will have the impression that the programme does not meet its function , he has the opportunity to block the granting of the remaining amount , following two stages : first 100 billion dollars more , and then , finally , $ 350 billion . 
mr bush salua progress in the negotiations 
although the president can put its veto to this decision , congress has the possibility of putting it in the minority . 
despite these changes , the main thrust of the programme , which was to obtain finance for the purchase of bad mortgage securities , whose value fell , because hundreds of thousands of americans are not able to pay their mortgages , was maintained . 
" all the work is done . 
the house of representatives should be able to proceed sunday at the vote of the law , and the senate on monday , " told the republican senator judd gregg . 
us president george bush himself is pleased with progress in the negotiations . 
its spokesman tony fratto said that mr bush was pleased the progress made on saturday and appreciates the " bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy . " 
limiting the golden parachutes 
the president of the senate banking committee , christopher dodd , chief negotiator , said that the legislators have agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme , the protection of contributing against losses , the agreement of relief , the conduct of the plan on the axis of the time . 
the new law also plans to limit the so-called golden parachutes for the managers of companies participating in the programme and it establishes a committee , which will ensure the monitoring of the fund . 
the latter should be managed by the ministry of finance . 
" we have worked very hard on the issue and have made important progress toward an agreement that will work and will be effective in the market and for all americans , " said paulson . 
the plan also includes aid for homeowners , who have problems to pay . 
the government should negotiate new payments in the case of mortgages that it will buy , while lowering monthly repayments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes . 
marek : psychological assistance 
according to the chief economist of patria finance david marek , the proposed plan is a good idea , but its completion is going to be very difficult . 
" and this is due to the fact that we do not know what will be the mechanism and the price of buying assets . 
this will be crucial to decide on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government , " said marek , this week , the server ihned.cz. 
if the plan will be adopted now , or early next week , is , according to marek , not so important that this . 
" it is much more important than the congressmans agree , as early as this week , that they support this plan , and that they will devote as soon as possible . 
this psychological importance of the agreement , providing for the adoption of the plan , the most important thing at this moment , " stressed marek . 
a fight pushed to the extreme : mp3 players against the mobile . 
you advice , how to choose 
while almost all mobile can read mp3 files , no mp3 player knows telephone . 
it seems result clearly that it is better to buy only a phone . 
nonetheless , there are plenty of reasons to procure a reader independent . 
the choice depends entirely on the way we use and the requirements of the future owner . 
it would be absurd to buy for the home a gramophone expensive high-end to put the new record of maxim turbulenc . 
on the one hand , such music products do not come out on vinyl disc , and , from the point of view of the quality , there is no objective reason for that to happen . 
well , if there in your shelves cds vinyles packed , with the art rock , jazz and the blues , you love at least probably such a gramophone . 
it is music for travel , namely music being compressed , for the state simplified - music in the mp3 . 
there are also categories depending on the price and quality . 
for one , it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand kroner for a reader , in the same way as a fan of pink floyd would be hard-pressed to bear headphones bought for 20 kroner to the market . 
this is two extremes , where there is enough room for everyone . 
the choice is wide . 
the battery life is also decisive 
some readers of music high-end are capable of much more than a simple reading of music , but it is unknown functions , of course , most mobile . 
no current device is as universal as the phone . 
has side of the primary functions , the telephone calls and sending sms , it is able to read music and films , register them , it has a camera of varying quality and can , for example , up to serve to navigation . 
and if one takes into account the phones and communicators , you will have in your pocket a small computer . 
given that no shelve knows grilling meat and that no television will not take photographs , we are practically a miracle . 
however , the universality of the mobile is not without disadvantages . 
the greater the number of functions that you use , the space between two rechargements will be reduced . 
and the reading of the music is one of the most important goinfres of energy . 
rare are the mobile who are able to read music for ten to twelve hours , in most cases , the figure is significantly lower . 
in this respect , the readers of music ( especially the most rudimentary ) are much more efficient . 
in the case of cheap mobile , count that they will play music that for a few hours . 
if , in addition , it happens to you to call from time to time , procurez-vous , to be sure , a second charge for the work - having valid even for appliances more expensive . 
will should be no problem for mp3 players , which are able , following a reloading , a continuing operation of at least 9 hours , including the less efficient . 
another problem occurs during registration of music in the mobile . 
unfortunately , only a limited part of aircraft has a usb universal connector , as not all cannot be directly connected to the computer , without a special software . 
you can , of course , record music directly on the memory card , but little card readers know go without reduction , given the tiny dimensions of memory cards used in the mobile . 
as regards the readers , you do not need , except exception ( ipod ) , no software . 
it is enough to fill , through the usb connector , the apparatus of music from the computer . 
most of the mobile and readers will create themselves a library media classified according to the name of the performer , the title of the record , the style , or so after the judgment of the user . 
some aircraft the index with a structure of tree , to how to explore windows , others are capable of the two ( iriver , samsung , sony , cowon , smart phones with surgical system ) . 
readers are easier to manipulate , the mobile have more know-how 
in the choice of a device int√©ressez-vous concrete , especially in the life of the accumulateur , to the capacity of the memory , the quality and the type of exit of his and , of course , the ease of the order . 
if music is for you , essentially , a background noise and if in the day you 're going to listen to that for a limited time , for example by taking the tram , you just any mobile reading the mp3 . 
almost all the mobile in today are capable of . 
you are not even obliged to do too much attention to the formats of music that the mobile or the reader is able to read . 
all can read the mp3 and the vast majority of music which will reach you will precisely this format . 
it is one of the most prevalent formats and hand him , the vast majority of the devices can also read music wma format . 
the pca ( format used by the firm apple and its ipods ) , it is less common . 
the high-end mobile also allow , for example , the purchase of music online . 
it is enough to visit , since the mobile phone , the web pages of the operator ( or those of another supplier corresponding ) and buy the song or the record in question . 
this service alone should be a convincing reason to get a mobile music . 
the supply of operators is unfortunately wretched and it is limited , in most cases , radio tubes fast facts . 
the prices are not the lowest . 
however , it is generally believed that this way to buy music ( either by gsm , internet , or even by the wireless internet ) will dominate the music industry in the future . 
most people are always wearing their mobiles on itself . 
every time you want to listen to something , you have only to the mobile out of your pocket , so that you forgot your mp3 player at home . 
however , it is also important if you still have on you headphones or a handsfree with connection . 
if this is not the case , you can use the integrated pregnant , that have virtually all mobile , but a minimum of mp3 players . 
for many , the main advantage of musical mobile is their prices . 
the cheapest normally cost less than three thousand . 
for a price of three four thousand kroner , we can have a walkman already very proper . 
however , in most cases , you will be limited by the lack of exit for ordinary headphones . 
the price of the best phones and better equipped , also an entry for ordinary headphones , does not exceed fifteen thousand . 
readers , by contrast , have the advantage of having a command easy . 
really anyone happens to ensure the command of readers the most rudimentary - which do not necessarily correspond to the less expensive ( see our choice ) . 
a minimum of functions ; and the resemblance of the order with a cassette post , commonly used in the past , or a gramophone , is obvious . 
there is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile internet plugged in by chance , followed by a bill for transmission of data immense . 
what device choose 
even the cheapest mobile ( by g. the vodafone 527 ) generally have a slot for cards memoirs exchangeable ( the type m2 , microsd , and so on ) . 
even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card , you will not exceed two thousand kronor . 
but be careful . 
the basic models do not support in principle that maps with a maximum capacity of 2 gigabytes . 
only the more expensive fare even with maps memory of 8 gigabytes . 
if you have already a mobile and still want to buy an mp3 player cheap , take a cowon , a creative , a sony , a samsung , a emgeton , or a iriver . 
according to the capacity ( max . 2 gigabytes ) , you must not spend more than 1 100 kronor . 
if you are part of listeners more demanding , choose rather specialist mobiles-walkman ( sony ericsson , nokia and samsung ) . 
these devices are filled touches of independent command for mp3 players , and that is how the ease of the order is closer to that of an mp3 player independent . 
sony ericsson , whose mobile series walkman have the same menu user of mp3 players sold separately , is the one who went furthest in this area . 
the same service , in the same category of price , but with a capacity of memory ( up to 16 gigabytes ) and a life of the accumulateur ( normally 15 hours , until 35 hours ) superior , is made by an mp3 player produced by one of the marks mentioned above . 
a first virtual operator will gain the czech republic this year . 
perhaps 
the mobile market in the czech republic is relatively advanced , our operators offering virtually the same services that their partners in western europe . 
despite this , there is still something - a virtual operator , which would force the traditional operators to lower prices . 
it may be that it will not fail for a long time . 
we have already talked about repeatedly on mobil.cz the fact that operators czechs are among the most expensive in europe . 
the ƒçt√∫ ( the czech office of telecommunications ) , which pointed out that the price of an sms was higher at home than in the rest of the union , has confirmed . 
and that is , not following the latest of the european commission in the area of the regulation of roaming charges , a paradoxical situation could happen - sms sent from abroad will be for some customers mobile operators czechs cheaper than in the country . 
how is it possible that prices in the czech republic will continue if high , compared with europe ? 
the answer is simple , it lacks a competition that would really like to join the fight . 
this may seem paradoxical , given that we have when even three networks and a mobile penetration far exceeds the 100 % . 
on the contrary , the mobile operators like to complain that the czech market is extremely concurrenciez . 
in this , pavel dvo≈ô√°k , president of the council of the czech office telecommunications ( ƒçt√∫ ) , which has repeatedly said that in the czech republic there was more room for another operator , is join operators . 
it is probably true that a classic operator with its own network has apparently not much chance ( indeed , now it would be difficult to of frequencies ) . 
however , there is still a possibility - a virtual operator . 
it is precisely the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market which has led to a significant drop in prices , which were subsequently also react the traditional operators . 
yet , even before the entry spoilers such as tesco , virgin mobile or mobile on the market , similar to those that you hear today home is suggested in britain . 
however , it is apparent that there was room for such operators and that they could have a real success . 
we are not obliged to go too far to find examples of this . 
in february we had informed of the launch , in poland , the virtual operator mobilking . 
in just six months , this operator has managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator of the country . 
add that behind the mobilking , there is the financial group pentabde , which has , among other things , the u : fon in tch√®quie . 
the advantage of virtual operators as the opportunity to focus on a target group lot more concrete . 
for their operation to be effective , indeed they need far fewer customers that an operator classic . 
they are , indeed , free of the construction costs , exploitation and maintains the mobile network , relatively high . 
this is how in the world , the virtual operators are emerging as operators to low cost - they propose calls and text messages good market , which is often balanced by a supply of services limited . 
for example , mobile tesco proposes , in britain , sms at least two times cheaper than its competitors . 
however , as demonstrated by the example of mobilking in poland , capitalizing on a target group unusual can also be a good publicity stunt . 
indeed , this operator seeks specifically men . 
" the real men choose mobilking - an operator who they want , and that they can trust , " said david seibert , the ceo of mobile entertainment company , exploiting this virtual operator . 
it is difficult to say , if such a concept would be likely to walk also at home . 
miroslav ƒçepick√Ω , the spokesman for vodafone , in doubt : " the czech market is relatively small for a segmentaire approach , which is based most of virtual operators . 
all the more so because it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services . " 
in the czech republic , no chance , say the mobile operators 
nonetheless , it seems almost certain that there will be a virtual operator in the czech republic , this will not be mobilking . 
" we are discussing the expansion of this project to success , but in the czech republic the negotiations are not very promotrices . 
the launch of mobilking will rather place in other countries in our area , " said in a telephone maintains for mobil.cz jana studniƒçkov√° , spokesman for the financial group pentabde . 
it has thus indirectly confirmed that operators in the czech republic were not , in any case , not in favour of this idea . 
on the contrary , they are trying to do everything possible to that a potential competitor can appear . 
the group gts novera , which would take a new and not in order to become a real competitor of telefonika in the field of customers company , does not hide , long enough , its intention to launch a mobile operator virtual . 
" we are very keen to be able to offer our clients not only fixed telecommunications services , but also mobile . 
and the sooner the better . 
we have already led the negotiations on this possibility several times with the whole mobile operators czechs . 
with some , we have managed to make progress in the negotiations , " said the spokesman for the group pavel kaidl . 
the future is perhaps promising . 
according to unofficial information , it seems that maybe we could accommodate the first virtual operator already by the end of the year . 
but for the moment , its creation is accompanied by a total silence . 
" in this moment , we do not believe that there is a place on the czech market for a virtual operator as such . 
the czech market is in comparison with other very specific . 
for the moment , no matter provided a complex project and seriously in this area has contacted , " mentioned vlastimil sr≈°e≈à press department telefonika o2 , in its statement for mobil.cz. 
other operators are also refer to the nature of the czech market . 
the t-mobile spokeswoman martina kemrov√° says in a rare agreement with the declaration of o2 : " we have not recorded for the moment of project viable and bilaterally advantageous , which could serve as a basis . " 
and she added : " it is almost impossible for a virtual operator will appear in the t-mobile network by the end of the year . 
to operate in such a short space of time limited , we should have a concrete agreement now . " 
vodafone runs rather its attention on the performance of the requests to obtain its own 3g licence . 
miroslav ƒçepick√Ω said in relation to this : " we are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators , and especially in the field of expenses and shared infrastructure . 
this is what we believe , means the more contributions from the point of view of customers . 
the main strategy of vodafone in this area is the discovery of a partner to set up a network for a rapid mobile internet . " 
the authorities responsible : in phase with operators 
the approach of mobile operators is easily understandable , the entry of another operator would mean an increase in the competition , would have led to a drop in prices and therefore a reduction in their benefit . 
what good does so to facilitate the advent of such a competitor ? 
when it comes to their interests , operators can hear hand in glove . the harassment accompanying the creation of the u : fon witness also . 
the most pressure on the apparent ƒçt√∫ , the creation of the u : fon , has been that exerted by the company t-mobile . 
witness information accessible to the public learned of web pages of ƒçt√∫ . 
today , however , the u : fon is ready to serve as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator . 
martina kemrov√° noticed about this : " the competition on the mobile market has been , more recently , amplified by the entry on the market for a fourth mobile operator . 
given the nature of the mobile market in rt , it is clear that the entry of a player would cause further , and especially its services , high demands . " 
but given the attitude of the mobile operators , the indifference of the regulatory bodies czechs seems strange . 
however , it is not just the attitude of ƒçt√∫ , which , unlike britain and other developed countries , unfortunately did not , in the czech republic , the power to intervene in the economic competition . 
it belongs to the office for the protection of economic competition ( √∫ohs ) . 
however , this last adopted , faced with this problem , its position typical . 
" the entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question about renting the necessary infrastructure . 
no such agreement has been reached for the moment , because the supply of potential interested has not presented a priori enough interest in the traditional operators , " said in response to our question kristi√°n chalupa of external relations department of the √∫ohs . 
a statement made thus do not would surprise from representatives of operators . 
but from an office , which must represent the interests of consumers and between other also take care , that no-one will take advantage of its position on the market , such a statement is more than confusing . 
especially as kristi√°n chalupa adds : " abroad , where the virtual operators are normally present , we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to a fall in the price of mobile telephone services . " 
however , push in the direction of a functioning honest on the market and to lower prices is apparently not part of the interests of √∫ohs . 
what is shocking is the concorde almost touching the three mobile operators , which stems from their reactions . 
the question , if it is really a chance , arises naturally . 
in the same way , a price of petrol strictly identical to all service stations is probably by chance and the battle of the competition . 
" the office has not increased , in this subject , signs of a anticomp√©titif behaviour , it has no reason to intervene in one way or another . 
none of the operators has a dominant position , none has therefore a corresponding responsibility increased his behaviour on the market . 
the tools necessary to opening up the market for mobile virtual operators probably lack the telecommunications regulator , " said in its statement chaloupa . 
the interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of contention . 
of course , there is an analysis of the relevant markets , drawn up by the ƒçt√∫ that telecommunications are , in the view of the economic competition , a single market . 
none of the czech operators has a dominant position in such a market . 
however , some experts of the law are proposing a different view of things : for the creation of a virtual operator is possible , we must obtain , each time , the consent of the operator of network . 
and the mobile operator has understandably the monopoly on its network . 
this is the way it plays necessarily a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity . 
however , even without admit this argument , it should at least be worrying for the √∫ohs that three mobile operators are clearly in a similar way . 
however , the complaints many interested ( including society novera gts , already mentioned ) show that they are in negotiations with all operators , similar constraints . 
do the responsibility on the ƒçt√∫ is a pretty typical in communications , through which the √∫ohs is washing his hands of the case . 
we have already met this kind of attitude in several similar cases . 
we unfortunately has not managed to get in the nov√©lisation of the law on telecommunications , adopted recently , an extension of the powers of the ƒçt√∫ on the field of economic competition in telecommunications , although many specialists promised an improvement of the situation . 
this , the representatives of the √∫ohs must very well know , but their interests are apparently the other . 
when no one is looking , it can work 
that said , the operation of a kind of virtual pseudo operators , several in the mobile networks czechs , remains unnoticed . 
it is business publishing their own list of price of mobile telephone services , but these are only public in part . 
in most cases , it is a question of firms doing the multi-level marketing . 
mobile telephone service particularis√©s are thus proposed by example by amway starlife bohemia , telecom , and many others . 
the lists of prices of these companies are usually do that to the elected representatives . 
the magic trick lies in the fact that the business is before the operator is a client company classic , which commands a large quantity of sim cards . 
as a customer important , she gets offers of price ( and other ) special . 
the problem is that business conditions of all mobile operators czechs prohibit such a resale . 
" if there is what you suggest , it could be a violation of contractual conditions that we would look and could lead to a cessation of collaboration with the company in question , " has responded to our question on this problem kemrov√° martina . 
however , it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity was not able to responsible for mobile operators . 
especially in the case of three companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers . 
auncun operator , however , does not speak out against such a procedure . 
indeed , the activities of these firms provide non-n√©gligeables their profits , and , at the same time , as opposed to virtual operators real , they do not threaten them with their own marketing official . 
miroslav ƒçepick√Ω indicates the problems possible : " the law allows such speculation , however , the services of these businesses are used by only a percentage of customers negligible . 
in addition , they are forced to admit that the sim card in their phone is not recorded in their name , so they cannot have it fully , in the manner of ordinary customers of mobile operators . " 
however , it is precisely that should seem strange to ƒçt√∫ . 
in addition , there is another question on √∫ohs . 
if the mobile operators turn a blind eye to such a procedure , why blocking the creation of a virtual operator ? 
i must add that the √∫ohs has fairly broad powers to disclose such activity , and if he does not want to be satisfied with the explanations of operators , who said they had no idea that this would happen , their contractual conditions banning it . 
when we will not be the most expensive country 
as we have already mentioned several times , the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market has made a significant drop in the price of services . 
however , almost in all the countries of the virtual operators , the traditional operators tried , sometimes more , sometimes less , to prevent their creation . 
the arguments used by these were virtually the same - a market too small or too crowded , problems with the quality of services , etc . 
however , it is precisely at this level that intervened in the developed countries , regulators , who were not the interests of the mobile operators , but those of their clients . 
both by formal steps that by an informal pressure , they ended up getting the creation of a prime virtual operator , followed by others . 
unfortunately , the regulators czechs treat this issue in the way of a hot potato that are disposed of in the passing near to a target . 
following the experiences that we have , we cannot get rid of the impression that the confusion in the skills is in these cases more than beneficial . 
but let us not throw the english channel after the balls . 
if the information of the scenes say true and a virtual operator will appear soon at home , the czech mobile market resumes perhaps in movement . 
if one of the operators has accepted the creation of a mobile operator virtual √∫ohs will not that difficult to remain unmoved rejection ( to discrimination ) other interested . 
and we may continue to call on more expensive than in the rest of europe . 
the new czech anthem has four new versions . 
choose the best 
look the four achievements of the new version of the national anthem czech . 
on sunday , on the occasion of the day czech citizenship , prime minister mirek topol√°nek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem kde domov m≈Øj ( where is my homeland ? ) . 
the anthem has again been recorded by the orchestra of the national theater under the direction of ji≈ô√≠ bƒõlohl√°vek . 
we have four versions - with a solo singing masculine or feminine , an interpretation with chorus and an instrumental version . 
the song is assured by kate≈ôina knƒõ≈æ√≠nkov√° and adam plachetka . 
otakar jeremi√°≈° and jaroslav krƒçek are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem . 
you can listen to the four new versions on the server ihned.cz. 
bƒõlohl√°vek considers the czech national song as one of the most beautiful anthems . 
as he had already given before the ƒçesk√Ω rozhlas ( the czech public radio ) , he has chosen for interpretation of the solo versions of the singers with voices young and representative , which are marked and appreciated . 
" since the beginning , i was trying to take care that the two singers , as well as the chorus , have a good proverb , so that it is well understood the words , they sing simultaneous way , " he said . 
the czech national anthem will celebrate , next year , its 175√® anniversary . 
the song kde domov m≈Øj impact for the first time in 1834 on the planks of stavovsk√© divadlo ( the scene of the states ) in fidlovaƒçka ( school speech-day of savetiers ) , czech original josef kajet√°n tyl , accompanied by the music of franti≈°ek ≈°kroup . 
it became popular , and people have spontaneously appropriate . 
after the creation of the tch√©coslaovaquie in 1918 , the first verse comes naturally became an integral part of the national anthem . 
it demeura one of seven national symbols even after the creation of the czech republic independent . 
how sounds the " new " anthem 
public transport ( mhd ) will introduce prague , on wednesday , the chip in their ticketing system 
on wednesday , 1 october 2008 will be enshrined in the history of pra≈æsk√Ω dopravn√≠ podnik ( the agency pragoise transport ) as the date on which set in the subway , trams and buses the first passenger , who , instead of having a ticket by paper , will have in their pocket a coupon electronic . 
at the moment , it is accessible for roughly a hundred thousand people , owners of the card to chip opencard . 
passengers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days ( it will be valid from 1 january 2009 ) and both the register on their card to chip in the information points and the offices of dopravn√≠ podnik ( the agency transport ) , located in the underground stations muzeum , m≈Østek , n√°dra≈æ√≠ hole≈°ovice , andƒõl , roztyly , let≈àany , kobylisy , rajsk√° zahrada , kaƒçerov and luka . 
from yesterday , there is also the opportunity to buy the coupons on the internet on web pages of dopravn√≠ podnik : www.dpp.cz. 
more than four hundred people profit√®rent of service during the morning . 
those who will begin to use the online shop can forget definitively the tills in the underground stations , where they had until now trampling of impatience in long queues in order to obtain tickets in paper . 
indeed , they will buy their coupon by internet and we will see on their map opencard in one of the 13 mƒõstsk√° knihovna ( municipal libraries ) . 
" in these points contact , there is available to passengers a counter with trained staff , which will help them with the purchase by the internet , and more , will see the coupon that they bought on their card , " said the spokesman of the project martin opatrn√Ω . 
has side of libraries , it will also be possible to register the electronic coupons on the opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule of several underground stations . 
what are these distributors ? 
they are red , remind the machines compost the tickets and passengers have perhaps already noticed in the underground stations roztyly , budƒõjovick√° , i. p. pavlova , florenc and vltavsk√° . 
" today , the city has five , but by the end of the year , there should be eighty , " added opatrn√Ω . 
an automaton will monitor the coupon in the place of the driver 
vending machines which will operate from tomorrow , are easy to use . 
it is enough to introduce the smart card opencard and the coupon bought earlier will register itself on the map . 
the electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital , but also in the area around the city . 
has the suburban trains and the bus lines 300 to 499 , used essentially the inhabitants of commons bohemia central to gain access to the capital . 
" in the trains integrated into pra≈æsk√° integrovan√° doprava ( integrated transport of prague ) , supervisors are equipped with readers of cards , with which they establish the temporary validity zonal and coupons , " explained the control of tickets filip dr√°pal ropid organisation , who designed the hours of public transport prague . 
buses are equipped with suburban card readers integrated into the box of the driver . 
when boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the card to chip the driver , but it must also put the opencard in the appropriate place on the side of the box . 
this is how the driver control the validity of coupons registered . 
" in cases where the passenger would need to check the validity of coupons registered , there is nothing more simple to ask this information to the driver , " compl√©ta dr√°pal . 
passengers who do not take the suburban bus and does not remember the date where expires the validity of their coupon , can join to new vending machines , originally used to record the coupons on the map . 
that is , on the screen of the device , which will display the information on the validity of their document . 
the sudeten demanding a referendum in the usa 
the sudeten germans were in 1945 that ≈°umava is integrated in the united states . 
this is a letter submitted in the collections of the jihoƒçesk√° vƒõdeck√° knihovna ( the library scientific south bohemia ) . 
if we cannot be part of germany or austria , we want at least live under the bosses in the united states of america . 
in 1945 , certain groups of sudeten germans addressed supposedly in the us president with such a desire . 
this is between other a letter preserved in a private archive , which is now lodged in the collections of the jihoƒçesk√° vƒõdeck√° knihovna . 
germans ƒçesk√Ω krumlov pray in the letter the us president not to allow " ≈°umavsk√° ≈æupa " ( region of forest in southern bohemia ) - annexed by hitler under the munich agreement - went to czechoslovakia . 
" we have understood the situation and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that the american troops come on the german territory not in oppressors and enemies , but as liberators , " is written in the letter , signed " people , to which the fate of the ≈°umava close to my heart . " 
given that the rallying cry to czechoslovakia is allegedly promising - knowing the czech national character - that of brutality , attitude without respects , incomprehension , oppression and servitude , the authors of the letter pray the american president to take in its hands the protectorate of the ≈°umava for now and forever . 
" we cannot believe , that would give you this territory to a foreign state to us , that oppresses and destroyed minorities and who has contributed nothing to the victory of allies without taking into account the views of the quarter of a million people , " is written in the letter . 
the reason alleged for which the authors can not sign the letter is the fear of a desire for revenge " oppressors czechs . " 
if the us president doubted the opinion of the ≈°umava germans , it would only have to organise , according to the authors of the letter , a referendum in the region to establish if its people wanted to be part of the united states , or live under the bosses in the united states . 
although the text content in the letter can , given the current knowledge of the history of the post-war period , seem somewhat naive , according to some survivors , it illustrates the expectations of sudeten germans of the time . 
while the germans czechs should at least glimpse that the issue of their expulsion of the republic will arise , very few of them are avouaient such a possibility . 
some were waiting for the us and britain were going to get to the sudeten region a certain type of autonomy . 
others believed that they would remain simply czechoslovakia . 
the famous austrian journalist gustav chalupa , born in ƒçesk√© budƒõjovice confirms this . 
during the war , it was , as a german of ƒçesk√© budƒõjovice , engaged in the navy in the baltic countries . 
when at the end of the war , he was captured by the english and placed in the camp of capture of the region holstein , dozens of germans czechs were consulted to their learns czech . 
" they believed that once back home , czech their would be beneficial , " says chalupa . 
none of the germans captured who lived in czechoslovakia before the war was , according to him , that , following the bene≈° , it would be expelled from the republic . 
you do not thoughtful - you pay ! 
a campaign emotional address drivers 
the action road safety the more expensive in the history of the czech republic . 
a way to characterize the emotional media campaign that intend to launch , on wednesday , the ministry of transport . 
the office of the minister ale≈° ≈ôeb√≠ƒçek believes that it will discourage drivers of a dangerous behaviour at the wheel . 
this campaign costing 150 million will appear on television , radio , movies on the internet , but also on pamphlets . 
it should discourage the drivers of the conduct quick and drink-driving . 
but also remind them to take the belt before you start . 
it wants to particularly affect the conscience of young drivers , motorcycle , pedestrians , without forgetting the professional drivers . 
what will appear in the ads ? 
especially the personal stories that are going to attack the emotions . 
witness also the slogan " bloody " of the entire campaign : 
you do not thoughtful - you pay ! 
the phrase " you do not consider " is included in capital on the registration plate . 
then , in a pool of blood , there is the phrase " you paieras . " 
what should symbolize that you can pay of life a moment of inattention . 
the spots will " haunt " the spectators until 2010 . 
the ministry has inspired similar campaigns in the anglo-saxon countries , where we can see commonly images with drastic images of victims of accidents . 
he believes that this will lead to a reduction in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on the roads czechs . 
the spots were prepared by the agency euro rscg . 
the strategy of sugar and of flogging against drivers 
" what works with the drivers , it is the system of sugar and hard . 
for them , the sugar is represented by , for example , to save time , when they grillent a red light . 
the force , it is the threat of a fine or an accident . 
the risks need to be recalled to drivers , " said martin ko≈ô√°n , the psychologist transport to the hospital na homolce . 
that is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially the negative ads , believes the psychologist . 
the signs saying the danger to drivers are , according to him , already less efficient . 
" when a static panel which warns against a danger is installed , it will probably soon merge with the environment and the drivers will see the most , " signala ko≈ô√°n . 
olmert would make in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories 
ehud olmert , president of the provisional government of israel , is ruled in favour of the return of virtually all of the territories occupied in 1967 , including the west bank , east jerusalem and the golan heights in exchange for peace with the palestinians and syria . 
he made that statement in an interview published monday by the daily yedioth ahronoth . 
" we must reach an agreement with the palestinians , which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the territories occupied ( ) , or even all , " said olmert on a daily basis . 
" we will keep a certain percentage of the territory , but we will have to give the palestinians a similar percentage ( of israeli territory ) , because without it , the peace will not happen , " he added . 
it deal that the return possible includes east jerusalem . 
" anyone who wants to security in jerusalem , and above all do not wish tractors and bulldozers to crush the feet , as happened to one of my best friends , will have to abandon parts of jerusalem , " olmert noted , referring to the two attacks in the city , in july , in which several people were killed and dozens of people injured . 
according to the prime minister , it will be necessary to find a " special solution for the temple mount , the sacred places and historical " located inside the old city . 
" he who will want to maintain israeli sovereignty across the city will be forced to integrate 270 000 arabs . 
it will not work , " he stressed . 
retirement of the golan heights 
olmert also ruled in favour of retirement of israel from the golan heights , which is , according to him , a prerequisite for the conclusion of a peace agreement with syria . 
however , it also would require some effort on the part of damascus . 
" i do not propose to make peace with syria solely on the basis of a pension from the golan heights , " it signala . 
" the syrians know very well what they 'll have to give up to get the golan heights . 
they will have to abandon their current relations with iran ; they will have to abandon their relationship with the hezbollah ( shiite movement ) ; they will have to abandon the constant supports they accord to terrorism of hamas ( shiite movement ) , the al-ka√Øda ( terrorist network ) , even that of jihad ( holy war ) in iraq , " said the prime minister . 
issues that arise after the accident : the cabin in the because they are illegal immigrants ? 
the law ignores ; walking in a long distance because is banned . 
in the context of the tragic accident of the coach of society student agency near padua , italy , the question if the cabin and passengers can during the journey move inside the coach . 
" if we wanted to respect the law strictly and formal , the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on the traffic , " said the spokesman of the ministry of transport karel hanzelka . 
the accident in question , during which has died a host of 22 years old , was apparently caused by the driver of a truck which has crossed the path of the coach . 
the girl was at that moment , unfortunately , sitting next to the driver , on the seat the most dangerous of the vehicle , although it has at its disposal two other seats . 
however , the coach can have an accident , or curb so sharp , also at a time when the stewart serves coffee or distributes newspapers . 
what matters is if the coach is under its technical sheet equipped places standing or not . 
if this equipment for places standing is not approved , passengers must sit . 
coaches long distance student agency do not have places standing ; what has been confirmed in aktu√°lnƒõ.cz by the director of the company radim janƒçura . 
" it is a question that we have dealt with the ministry and , at the beginning , it prohibits any movement of passengers . 
then they have cancelled and we got that passengers can go to the bathroom during the journey on condition that they have their own seat " , it has unveiled its position . 
the law ignores the stewart 
" there is no clear legal interpretation of the role of stewart - no legal prescription is not of this role . 
on the other hand , no legal prescription does not prohibit either the carrier to offer services . 
the law on road transport knows just the term recipient of vehicle ; it does not define its rights and duties , " adds with more ambiguity hanzelka spokesman . 
josef pokorn√Ω , the director of the department of the movement of road vehicles , believes that , on the contrary , the law treats sufficiently the issue . 
" everything depends on the fact if the coach has in its approval permission to propose places standing . 
all lies in there , " he said . 
coaches are divided into urban , where there are places standing and a maximum speed intercity limited , with places standing and a higher speed and coaches long distance without place standing with the maximum speed and highest seats fitted with seat belts . 
as in the plane , said an expert 
jaroslav ho≈ô√≠n , an expert at besip ( road traffic safety ) in security in transport , does not see the movement of cabin on board as a major problem . 
" at a regular movement , there is no danger . the situation can be compared to that of the service in the aircraft . 
again , it is not sure when will happen a turbulence and the host of the air can beat your head . " 
" however , in the case where the coach would have slowed so sharp , the laws of physics would obviously be valid . 
in the same way that in a city bus or in a tram . 
the carrier must manage the safety of cabin by internal requirements , " he said , and also believe that the point of view of the law , the issue is not resolved . 
janƒçura is prepared to remove these services 
student agency is the only carrier to offer the coach cabin services . 
he recruited two hundred . 
even after the accident , the director do not consider their profession as a profession at risk . 
" nevertheless , once i have the impression that it is a craft at risk , i supprimerai . 
passengers can receive their coffee and their newspaper to boarding . 
it also would reduce the costs , " he said . 
the concern of security is the reason that gives the absence of cabin in its vehicles , the director of the asiana alexei litvine , which ensures that , in comparison with its , a very small number of lines . 
" we have no receptionists . we are opposed from the beginning . 
sooner or later it will end by a fatal accident , " he said , there is a years t√Ωden.cz. 
an immense tragedy came 
a young host the region of plze≈à , who worked for the company for two years , has died in the accident on the line of naples . 
a truck was probably the slovenian quit√© emergency stop without using blinker and it has blocked the path to coach . 
the driver of the latter to try to avoid it through a manoeuvre sharp , but he has come by his right side . 
janƒçura refuses that the two seats reserved for the rest of the cabin have been sold . 
" in the case of long-distance lines , it is not possible to reserve these places , they are blocked . " 
the company account complaint against the driver of the truck . 
for compensation to the girl 's family , the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court , but as regards the financial compensation , it also counts on the culprit . 
a change in the law ? 
not 
a change in the law , which is being drawn up for more than a year , by a group of 30 experts of the ministry of transport , could provide clarification about the movement of cabin aboard the coach . 
" however , it has not led to any conclusion on this point . 
indeed , it is not interested too buses , but rather to the points system , to the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the phone at the wheel , " said the expert ho≈ô√≠n . 
" the transport ministry does not consider the activity of the cabin as something that would fundamentally endangering the safety of passengers , " concludes the spokesman hanzelka , stating that the control of the security of coaches is under the power of the police and the office for security at work . 
the hopes of d√ºsseldorfois are based on frankfurt . 
great words were not lacking in the letter by the steering committee of the westlb , the employees of the home . 
by a union of entities from the financial institute of d√ºsseldorf with the deka-bank of frankfurt , " the central institution of the financial markets , the financial group of the sparkasse " could be , according to the letter made public monday . 
the westlb , would bring a " block of competence " doubled a sustainable productivity in such a case . 
after all , such a relationship could be the decisive kick-off to other mergers in the sector of banks l√§nder . 
this is what it looks like when a committee executive board is keen to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times . 
because the westlb , injured , is still a strong pressure . 
this is not only the european commission , but also the federal authority of supervision of financial services which has , it only recently , made it clear to the government of the land of rhenanie nord-westfalie of that time is running out in the search for a solution in the future . 
however , it is a question for a long time - also on the side of frankfurt - a relationship of any deka between the bank , who knows the customers of the sparkasse by their investment funds , and westlb . 
admittedly the head of the deta-bank franz waas signalled at the presentation of the figures for the six months ending august that he had no sense in the merger of the home of the mainzer landstrasse with a bank of land , whether the helaba or westlb . 
however the board of the deka , which each and half is borne by the banks of the l√§nder and by the groups of coffers of savings , commissioned the steering committee of leading talks with the westlb , for common commercial activities . 
it could then act in the flow of the financial market , or parts of it . 
the talks come , however , only to start , it is said in the financial centre . 
this is not the first time that the deta-bank , who , with his 3000 employees , account for one of the largest employers on the financial centre of frankfurt , comes into play when it is a question of consolidation in the sector crates of savings . 
in 2003 it was believed for a moment that the deta-bank could merge with the bank of the land of rhineland palatinate and halbab . 
nothing is yet come out of this ternaire mix . 
hardly the plans had they been made public that the government of the land of hesse was speaking out against any participation of the hellaba in them . 
subsequently , the other two houses either rejoign√®rent does not . 
the bank of the land of rhineland palatinate has been tied to the place at the bank of the land of bade-wuttenberg in stuttgart . 
but there was still new dealings on the reunification of the deka-bank with banks of l√§nder . 
finally , g√ºnther merl , chairman of the steering committee of the hellaba , however , was made against any commercial strategy of merger with its bank . 
regardless of that , the feeling seems spread that the amalgamation of the various institutions of the public sector is particularly urgent . 
now that the election in parliament of the land of bavaria is passed , a union of bayernlb with the bank of the land of bade-wuttenberg could come in first . 
for the helaba , this is not particularly good news . 
if the pressure which obliges new mergers should increase , the possible partners escape him . 
in the south , it now would be a junior partner , although it has so far weathered the crisis that banks in munich and stuttgart . 
the grouping of savings banks and transfers of hesse-thuringe , which owns 85 percent of the capital of the helaba , on the other hand , has drawn a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with the westlb . 
will remain nordlb rigour . 
such thoughts geo-strategic does , however , that one of the facets . 
another facet raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can be matched . 
in june , merl stated that the decisive issue , namely thanks to what business model the future ability of banks l√§nder should be assured , had not previously resolved by the german grouping crates of savings and transfers . 
eventually , a carve-up of the westlb , could take place , carve-up which here is obviously not wanted . 
it is also what it is in the letter to the committee executive board in place : in any case , would be referred to a " globale' solution for the establishment . 
how this will all be lumped together with the union of certain entities with the deta-bank remains to be seen . 
the second weekend of the festival of the beer is also known as the weekend of italians . 
for elena , this is the first time , for luca already the third or fourth time . 
but this time , elena accompanies it as a girlfriend , and , therefore , nothing is the same , he says . 
behind them , almost a barrel five litres of beer brand kaiser , is a bearded well built which shows around 200 visitors to the celebration of beer what sounds profound its gosier can produce .

three buses are reserved mainly for the italians , in one of the bus travel of br√©silens exclusively . 
in a corner of the parking lot , the south americans sing already alongside their flag , they have already celebrated last night . 
and as noisy , explains marco guarda , this is not for the italians . 
the bus belongs to marco , who wears a long coat doubled false fur and glasses frames for the broader silver eels . 
for five years , they go to the celebration of beer , already three treks this year alone . 
they go there at night , remain the day to the party , and returning to 10 . 
spend the night would involve unnecessary costs , explains marco . 
the trip costs 75 euros , including the pot of welcome with a beer brewed kaiser , according to the law of bavarian purity , health insurance and a group official speaking german - marco has done a language courses in frankfurt . 
and already buses roll in the night on the autostrada direction " brennero . " 
there is no beer , not yet . 
quickly , everything becomes calm in the bus , passengers sleep . 
it is better that way , they will still need their forces . 
the breaks will be made to bressanone and holzkirchen , while a large number of other buses with italian registrations plates are again a pause shortly before munich , on the highway 8 . 
when in the morning , the group of marco is finally coming to six hours 30 as planned on the parking lot near the place th√©r√®se , nearly 50 other buses across europe are already there . 
elena , luca and the other congregate , marco takes one last speech , explains the plan of attack . 
first : hair of the small yellow hat . 
top is writing to the left " celebration of beer , " gothic in , and to hand the internet address of the travel agency of marco " conoscersiviaggiando.it . " 
secondly : " when the doors of the beer tent open , there is , " shouts marco in the early morning . 
'courir ! " run and push the places at the bottom of the tent . 
'pas before , otherwise it blocks , and not all the yellow hats on the same benches , it must be the spread in the room ! " 
the chope , shouts marco , costs 8.25 euros . 
and do not forget the contest ! 
'montrer the security officers that we behave well ! 
as soon as you leave your seats , they are parties ! " 
third : " this evening , be back here has ten and a half hours pile ! " ? 
and it is , it went to the celebration of beer . 
on the road , someone would enter into yellow hats to the trees to return to the path , the panels and even a election poster of a major party bavarian popular . 
it is to be ready for the return . 
this is the second weekend of the festival of beer , known as the " weekend of italians . " 
there are no precise figures ; we talk about 50,000 who put themselves at road through the alps and collapse in the kiosk to beer , 10 percent of the visitors would come on purpose of italy this weekend . 
the police munichoise is reinforced by seven police of the south tyrol transit forum , by rescuers italian volunteers who support the bavarian red cross which carries out a statistic about the countries where the italians occupy the first place before the british ( 60 speeches ) and the austrians ( about 80 ) with almost 200 medical interventions . 
that is particularly appreciated italians , this is the tent of the brewery hofbr√§u . 
nights of insomnia for shareholders of hypo real estate 
the german banking system is relatively stable , insisted the federal finance minister it was only a few weeks ago . 
what chance that the politician used the word " relativement' and that it was sliding that the german banking sector would not be spared by the movements of crisis . 
it is indeed occurred this weekend . 
the financier of the bavarian housing hypo real estate ( hre ) , one side in the dax , gets to a consortium of german banks credit a billion to protect themselves from turbulence in the markets . 
a person in the confidence of the situation told reuters on monday that the aid commitments are issued up to a total of 35 billion euros . 
the hypo real estate should now paying interest on the fraction on what it would thus have law . 
the money comes as many private banks that banks of public law . 
in the background , it is the soci√©t√©-fille depfa bears the losses . 
the financier of state was , according to a newspaper article , refinanced in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible for the fact of distrust of the markets . 
in the first half of 2008 , the liquidity reserve the bank had been reduced by 95 percent to 2,37 million euros , the rate of capital was also slightly wavered of 1,6 to 1,45 percent . 
the profits and net those from financial transactions were , compared to the same period last year , fell to the point zero , the profits from the allocation of debts and securities determined and the termination of provisions in the operations of credit had fallen by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros . 
and it is only due to large profits from reimbursement of costs of accounting downstream from the restructuring of the former group depfa , as well as the interest payments , according to the book of fiscal procedures and commercial purchases for businesses konzern that the deficit of the gains of around 16 percent turned out to be moderate . 
after its privatisation in 1990 , the former financial state had first badly speculated on industrial credits estate , which then had been filialis√©s aareal to the bank . 
because the financing of typical state was not enough profitable , the depfa then had committed more intensively in infrastructure projects , and in the financing of projects in common between private investors and state ( privat-public-partnership , ppp ) and diverse internationally . 
on the value of the soci√©t√©-fille , hypo real estate needs to amortization of which should have on the calculation of the gains and losses of the group an essential material which remains quite vague . 
the fact is that dividends have been cut off . 
already for 2007 , they had been truncated two-thirds . 
the hypo real estate is , since the purchase of the depfa , an investor of state and infrastructure highly important . 
it is more robust than other institutes refinancing dependent on the market inter-bancaire since it has no submission of customers . 
with the collapse of the investment bank lehman brothers two weeks ago , the allocation of funds between banks again significantly exhausted , banks having accumulated their liquidity . 
the hypo real estate needs annually for a part - about 50 billion euros - of all the money the depfa a means for short-term refinancing . 
according to a statement from the hypo real estate , the need for funding the group is covered with the credit in the medium term and the company protected the influence of financial international markets largely out of works now . 
other sources say that the refinancing would be secured through the funds until the end of 2009 . 
the president of the committee board of hre georg funke explained that the group hypo real estate should no longer have to resort to financial markets in the medium term . 
the federal reserve bank and the federal establishment for the supervision of financial services ( bafin ) assume that the group 's ability hypo real on the market is now guaranteed . 
shareholders and creditors of the bank no longer have to hope . 
however , in view of the dynamic and impond√©rabilit√© of the crisis , there is no certainty . 
this is not unthinkable that it should not use the funding in all its breadth . 
but the opposite either cannot be ruled out . 
after the fact that the bank is , according to the latest releases , yet the doors of the insolvency sunday at the end of the evening , this rescue for the provisional less will not be able to reassure the minds either . 
the course of action collapsed 75 percent to 3,30 euros . 
the prices of bonds , however , are particularly well . 
while the debts primarily have barely budged , loans from second flagging plan . 
most affected are especially investment funds of the old soci√©t√©-fille w√ºrttemberg hypo and those of course which have a life beyond 2009 . 
the obligations of the bank hypo real estate previously seemed to be a placement of alternative speculation , now their value should be seen as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net tightening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute who has brought the crisis in the establishment by the takeover of the bank depfa . 
as long as the emission institutes , governments and commercial banks less affected are still prepared to support the system , we can assume a narrowing of arrears in time . 
or will happen that no one would dare to hope at this time - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the 15 months . 
but with the noises renouvell√©s a partial nationalisation , the likelihood that approached the soundness has now become a mere hope based . 
this should reserve nights of insomnia , above all , the long-term creditors on the decision whether to secede from their commitments . 
short-term investors can still use what they have drawn a line to be a postponement of the losses for the next few years on the next tax on incomes of capital stock market gains automatically levied . 
sylvana and the secrets of the box to bento 
when sylvana hiltrop , 16 years ago , must be present for the first day in highschool of tachibana , girls are beginning to giggle laugh : the german is so " kawaii " ! 
what it means ? 
sylvana already knows this word thanks to the mangas - in his new log of exchanges , it speaks of japan . 
" the first day of japan . 
what i was excited . 
already the way to go to school scared me . 
i live on the outskirts of tokyo in the direction of kawasaki and i take the train 40 minutes until the highschool of tachibana . 
i find the road alone , fortunately i am not lost . 
the beginning of the courts do not seem to be set so strict that home in lower saxony . 
the pupils are one after the other from eight hours , until nine hours least 20 , a round table discussion begins with the teacher , the " home room . " 
but before the course begins , it was up to me to appear . 
i am not the kind to love speaking to people , especially in front of a class of 40 pupils . 
as i had not yet the uniform of the school , i put an old skirt host of my mother , and a shirt , socks and blue up-and-coming black leather shoes . 
in this place , so i was before the rostrum , and have tried all pronounce properly : " sayonara wo she sylvana ... " - i call me sylvana , i come from germany and my birthday is in a week . 
at this point , i was very pleased to have started to learn the language there two years ago . 
the 31 girls of the class were all whispering , pouff√© laugh and fact of signs , and i have consistently heard the word " kawaii . " 
i already knew through my mangas . 
it belongs to the vocabulary essential to the survival of japanese teenagers and means " cute , cabbage . " 
then i quickly crept to my place . 
the girl beside me made me a great ironic smile , she found that it was an honour that is relevant to sit next to it . 
the rest of the time was fairly calm , but when the falun gong has roiled , i have been attacked in the rules . 
everyone talked to who better better , pouffait to laugh and i raised many questions - in this case , it is quite difficult to understand japanese english . 
during the break , they will then have all come out bento them . 
my foster mother had also done this kind of lunchbox - it is really something other than the paltry snack germans . 
i had of rice to the aromatic herbs , small sausages , a cucumber salad and algae , fruit and a kind of meat surrounded by tofu . 
most of the time , i have no idea what i eat exactly here in japan . 
things have a bizarre appearance and a completely new taste . 
what is certain is that everything is really good . 
well , except perhaps plums , salt confites brrrr ! 
the bentos are not only lunches in japanese schools . 
sometimes that a girl offers a boy a bento she has prepared itself , which is then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of being able to do a little better knowledge of the boy during the break . 
i read it in my mangas . 
i am curious to know if i could see also here . 
" why japan in particular ? " asked me my girlfriends when i told them that i wanted to spend a year in school in tokyo . 
i then always responded : 
" because it fascinates me , what " 
in the end , read mangas , this is what i prefer already for years . 
and in order to better understand the mangas and culture which is , at a time , i also started to learn japanese . 
for me , it was really clear that i had to travel one day . 
because i also have a low for the traditions , the customs and customs . 
and here , we give them a lot of importance . 
on the one hand , japan is the country of technologies and latest trends - on the other hand , it is tough , disciplined and traditional . 
and like everything is so well organised , i never felt lost here , even if tokyo is the largest city that i have ever seen . " 
rats also have sensations 
a rat or a cold turkey fled before the danger , is it means that he feels also fear ? 
the neurophysicien joseph ledoux is convinced that many animals have also sensations . 
but how can anyone verify that it has the same thing when he behaves in the same way that we ? 
in the magazine online " edge , " the contributions are published for several years by famous scientists . 
spiegel online present in a series of articles for answers to the question " what do you think be true without being able to have proof ? " 
i believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else has until now could prove just as you cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience . 
but in this case , we can at least hope that all human brains are the same configuration . 
as soon as we turn to other species , and that we are dealing with the issues of felt or in general of consciousness , we are moving into the difficult terrain because the hardware is not . 
when a rat is before a danger , he did the same thing that many other animals : it is the death , fled or attack . 
the human beings behave the same way , that is why some scientists deduce a subjective comparable . 
however , i do not believe it . 
two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our subjective experience to that of the animals difficult . 
one of the aspects is that the circuits involved almost always on human consciousness lateral include the prefrontal cortex ( the fact of its participation in the short-term memory and in senior management and implementation ) . 
this vast region is much more developed in humans that in other primates and seems to be entirely absent among other beings . 
all the less so for these aspects-ci our conscience who depend on the prefrontal cortex , including the conscience of who we are , and the ability to predict and decide , it is reasonable to assume that the human being differentiates even of other primates . 
another significant feature could reside in the linguistic nature of the man : a large part of its existence is linked to language , this often means that his conscience depends on it . 
in this case , one could exclude the animals . 
but even if the conscience should not depend on the language , this one certainly influence , so that the animal awareness , regardless of how it is produced , would differ probably a lot of most of our states of consciousness . 
that is why it is also difficult to determine what may seem like the conscience in other animals . 
if this , internally and subjective , leaves and measure or , the fact of this particular hardware , analyse based on our own experience , then its observation we have big problems . 
most of my developments make reference to the content of the experienced aware , but there are next to another aspect of the conscience who should be more easily accessible scientifically . 
you could look at the process of conscience of animals without taking into account their content , and that is exactly what happened at studies on short-term memory of primates , particularly with the example of the visualization . 
but in this approach that followed christof koch and francis crick , it focuses more on the nerve correlations of consciousness that on the mechanisms triggers : the two may be identical or not . 
curiously , this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal cortex in the achievement of the visualization . 
but what it result for the emotions ? 
i conclude that a system of emotions such as fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activity . 
what we call as " fear " is so the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity the defence system embedded in the brain ( or its follow-up , as the reactions of the body ) absorbs the memory sharp . 
and observed , emotions are closely linked to the regions of the brain that characterise primates and particularly the man . 
subtle degrees of felt , associated with our nature voluble come , because we can , with the help of words and grammar , differentiate and categorize the states for the blame to others . 
in contrast , antonio damasio , for example , believe that the sensations from primitive activities are born in the regions of the bodily sensation of the cortex and the brain stem , like jaak pankseep which , however , focuses more on the brain stem . 
as this network is not much changed during the course of human evolution , it could quite part of cross-cutting sensations of all kinds . 
from a purely theoretical point of view , i can not contradict him , but i believe this to prove . 
pankseep argues that what is as fear among men and in rats is probably also felt as such in the two cases : how could anyone yet check if rats and men feel the same when they behave similar ? 
a cold turkey fled before the danger , but if he felt fear ? 
in my view , similar are not enough to prove the experienced identical . 
admittedly , the comparison nervous aid : rats and men have similar brain trunks , cockroaches by against do not possess even a brain . 
but is the brain stem is at the root of the sensations ? 
and even if you could prove that to the man : how can the show in rats ? 
i believe that the rats and other mammals , perhaps even cockroaches ( who knows ? ) have sensations . 
but i do not know how the show . 
and because their wrists probably differ from completely ours ( since human consciousness is based on special circuits and on the language ) , i prefer to explore the emotional behaviour as the sensations emotional rats . 
in all cases , progress poignent on the nervous plan as it gauges the same thing in rats and humans . 
as i is not exploring the language and the conscience in rats , nor the sensations , i do not know if they exist . 
we could judge that as the in the short term , but i prefer to move rather than beat me constantly against a wall . 
i am indeed a √©motionel pragmatic . 
platini , the president of uefa : a grace period for poland and ukraine 
the deputy prime minister iwan wasjunik explained that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister . 
" the government considers uefa 's decision to bordeaux as a sign of confidence in ukraine and in its ability to organise , in collaboration with poland , the european championships , " announced wasjunik . 
" but this is not an amnesty for our country . 
the work has just begun , and there is still much to do in the two countries . " 
in the timing of the construction or the destruction of stadiums , streets , hotels and airports , the two hosts run after the deadline . 
the number of stadiums for the championship of europe could possibly be reduced from eight to six . 
" we cannot lose any more time . 
we need to work on the maximum speed , " said the president of the ukrainian league grigorij surkis . 
" uefa has constantly in the eye . " 
an even more radical was decided in poland . 
the direction of the polish football league pzpn has been suspended by the national olympic committee after many scandals and replaced by robert zawlocki , independent director . 
the commission met on the request of the minister of sports miroslaw drzewiecki . 
" there is a real danger that the pzpn would not be able to act in the rules , " said drzewiecki of the polish news agency pap . 
" we have assured in a letter to the president of uefa that preparations for the european championship in 2012 do not suffer . " 
several members of the league first division were already in the previous season , sentenced for manipulation of relegation compulsory ; in the end , the start of the league has even been mismatch at the last minute . 
dennis quaid outraged counter-attack 
she wanted to make the promotion for a new film , spoke of his private life in an interview - and now has trouble with his ex : the hollywood star meg ryan has lifted the veil on his ex adult√©rin quaid dennis . 
it foam - and counter-attack . 
a war of the late pink for former couple meg ryan and dennis quaid : seven years after their divorce , the two hollywood actors are waging a battle disgracieuse - in full view of the whole world . 
last week , meg ryan expressed in an interview with the american newspaper instyle on the causes of the failure of marriage : " dennis has long been unfaithful , and it was very painful . " 
it would have taken note of the extent of the deception only after the divorce . 
the reason for this striptease thinking lies in press relations of ryan for his new film " the women " - is told the story of adultery . 
the reaction of dennis quaid on its qualification of unfaithful husband fell clearly : it would be " monstrous , " said it " the new york daily news , " 54 years , that " meg rem√¢che again the history of our relationship and manipulated . " 
this would be more " regrettable , " that " the sentence , and the changes that include a divorce for every child be new rekindled in public " for their son of common 16 years jack . " 
while ryan lives only since the divorce quaid , got married again and will soon become the father of twins . 
so was his response to the coup of claw : " in any case , my life continues . 
i am happy to have a wonderful family that goes to the better . " 
the price of airline tickets and hotels fall 
in the first half of the year 2008 , the flights and the nights of hotels were cheaper than the previous year . 
in germany , according to a current study , flights would be even reduced to 50 percent . 
the flights and the nights hotel would be returned to advantageous - it is the result of a study of the service provider of financial services and american express travel . 
the company has analysed data bookings in the first half of 2008 and has established , after a rise in prices in the first quarter , a sharp fall in profits in the second quarter . 
after prices on the market , hotels have increased over the years , the nights of hotels have already reduced in many places . 
from january to march , prices rose in 41 of 48 european cities examined still 6,9 percent on average in comparison with 2007 in 41 of 48 european cities examined . 
from april to june , prices were , however , already 3,6 percent lower than the previous year . 
the trend was clear especially in paris and rome , where travellers should paid 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier . 
the causes of all this r√©sideraient for american express in the low value of the dollar which has led to a " desire to travel in fall of tourists americans . " 
financial markets , such as frankfurt or london would be even more affected by the decline in the price of hotels that industrial sites as hanover , cologne or stavanger . 
in the swedish city , prices hotels are taking place with a rise of 26,3 percent , the highest in europe . 
also in the price of flights , the trend was on the rise in the first quarter : 
the fact of the increase in the price of jet fuel , passengers in economy class have pay on average 7,1 percent more than in 2007 , the long-haul flights , very consumers of fuel , have even increased until 29,2 percent . 
from april to june , the price of tickets in economy class have fallen by an average of 12,5 percent compared with the previous quarter , business class and in first class however , variations in prices have been far less pronounced . 
in germany , prices have fallen even more important than in other european countries : 
from january to march , prices had risen 11,9 percent , in the second quarter , they have fallen 23,6 percent . 
domestic flights germans have even been divided by two according to the study . 
the reasons for this fall in prices would be on one side a slowing economic growth , explains the firm . 
the request succumbed to the ground in a market segment of travel by plane . 
on the other hand , it would be a greater pressure of the competition by the treaty " open skies " which liberalises air traffic between the united states and europe . 
sign of the tense situation is the removal by the airlines of non-rentables journeys , as well as the high number of airlines that have filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - they were 24 airlines in europe alone . 
hsv taos gladbach 1 : 0 . 
with a purpose and simple methods , the sv hamburg becomes prime the ranking . 
in the borussia luhukay , still has not managed to find a eleven functional . 
of kristoffer klein . grow . landing in disaster for international player marko marin . 
the player of gladbach tucked only late in the game and its sights lifted fell against the framework of the goal . 
his message was made , it was out of his lips persuasively . 
he knew that he was right . 
" we need this second goal , " siffla rieger hermann in the hallway of the changing rooms of the arena of hamburg . 
it was not happening a lot in the changing room , half-time was over and most were stale in their place . 
rieger was for nearly three decades the physioth√©rapeute of hsv , it has a great reputation as well as former players . 
and that is why his request was received to strategic places . 
the assistant coach cornelius jol has acquies√© and lifted the thumb to approve . 
cornelius is the brother of the coach in head of hamburg martin jol . 
whose orders seem to have been similar : and it jumps with this second goal ! 
the practice has missed . 
" everything was not very nice to see today , " confessed later marcel jansen . 
bastian reinhard would " liked to also be more relaxed " . 
this 1 : 0 ( 1 : 0 to half-time ) , the team of hamburg the needs to be a victim of the successful head by mladen petric ( in the eleventh minute ) ; and the fact that the very low gladbach players could not do harm to low hamburg players . 
" it has been a dirty victory , " summed up jol marine . 
the sv of hamburg will celebrate on monday its 121 years . 
already saturday afternoon , the fans are celebrated themselves , the blue sky above the fray and paintings of provisional rankings on the giant screen that showed their club as the first of the class . 
it 's going to be a birthday without genuine celebration . 
" we know take a step back , " said marcell jansen . 
it is clear that the outcome reflects more through the picture the unpredictable nature of the premier league that the dominance of its hsv . 
the team with its arrivals late committed - the brazilians neves and silva , the guardian of aim petric like jansen profligate of fc bayern - are , admittedly slowly , but it is not yet . 
" we need more charm and more dribbles " , demanded jol .

the dark matter influence the flight of space probes 
for years , a mysterious phenomenon leaves the researchers in the confusion : the dark matter influence the speed of space probes during what we call the antics of gravitational support . 
experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct . 
for almost 18 years ago , the space probe " ulysses " fly in space . 
the fact of fuel conductions soon frozen , the death cryog√®ne the threat . 
for years , a mysterious phenomenon is cause uneasiness among researchers - the anomaly of the gravitational support . 
the gravitational support is a manoeuvre of space probes , by which they get an extra boost in the gravitational field of a celestial body , the earth for example . 
thus , the probes can save a lot of fuel . 
the probe of research am√©rico-europ√©enne cassini-huygens used this trick physical , just as the ulysses solar probe . 
this is what surprised researchers elsewhere for years : the flying objects are not always 100 percent of the way is according to the venerable laws of gravity . 
much more , irregularities appearing at the level of speed . 
the probes are becoming unexpectedly faster or slower . 
until now , physicists could not explain this . 
they baptis√®rent the anomaly of the gravitational support . 
some experts fear that the theory of general relativity , albert einstein , who described the pull of the terms of the fact of the curvature of space , might not be entirely correct . 
the american physicist stephen adler of the institute for advanced study in princeton still believes hard as iron that einstein is not wrong and trying to explain the anomaly of the gravitational support to the aid of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe . 
" the dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly , who is also close to the earth , " he writes . 
researchers in the area are aware of the existence of dark matter only for about ten years . 
it stems , apparently it an attractive force whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies . 
it , however , is completely invisible , meaning that it sends nor reflects no electromagnetic radiation , especially any visible light . 
according to the calculations of scientists , the dark matter would be a good fifth of the mass of the universe . 
tourists kidnapped in egypt are free 
after ten days at the hands of kidnappers , tourists kidnapped in egypt should be freed and the minister of foreign affairs confirmed the italian . 
the sudanese kidnappers had demanded a ransom of several million euros . 
during the shooting before the release , six hostage takers have been killed . 
in southern egypt , five germans have been abducted . 
the negotiations for the ransom would already be underway . 
the germans are constantly in the sights of kidnappers . 
welt online paints the most important cases . 
european tourists kidnapped in the sahara are obviously free . 
it is this that have communicated together state television of egypt , the arab television channel al-arabija and the italian media . 
the italian foreign minister franco frattini confirmed the release after the ballots of the italian television channel sky tg 24 : " our citizens and other hostages have been released . 
we are in the process of verifying their state of health , " said frattini . 
the five germans , five italians and romania and their eight companions egyptians are doing well and are safe , announced the egyptian national television . 
the 19 participants of the excursion into the desert should already be en route to cairo . 
the circumstances surrounding a shoot-out before the release of the hostages still remain unclear : thus , the kidnappers would have been close to put an end to the kidnapping , according to a security officer of egypt , before the sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without warning . 
" the problem was resolved . 
they agreed with a ransom , " said the agent . 
it was not only to collect the hostages , " when suddenly , " this surprise " occurred . 
sudanese soldiers shot this sunday , six of the kidnappers in the border area between sudan , chad and egypt , and had arrested two of them . 
the hostage takers had demanded a ransom of germany to a total of six million euros ; the money must be called by the german woman of one of the hostages . 
the newspaper " el masri el jom " said that , in the words of an ombudsman german , the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety . 
according to the article , the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after the payment of ransom . 
the men were to be held until the kidnappers have found a safe route to escape . 
the german embassy in cairo has refused to make any comment on this story . 
abuse of a father , " which led to the suicide " 
a court has been informed that the years of abuse inflicted by his father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide . 
michael trerise , 57ans , stithians , in cornwall , has been jailed for six years after he admitted eight counts for ways of facts disgrace . 
the tribunal de grande instance of truro has referred it regularly linked its step-daughter here , stephanie randle during his childhood , 5 to 7 years . 
trerise wrote in a letter to confession : " i feel responsible for his death . " 
the tribunal has been told that ms randle , aged 34 years , committed suicide in her home to mutley , plymouth , on 1 april 2007 . 
child when she lived in coventry , trerise had committed and bandaged before the force to sexual acts , while his mother worked at the pub . 
trerise and his wife have divorced in the 1980s , and he returned to live in cornwall . 
its step-daughter here went to plymouth . 
but the court was told that ms randle , assiduous voluntary national trust , was haunted abuses that had been inflicted two times a week . 
the prosecutor general , ramsey quaife said in court that friends had been told that ms randle , which was a good surfeuse and cyclist , seemed since 2006 " emotionally dead , " and " had lost all hope towards life . " 
in april 2007 , its true father , terrance randle , was found dead in his apartment in plymouth . 
we believe she committed suicide in suffoquant with a plastic bag . 
mr randle affronta the father-in-law of his daughter , who had also , drafted a letter of confession who was finishing up : " i attached and the bandais regularly . " 
" i have not abused her sexually . 
" i feel responsible for his death . " 
the judge christopher elwen told trerise : " you 're really weird as abnormally attached , your victim should be terrorised certainly , especially at the age of 7 years . 
" this saga unpleasant ended with the suicide of the victim . 
and what is even more surprising is the fact that if it had not committed this gesture , its history would certainly never over the court . " 
he added : " i would stress in particular , such as the describe his father and his mother , the effects of your crime had made for years on stephanie . 
" without them , it would undoubtedly be today a young woman happy , promising , and success . " 
conviction for loss of official data . 
the officer ministerial cabinet office who had forgotten the documents top secret , in june on a train , will be condemned by the official secrets act , has managed to the bbc . 
the man of the ministry of defence was travelling when it oublia two highly classified documents on a train in the direction of waterloo . 
the documents are gone in the hands of the bbc before being handed over to the police .

the bbc correspondent , frank gardner said that this episode was a lot people whitehall . 
" they have thought that this case would be remained between the walls of the ministry of defence and the cabinet office , " he said . 
the employee who cannot be named , is accused of breach of the 8.1 section of the act , in other words , the clause that deals with the protection of information . 
.le crown prosecution service has suggested that the ministerial officer is placed under the tutelage of the metropolitan police , given the highly sensitive nature of his work linked the committee associated with the secret services

the building societies face the bill b & b. 
the british companies of the building may have to pay a bill of more than ¬£ 80 million , to cover the rescue of the bank bradford & bingley . 
the government has provided ¬£ 14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million savers of bradford & bingleys . 
the interest of this loan will be paid by all companies who collect money from savers , including 59 societies of the building . 
the director general of building societies association ( bsa ) , adrian coles said he is " irritating " to know that the companies and their members will have to pay the bill ... 
the loan of ¬£ 14 billion will be reimbursed when the mortgages of bradford & bingleys are released . 
but the interests that will increase at the same time , will be subsequently charged , every year , to 700 financial companies who collect deposits . 
the financial services compensation scheme has confirmed to the bbc , that the 59 societies of the building are included in this list . 
it is irritating to see that the institutions that have been prudent behavior ... must now pay some of the bills of the institutions that were much less prudent . 
adrian coles , bsa 
it says that every society must pay a sum proportional to the deposits that it holds , and that the intermediary companies must pay about 18 % of the cost . 
the treasury believes that the interests of the loan will be in 2009 , to ¬£ 450millions . 
this means that companies will have to find ¬£ 81 million to settle the interests of the first year . 
adrian coles , director general of the trade committee of companies from the building , told the bbc that this decision him seemed unfair .

new investigation in the case of the us prosecutors . 
the lawyer , us general has appointed a special responsibility to check the question of the dismissal of nine us prosecutors in 2006 . 
everything is born of the reporting of the case of the inspector general of the department of justice , which criticised the actions of certain ministerial officers . 
the report was critical of officers of the white house , legislators and the former attorney general , alberto gonzales . 
the investigation is based on the theory of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes . 
the accuser special , nora dannehy investigate now to know whether the officers interviewed during the investigation , who lied to the investigators , obstruant and justice . 
" serious accusations of potentially criminal conduct , not based , have not been fully confirmed nor resolved , " said the inspector general , glenn fine , in his report . 
the appointment of a special accuser able to force witnesses to table , was one of its biggest recommendations . 
the dispute starts by radiation in december 2006 of nine us prosecutors made by the department of justice american . 
at the time , the department had said that prosecutors were made redundant because of poor performance . 
but it emerged then that prosecutors made redundant were not more criticism that their other colleagues , prompting some observers to give these redundancies a political connotation . 
some prosecutors have been accused of being close to the republicans in congress , while others have refused to investigate about accusations of fraudulent vote against the democrats . 
american prosecutors investigate and continuing the judicial authorities to the government . 
it is certain that they can be fired at any time , but cannot be for political reasons .

a number of cabinet officers of the department of justice have also given their resignation . 
the report by the inspector general was very critical of the role of mr gonzales in this case , saying that it considered " first responsible " of these redundancies , and ends up by " surrender " its leading role , " managing remarkably not involved in this case . 
other cabinet officers , including former collaborator of bush , karl rove , have been criticised for not having managed to cooperate in the investigation .

the rock star meat loaf , must be honoured at the q awards for his epic song bat out of hell . 
the singer , who will receive an oscar at the ceremony in london , next week , said to be " honoured " to achieve this recognition . 
the song nine minutes and 50 seconds , was the title of the hit of the yearbook , meat loaf of 1977 . 
the evening of the prizes is presented by coldplay , with this year , a selection restricted to four categories . 
paul rees , editor of q magazine , said : " there are songs that transcend things like the time and kind , and bat out of hell in fact certainly party 
the song , written by jim steinman , required a great voice as that of meat loaf . 
it begins with an instrumental section that has lasted almost two minutes . 
the song was put in trade in the united kingdom , as single in 1979 , according to the 15th place . 
in addition , his record bat out of hell has remained nine years in rankings english , and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide . 
meat loaf- or marvin lee aday , its true nom- has suffered from health problem in recent years , suffering even an operation to cure his a heartbeat become irregular , after collapsed on stage , in 2003 . 
in 2007 , a strong laryngite was forced to cancel concerts . 
then he found a cyst in the vocal chords . 
a dark street in the city , often forgotten , and can be sold soon . 
new york has hundreds of avenues , boulevards , streets and other parallel roads , some famous , others only functional . 
. and even some taxis veterans as well as local residents of long date do not know to give guidelines to go to extra place , because they have never heard of . 
the street is in the east village and travels the northern first street- not to be confused with second street- between bowery and second avenue . 
about 30 feet wide for 120 long , it looks like a dusty alley rather than an active artery . 
. some signs indicate the street . 
it is virtually impossible to find on a standard atlas . 
this street , however , have admirers . 
for example , there are avalon bay , the manufacturer of the recent luxury buildings on first street . 
he would like to repaver extra place , and create a more fluid passage to the shops and shops , which should open in the new buildings . 
other admirers including long-time neighbours , said to be happy with this shortcuts simply because it remains one of the last and more old streets of the block of houses . 
but the department of housing preservation and development of the city that manages the street , has no interest in the bear . 
this month , at a meeting of the committees of owners of neighbourhood , representatives of city agency and avalon bay have outlined a proposal authorizing the manufacturer property to buy the street . 
but the committee would prefer that the street remains in the hands of the city , and has asked for a new proposal to submit next month , said susan stetzer local , the manager of the committee no 3 . 
" little remains of spaces belonging to the city , and we would hope that the city retains extra place , " she said . 
" they could offer to restore and manage it , which incidentally avalon could do , but we want to maintain public . " 
avalon bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repaver the small streets and install seats , some are also used by a coffee in which the manufacturer will lend money space . 
the proposal this potential acquisition was made public in the meeting of this month . 
michele of milly , the door floor of avalon bay , said that although the company intends to exploit the street , this does not necessarily mean that she wants to be the owner . 
" the main interest of avalon bay is relooker this aisle abandoned , and make it public , " she said , stressing that it was the city to suggest the sale " . 
seth donlin , a door floor of the preservation of real estate , has confirmed that the city wanted to sell them well the street , also stressed that the agency 's mission was to develop the property rather than the handle . 
compared to its neighbour more colourful , bowery , extra place has left a slight historic footprint . 
some believe that extra place bears the name since 1802 , when the legacy of the great firm of many children of philip minthorne was split , leaving aside this little piece of land , which remained since abandoned . 
the entry after the cbgb monument , a 17-year-old punk rock closed in 2006 , has re open to extra place ; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photograph on the cover of the yearbook ramones " rocket to russia ! " 
" this place was beautiful , " said danny fields , the manager of ramones , which took the photograph in november 1976 . 
it was full of scrap yard , ragged , barriques , posters , leaves and strings . " 
some residents , including the bloggers who had already talked about evolution towards the luxury of the east village , opposed the idea of selling extra place , saying that this humble small property should remain public . 
others have proclaimed extra place as a true raret√©- a snippet virtually identical to the city that should be damn in peace . 
jeremiah moss , who led a blog called jeremiah' s vanishing new york ( subtitled " the book of protests : a nostalgic bitterly on a city in the process of extinction " ) tells the story of the city and outside place , published in 1952 in the new yorker . 
the author , brendan gill , wrote : " extra place is a small cul-de-sac close , dark day and night , and defined by the doors of a warehouse in a rusty iron and persiennes , full of newspapers last week that soars along the goutti√®res . " 
has few exceptions , the street has always the same pace . 
a rat short agilement at the bottom of the alley , almost a door which led to the cbgb once , and which has now become the headquarters of a clothing store . 
the graffiti on the walls , a bottle of beer 22 ounces empty , rests with newspapers that have just been thrown away . 
a few passers-by said thinking that rarely to extra place , and suggested its value . 
mr field , for his part , said that some under believed the attractiveness of the street in its current state . 
" the best years of my life , " he said , " were held in dark places , wet and disgusting . " 
the debate : bilingual immersion in the english language 
in this part of the programme of supervision of education , bruce fuller and lance t. izumi discuss the position of the candidates about education bilingual . 
lance t. izumi , a former member of the studies in california , and former director of the department of education to the pacific research institute for public policy , is the co-author of the book " not as good as you think . why the middle classes should be able to choose their school . " 
to curry favour with the hispanic voters is a complicated business . 
the proposals of barack obama on education are an interesting example . 
the campaign of mr obama stresses that " latino and african-american students have less chance of dipl√¥mer that students whites . " it is a fact truthful . 
to combat these differences , the education programme , mr obama supports in particular , among many other subjects , " education bilingual transitional " for those who are learning english . 
however , the question for obama is whether its desire to achieve a bilingual education , which defends the instruction in languages other than english , goes beyond its interest to eliminate differences . 
take , for example , sixth street prep , an elementary school in the east of the county of los angeles . 
the students of this school are overwhelmingly hispanic , and low incomes . 
more than a third of the students , made up of many new arrivals , is studying english . 
among the students of the fourth grade , 100 % have past the examination of state of math of 2008 , expert level . 
similarly , almost 93 % of students have spent examining anglais-de langues-d' arts 
this incredible success was achieved through another ingredient as that made by mr obama . 
sixth street put on analyses , practice , a constant assessment of capacity and an exemplary attitude . 
in addition , and this is an example that mr obama could copy , recounts linda mikels , principal of the sixth street , this school has introduced the instruction of the english language " full immersion . " 
the total immersion in english language focusing on the almost constant use of english in the investigation . 
ms mikels , contrary to the bilingual education , has affirmed " we have had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from mexico , 12 months after that , if you went without his class , you would have had no chance to identify it . " 
" this works , she observed , " has market for us " 
mr obama should it not take example of the sixth street prep and replicate in other schools made up by a majority of hispanic students learning english . 
the excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves , but the policies on education within his party ( the associations for the national education have long argued the bilingual education ) and its huge support for bilingual education , obscure the predicts the response from mr obama . 
although it is in favour immigrants learn english , mr obama has recently seen this issue as insignificant , when he proclaimed that we should all stop arguing about the wording of the laws in the english language . 
" on the contrary , he said , " you have to ensure that your child speaks spanish . " 
if mr obama really wants to eliminate the differences , then it should consider carefully , the models of education that work , rather than dismiss or consider them as insignificant . 
net fall of oil in the wake of the new concerns of the world economics 
oil prices have fallen sharply on monday , because people fear that the rescue plan for the financial markets , will be able to breathe new life into the economy . 
futures trading of crude oil , fell by 7 percent arriving at 99.80 dollars a barrel . the new york mercantile exchange , during the sales of this morning . 
prices have fallen by more than $ 20 a barrel since last monday . 
these last two weeks , the markets for raw materials have been buffeted by the financial turmoil on wall street , as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the gulf of mexico .

the news was assuaged by the recent concerns that the crisis would be durative . 
in the latest episode of this financial catastrophe , " citygroup buys banking operations of the wachovia corporation , said the government on monday . 
at the same time , the governments of belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg have in party nationalized the european financial conglomerate , fortis . 
analysts from barclays capital have said that the frenetic negotiations this weekend , concluded with the agreement of rescue " do not appear to have managed to revive the market . " 
while the economic situation is d√©t√©riorasse , demand for commodities , oil included , should slow down . 
" the overall vision of fairness , interest rates and exchange of markets , became uncertain , " wrote analysts at deutsche bank in a letter to their investors . " 
" we believe that the raw materials will not escape this contagion . 
" in regard to the raw materials , our most pressing concern is to understand how far the virus american diffuserait-il globally and in particular , china . " 
analysts in the bank have reduced their expectations for the next year , given the fall in consumption of oil due to the slowdown in economic growth , were therefore obliged to decrease 20pour cent , forecasts of oil and gas prices for 2009 . 
the festival of the second time crucial to improving the record equipe . 
after having spent during the past eight seasons , more time than anyone in uniform jets shaun ellis , the defender thought have all seen . 
he looked at the second time , when the jets transform√®rent a 0 to 0 in an explosion . 
" i have never seen anything like this , " said ellis . 
the second time began after the jets and the arizona cardinals have filthy played under obscure clouds . 
then the quarter back brett favre has managed to pass to laveranues coles touchdown allowing a 12 yards , sign a after 12 noon during which their relationship has made a leap forward . 
favre found coles for two other touchdowns , the first when a corner fell back and the second , to 10 seconds of the half . 
" i am not out of my zone " favre said about all its passes to coles . 
" this is a poor player " 
" we can communicate extremely well , despite what people think . " 
while favre coles and played a catch , the defense would beat the quarter back of cardinals , kurt warner . 
darrelle revis , corner back , has intercepted a firing lost , and made 32 yards until touchdown . 
eric smith did another passes and was intercepted . 
linebacker , david bowens left escape the ball because of warner . 
the last change , the loss of the balloon of bowens , could well be the most charming 
the cardinals have taken control of this possession for the last 10 seconds , and then the jets got the ball , jay feely did a goal of 20 yards taking an advantage from 34 to 0 . 
it was the best that the jets were able to score at a time . 
" the jets coach eric mangini , who were asked to describe this madness , said " the second or third time ? " 
when he was told the deux- the jets missed unquestionable 21 points in the third temps- mangini said : " i can tell you that i have more appreciated the second time that the third . 
" . many points have been marked by little time . " 
gebrselassie rested , exceeds his world record . 
haile gebrselassie , of ethiopia , has again been proven to be worthy of his title of best long-distance athlete of the century , after having beaten his own world record in the berlin marathon on sunday , becoming the first to run 26,2 miles in less than 2heures and 4minutes . 
with a victory in 2 : 03 : 59 a race accommodative stance on the dish , gebrselassie defeated 27 seconds his record of 2 : 04 : 26 , contested last year in berlin . 
35 years ago , gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his successful career during which he has won the world cup or the world record for any distance , the 1600m√®tres of the marathon . 
last month , gebrselassie had missed the olympic marathon in beijing , craignant- can be so exaggerated in the eyes of today - that air pollution could increase its asthma . 
on the contrary , it promised to run in berlin . 
in conditions almost parfaites- time sunny , 48 degrees at the start , 55 to the arriv√©e- gebrselassie won sunday , now an average impressive a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds . 
the runners of runway as gebrselassie and paul tergat , all kenyans , converted into two runners in substance , have contributed to the reduction in the record of the marathon of more than two minutes in the last ten years , since 1998 , when the brazilian ronaldo da costa won in berlin in 2 : 06 : 05 . 
after the victory of sunday , gebrselassie said the reporters have suffered the calf tapering. two weeks before , and have missed training for a week . 
it is clear that the rest has enabled him to remained bright , but not rusty . 
" i am so happy , " he said to reporters . 
" everything was perfect . 
i am called last week , and today , i had my doubts ; but in the end , it all went for the better . " 
he was reproch√©- especially in kenya , the rival is the african ethiopie- have too orchestrate its shopping , avoiding the global stars of the marathon , relying on the hares as if they were in a competition of runway , and considering the more world records that the sense of the competition . 
but this criticism does not diminish the greatness of the capabilities of gebrselassie as a runner of substance . 
gebrselassie sunday , preceded by four kenyans , recorded a time of 1 : 02 : 04. to e path . 
two elite runners kenyans , james kwambai and charles kamathi continued to defy gebrselassie after the head of queue have missing . 
a little over three miles of the arrival , gebrselassie made its final push to move away from kwambai , which ends up second in 2 : 05 : 36 , improving the best record staff of five minutes . 
kamathis is coming third in 2 : 07 : 48 . 
in the women 's race , irina mikitenko , born in kazakhstan , now a german citizen , has completed a remarkable year obtaining the seventh time of 2 : 19 : 19 . 
the english paula radcliffe holds the world record of 2 : 15 : 25 . 
the last spring mikitenko aged 36 years , has surprised everyone winning the london marathon in 2 : 24 : 14 . 
it could not take part in the games in beijing because of a hypothetical back ache , but promised to win in berlin , improving its third marathon , his personal record of almost five minutes . 
it ran making use of a clever strategy , leaving the group of runners ethiopians and kenyans take a good advantage , the then exceeding about 18miles ¬Ω after . 
askale tafa margasa ethiopia came second in 2 : 21 : 31 , while helena kiprop kenyan , an 18-hour , third in 2 : 25 : 01 . 
in a city to hand , the pride and the trials of black life 
hidden in the development of its huge park , a few miles of the sunshine , the brilliant and the giant orlando , is a quiet little town where the pride and the complications of the african american experience . 
" eatonville , first city black entirely to integrate , house of childhood of zora neale hurston wrote , this description that it did in 1935 , is not so simple to do nowadays . " the town in five lakes , three short of croquet , 300 skin pigmentations skins , 300 good swimmers , full of goyaves , two schools and no prison . " 
it is now a city of pilgrimage 
alice walker , tony morrison and ruby dee came to the zora festival every year to eatonville , to pay tribute to , the writer hurston wrote the most famous of the harlem renaissance . 
and in different ways , the city that it d√©crit- tourist has become , thanks to its inclusion in the tour guide of the florida edited by the depression- era federal writers' project- remains a place apart . 
it is also independent , dignified , private and that it was already in the 1930s , when told hurston wrote that the rural population blacklist of florida was often reluctant to share its true thoughts with the white man , which " we knowing so little , does not know what it loses . " 
even if it is the year of the election of a black president , senator barack obama , who has also invoked an open dialogue on the issue of race , many here remain cautious of gaze from abroad . 
" we are very careful about how to tell the story , " said hortense jones , 59 , resident for always and the oldest paroissienne of the city . 
" it must be in line with reality . 
eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting . 
it is both a historic model a takeover of blacks as well as a community of almost 400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average . 
it is a central point but also an example of black rural culture sudiste- a few times scorned , other times acclam√©e- that recalls the birth of the american slavery . 
which explains why the residents are both proud and protectors . 
the interest in the image of eatonville born with zora , that everyone here calls hurston wrote . 
she ran his hometown at the world through books sincere , full of dialect , such as " mules and men , " ( 1935 ) and " their eyes were watching god " ( 1937 ) . 
five paragraphs in the guide of the florida transform√®rent this city , situated right at the exit of route 17 , a road that runs through the centre of florida , often forgotten , which in black chapter of history and the human tragedy . 
such bold a big box in life as in literature , hurston wrote led the readers to the store of ownership of the first mayor of eatonville , joe clarke , who was then divided into several private parties . 
" the road on the left , " writes , " you 'll find the modern public school brown and white , with its gardens and these playgrounds well maintained that howard miller has always taken care , although it can barely read and write . 
it did in addition mention of new husband to widow dash and wrote that lee glenn " sells drinks of any kind and everything that can be used to people . 
so , in just a few hundred words , hurston wrote to a combined eatonville auto government but also to the analphab√©tisation remarried at , and sex . 
of course , fodor was not so . 
it was not in fact a portrait that everyone appreciates . 
zora has described the reality , " said ella dinkins , 90 years ago , one of the young girls of johnson that has immortalised hurston wrote , citing the songs without color , interpreted by men who have recognised their beauty . " 
she added : " some people have not appreciated . " 
we remember always hurston wrote as a person live and eccentric , who had frequently after his family has moved to he went to jacksonville ; fla . 
augustus franklin , 77 , rappela hurston wrote that was usually in a city without warning , aboard a big chevy , a cigarette in the mouth and wore trousers here , where even today , we are proud of the traditional clothes . 
many residents were fascinated , mr franklin said , while many were making fun of it . 
" people were always happy to see zora " he said . 
but he adds in addition , swinging in his chair of the patio arse which gives on lake sabelia , where hurston wrote was certainly christened " it was never too long . " 
has the death of hurston wrote in 1960 , it was poor and his books were outside production . 
eatonville and the world seemed to have forgotten . 
although it was once a star of literature , a contemporary langston hughes and the only black woman of barnard college years 20 , she was buried in a tomb , with strong pearce fla , where she lived . 
has eatonville , no great commemoration , or plaque for the general public . 
i do not think that they have understood the contribution or the legacy that she offered in the world , " says val√©rie boyd , author of " wrapped in rainbows hurston wrote a biography of published in 2003 . 
a crucial moment came in the 1980s . 
of public officials of orange county wanted to build a motorway to five channels , in town , to replace the boulevard kennedy , main street to two lanes of the community . 
the development of orlando has already prompted interstate 4 until the angle west of the city . 
the proposal was made while eatonville was just a difficult period in its history . 
a forced integration , among many things , has put an end to the isolation relatively idyllic community . 
in the 1950s , the dispute on the mix of races have led the hatred to the gates of the community . 
" to this time , a gang of young whites came launch of oranges or objects against the people sitting on the side , " said mr franklin . 
" a lady is even died . " 
they launched a watermelon their car . " 
in a letter from 1955 to the orlando sentinel hurston wrote , casts doubt on the request of the supreme court to a forced integration , defining its decision in brown v. board of education " insulting rather than glorifieuse of my race . " 
residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools , that is positive in some respects , has diluted the cohesion of eatonville weakens and has the confidence of the young . 
" black children used to be embrass√©s- i remember welfare we 'd kissed our master in the morning , and the evening as " said n.y. nathiri , daughter of ella dinkins as well as director of the preservation of the community of eatonville , a group not profit . 
it lasted , she said , until the moment where the teachers and students do more came from the same place . 
" you do not embrasses tone white teacher because it is blanc- i want to say that there are here , a dividing line culture , " said ms nathiri . 
the civil rights , moreover , have helped to create space for many other zora neale hurston- black writers , actors and artists who went in addition to the damage , as it , army of a cheery confidence own and lines such as : " how can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company ! " 
it is beyond me . " 
in 1975 , the writer alice walker went on the grave anonymous hurston wrote and began to fight to revive its reputation . 
five years after , a biography hailed on hurston wrote carried out by robert e. hemenway , a true best seller , the r√©introduisit and cannons , americans . 
the project of the motorway happened just when the girl the most famous eatonville had recovered its appeal . 
and this time , the old neighbours of hurston wrote regard as a sauveuse . 
the community has started to organize a festival hurston wrote to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that would create the motorway . 
hundreds of fans have come to the opening of the festival after two years , and many are returning in january , to commemorate her . 
after many years , the told has rejected the proposal of the highway . 
" the fiasco of the motorway to five ways , extremely rapid , a genuine civic pride , " said ms . nathiri . 
ms boyd summarised the all stating that " zora saved eatonville . " 
the victory against the project of the motorway has enabled him to change his own image . 
people non-resident , as rachelle munson , a lawyer who frequent depuis1993 our church , began to come in large numbers , and residents were beginning to reconsider the past . 
eatonville is classified historic town since 1998 . 
a library mono renowned theme ( of course ) ouvra hurston wrote in 2006 , on a magnificent kennedy boulevard , repav√© . 
today , eatonville remains an anomaly for florida : to six miles of orlando , it can at any time is seen as a back street later during a day of summer rain , small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the years 1880 . 
( there are now 90 percent of blacks ) 
foreigners who come to discover the story of eatonville , its right to be , are still treated with caution . 
we need to ask permission for most of the interviews , and some choses- as the walls of the old church of eatonville , painted by the white man , illustrating the black men in the champs- must not be photographed . 
much to eatonville , as ms jones , a brave teacher and which has a low for the bright red , have always fear that their island community is not well understood . 
however , given the expansion of the festival hurston wrote , a certain level of local pride is emerged . 
young people in particular , tend to view eatonville as hurston wrote considered its entire race : beautiful , problematic and all , neither better nor worse , but also proud , creative , bosseuse , crazy and mixed as the other racial and ethnic groups in america . 
this is a civic sincere affection in the voice of the nephew of mr franklin , edwin harvey , 18 , who plans to return to eatonville after the college to work for the local government or for police forces , who need additional forces . 
and even for younger people , as alondra and alexia kenon of 11ans , twins of winter park , seem to have learned the description eatonville properly . 
" most people , who spend in this zone there , will think : " oh , this city has nothing compared to other " alondra kenon said after the mass on sunday . 
but if you stop and take the time to look at the history , it is a very beautiful city . " 
here in new york , all speak fluent in finance . 
despite all this , nothing has changed . 
if tourists in manhattan were held away from the newsstand and giant tv screens in times square , they do not make that they are in the eye of the storm . 
ever they might think that in the offices glass and nest of bee over their head , bankers and managers of hedge funds who hold new york , spend the worst " working day at the office " for crack cocaine of 1929 . 
suppliers continue to slip on the sidewalks , with their trolleys and their bistro muffins for meetings matini√®res . 
the latino still roam between the residential buildings , as the mules , 50 luxurious shirts hanged a yoke prepared on its shoulders . 
the employees of office continue to line up to buy their sandwich matinier retailers , and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 16h and 7 in week . 
i had not felt the crisis despite the stories completely pessimistic until this afternoon when i decided to go open a new account of savings . 
luckily i planned to work at the end of the afternoon , as i discovered to my local subsidiary of jp morgan chase , a dozen people queuing . 
not before the counters of cashiers , or to withdraw the species or make a payment , but before the one-stop shop of customer service , where the usual customers demanded their checkbooks , tourists were the direction for the store macy , and new customers were opening of auditors . 
most of those in front of me , i learn later of starr , my " banker staff allowed " , were all the tail for the same reason that me . 
not in the same way , because they had already withdrawn their economies of the smaller banks , such as those of new jersey , pennsylvania , and staten island . 
they have withdrawn their money of auditors of savings so-called thrifts ( such as a society of the building ) , associations of credit , and the kind of local savings banks and their subsidiaries , which only work in a state , and who say deal with customers and their families . 
in a recent past , 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt . 
these days , washington mutual , a bank in the capital of $ 327 has made use of the receiver of bankruptcy , and while the new yorkers returned to their home for the weekend on friday evening , another bank , wachovia , the savings accounts to a value of $ 440 million , d√©sesp√©ramment sought a buyer for the save . 
the bureau and the employees of stores that are in front of me , fearful of a potential another debacle , have transferred money to a bank that their seems reliable , is the one who made the most rescue to wall street . 
of new yorkers any became very familiar to the world of finance in recent weeks . 
" i heard a lady in my local supermarket chinese , talk on the phone of lehman brothers , the bank that went bust , and his meagre director general dick fuld , with the same familiarity she may have to criticise a colleague . 
and lyn , the uniformed doorman in my building , has changed the subject of our normal conversation about brad and angelina or deliveries of my fruit and vegetables . 
she said , following my visit to the bank . " i put all my savings in the market for money-market funds . 
" i have changed , i do not want to take risk . "

please america less without paul newman 
" the time god creates the perfect people 
paul newman was part of that . " 
this sentence is the actress sally field , who has worked with him in " absence of malice , " and illustrates the despair of american cinema , and the whole of america , in the face of striking idea that newman is not of this world . 
he had trouble getting an oscar 
it was more since 2007 . 
everyone knew that he was ill . 
this has been a blow to everyone . 
" sometimes what one feels exceeds any expression , and now i have lost a great friend , " robert redford crying , " my life and my country were best thanks to its existence . " 
no one had scared to go ridiculous or exaggerate . 
one of the fathers of cinema and the homeland died during a particularly dark , where the terrorists and the stock markets are afraid , the feel of americans fell well below , desperate for reasons of dignity . 
when times are so tough and without reason to live , there is the human beings that admiration and it is not necessary to be luis cernuda for love paul newman . 
it embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth . 
it was the enemy of richard nixon and the defender lost causes and defeated as the foundation for the anti-drug fight created in honour of his mother died following an overdose and the creation of its own brand of organic food . 
this was a victory for a country that has had trouble prevail against a suicidal food culture . 
this wave of admiration expansive balayait hollywood without attention or the nationalities or the passports . 
the latest james bond , english daniel craig , noted that no james bond died before him . 
another english , the oscar-winning sam mendes , said that work with newman marked the height of his career . 
the bad boy arrived from australia , russell crowe , dared appoint newman as his greatest inspiration . 
" he has set the bar high , " said george clooney , which is perhaps the only today , which is trying to break the screen as did paul newman : being very honn√™t and having a private life serious and far from the objectives . 
it is not always easy or possible in the jungle of our days . 
but there are those who try , and paul newman is one example . 
after a divorce , it has been married fifty years joanne woodward were to which he has been faithful even if the opportunities do not miss him not to be . 
" but why should i eat a hamburger outside my home , if i have a beef steak in my fridge ? , " he used to joke . 
in the sky , it is with pride to the meeting of his daughters with its fans on earth , something that is not so usual in america . 
" among all the major roles he has interpreted , it has never been so proud that the dedicated husband , father , grandfather considerate and philanthropist , " disent-il . 
madrid in the race to host the olympic games 2016 
and yes , the dream of many of us is that madrid can organise the olympic games , after the failure in 2012 , this could be achieved by 2016 . 
but i wonder if we are ready . 
if we take the example of the race yesterday : we are not ! 
they call it the perfect race , but to me it was the worst race to which i have never participated . 
if they had taken into account all the mistakes that occurred during the race , they would be subject to a note √©liminatoire . 
but look at everything in detail , and from the beginning . 
the errors are starting with the withdrawal of dossards , which forces you to go ahead . 
this is not bad but if they do you move it would be better that they give you everything ( including the electronic chip to the races ) . 
well , not 
they were you go there , only to take the dossard ( first mistake , travel only for this ) and ( after a long queue ) surprise ! , there was that the size 's " for the jersey ( second mistake , because i need a size xl ) 
in what world are we ? 
was it due to the crisis that they decided to buy that indeed small size with less fabric and suddenly cheaper ? 
well , this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the races . 
apart from the fact that we need to go very early to withdraw the chip , the queue is 15 minutes , and it must leave his backpack at the entrance . 
the wait lasted more than 35 minutes , it is incomprehensible since 11.000 people are expected for these races . 
since there was a long queue , competitions have begun , and we had not yet left our backpack to entry , although once done , the withdrawal has been worse . 
in addition , the rain has accompanied the expectation of more than 40 minutes during which have taken place rebellion and blows of the park . 
i believe that around 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow , and some people like me , not figurerons not even in the classification with the exact time , because of the chip that they gave me , which i think has not been properly the start . 
of course , if they were asking me to mention an example of a perfect race , i would certainly not to the idea . 
and i believe that we can always dream to become the host city for the j.o. 2016 . 
microsoft is seeking a virtual ( receptionist )

thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces , " the receptionist " can know how many people there are in the place , which they are - including remember what posts they occupy - and listen and hear the key words of their conversations . 
but also the group together in groups of conversation 
in the video presentation , the receptionist detects a third person , but she understands that it does not belong to the group who is speaking with it and that it is not part of the company . 
she asks him if she is to visit someone and she says that she will respond in a few moments . 
all this without the blue screen . 
impressive . 
but that , of course , is the future . 
now the company has other things on which to focus on , for example , the next version of its operating system , windows . 
this week we talked in more than a change of strategy at microsoft . 
windows 7 will be lighter , and it will no longer have as many programmes associates . 
steve ballmer , has found that if the computers were sold with the necessary instead of applications unnecessary , they would go five times faster . 
this represents a discovery since microsoft , version after version , has not stopped added functions and " extras " to windows . 
the change of strategy is welcome . 
microsoft is right , its operational system loses importance but also its software . 
when google 's chrome happened on the network , i was one of those who joined the theory that google 's chrome is the first step on the part of google to compete with windows . 
several people have rightly pointed out that an internet browser is not a workable system . 
the operational system will always be necessary because it is the essential basis for the hardware and the software to understand . 
it occupies the same office that your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law . 
that is true . 
it will never die but we must see the " death " of the operating system , not as an absolute truth , but as a truth is relative . 
this week , ballmer confirmed this idea . 
people are less and less attention to the operating system , but increasingly to the internet browser . 
you turn on the computer only to turn firefox , explore or chromium and every day people spend more time browsing the internet that to go windows . 
has that serve half of applications provided with the system ? 
who can most , can the least . 
and windows 7 will contain fewer applications , much less than vista . 
less heavy , months congested , less complex . 
for the moment , microsoft is more interested in the launch of its own services online so that they will finally become an alternative to google . 
they desperately need this , in fact , and i show you an example . 
the photo present in this article , was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the rooms of rest reserved for employees of microsoft to redmond . 
on the distributor of drinks , a poster their request to use their own research tool - " ta research . our future . " 
in 2006 , a study concluded that 66 % of employees of microsoft used google to look for information on the internet . 
last week a delay occurred in the new version of windows mobile 7 . 
it will not be at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010 . 
microsoft will surely to launch at the same time windows 7 and windows mobile 7 . 
the phone , after all , looks increasingly like a computer . 
but the launch of android being delayed and the iphone is already on the market , it will cost them dear .

pablo picasso the assumed on the c√¥te d 'azur , leonardo di caprio bore a in the " blood diamond " of edward zwick , even that al pacino in " the godfather " of francis ford coppola and is part of the holding of the association of gay heavy-handed . 
and if we are to list all his appearances , we could also cite this moustachu strapping which raise weight in a travelling circus . 
this is not just a swimming male body in cotton , milling and without sleeves . 
the english called " tank' but the fabulous marcel of brussels stands out among all the others . 
first of all , by his name flamboyant form of power - although it is known as " marcel " - which has to do with sport since it takes the name , according to legend , the boxer marcel cerdan , a lover of the singer edith piaf .

but attention , because the belgian brand does not only that the tank tops . 
but it also produces sweatshirt boxer , old fashioned , cardigans in kashmir , cotton trousers , babies , mini-shorts ... 
clothes , designed to comfort of underwear . 
even if it is a pity to wear only as underwear . 
they have too many charm . 
" i want to become a young mother ; the candidate does not worry me " 
its huge resemblance to her sister has not prevented to develop its own personality .

since i am tiny clothes liked me ; i d√©sirai go to my grandmother to watch in the wardrobe of my aunt and to see its clothes . 
it was cool , almost better than to go to the amusement park . 
then , when i became a dancer , i was trying always take care of my way i dress . 
the dancers like dressing up for courses and tests , to look in the mirror and feeling good . 
and in the role of actress , when you endosses clothing at this point that you really in the skin of the character .

so , think you become ma ? 
of course , i want to become mama because my body wonder , and i want to become a young mother ; i do not want to lose it . 
with regard to the candidate , i do not worry . 
what i will do that is to give a lot of happiness to my son and to raise it with a lot of love .

the people that naomi is a person at the heart strive . 
they say many things about it , i know , a lot of things are not true . 
in addition , this if good side of naomi fascinates me . 
she asked me for marching to a cause if noble , but if she was asked to do the poirier , i would have done anyway . 
the important thing is to make life better for women in the third world . 
repeat offenders of alcohol at the wheel will have to install the system alcolock' " 
the interior minister is that the driver , who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcohol , has to install his vehicle in a system that prevents start the vehicle in drunk driving , or if it does not blow . 
the initiative has already been announced last june and it is now in the report of the minister of state in which this initiative is regarded as a pilot project that will last a year . 
its purpose is the reintegration of the driver in him proposing of road re-education . 
the state minister in charge of road safety but also the general direction of road safety and the technological institute foundation for the safety of the car will be involved in this initiative . 
according to the statistics , between 30 % and 75 % of motorists arrested for having led more than once in drunk driving , takes up the car . 
the alcolock would prevent this , since it is a plug-in system on the vehicle which is a measure of the rate of alcohol in the breath and prevents to start the car if the driver does not blow before ; or when the driver 's alcohol level is higher than permitted . 
its cost is higher than 1.000 euros and is in charge of the driver . 
in this respect , a study in the united states in 2007 showed that vehicles fitted with this device were driving up to 65 % of offences during the first year of installation . 
and in spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year . 
this measure is that the administrative penalties for two reasons : face these behaviors before they turn into criminal offences . 
and facilitate its implementation , as the legal reform can be made by ordinary routes but , however , the reform made by criminal channels requires a reform of the organic law . 
the device is not yet available on the spanish market in any form of trade , although some industrial vehicles and function in already has a to experimental title . 
precisely tomorrow , congress members will vote an initiative of the spanish socialist party , which proposes to install in the school bus this system as it has been in france .

talk in sleeping 
a few children speak during the night . 
i am not linked to those who woke up very awake in telling us something that happened the day before , but children who speak in their sleep . 
the first time that this happens it may surprise you , but in reality it is not important . 
it is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquie . 
it is quite common , especially among children and adolescents . 
it is sure that there are more of a talking during the night . 
this phenomenon can appearing very sporadic ( once in life by example involved in an episode of high fever ) , or a more regular ( all the days , once a week , once a month ... ) , the day after the child does not remember nothing . 
there is no single cause which determines its appearance 
they are often linked to other alterations of sleep as the nightmares , the night terrors , the late-night √©nur√©sies ( to wet the bed ) or the sleepwalking , but this is not always the case . 
as we have said before , they can also be associated with very strong fever , to situations of stress or become agitated . 
anyway , it is a phenomenon little studied . 
the intensity with which it happens is also very variable . 
it may be that he speaks with a small , quiet voice , with isolated words , whispers or instead with the cries , crying , long speeches ... 
in the case where the somniloquie becomes very frequent , it would be good to see the child and to consult a specialist , to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and in order to get an explanation to this problem . 
we have said that it is a benign alteration , that is why there is no treatment , unless it is linked to another alteration of sleep that can be treated ( for example , if it is linked to a sleeping apnea or stress ) . 
what we can do is take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as : 
try not to excite the child before going to sleep . 
therefore seeking quiet games and avoid programmes or television series that are more or less violent . 
with children very nervous and who have trouble relaxing , relaxation techniques can be used to help calm internally . 
this will allow the child to have a sleep more peaceful . 
as soon as the somniloquies appear try to stay calm . 
you remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day it will remember most of what happened . 
useful advice 
do not wake up . 
it is useless , since it is unconscious and you r√©veilleriez . 
although he is talking about , he sleeps and relies so . 
you remember that if it is very anguished several times , it is advised to consult a doctor or to check what causes both anxiety among the child . 
if you understand what he says ( which is not normal ) , have not the temptation of the question to obtain information . 
you do not get it , because in sleeping , it is not aware to arrange its thinking . 
in addition , you 'll hear what he says , but you will not know what it is in the process of dreaming , suddenly made attention to the way in which you interpr√©terez information and the conclusions you draw from this . 
never tell to the child that you can ask him during the night to know its secrets . 
not even jokingly . 
this causes a lot of anxiety . 
in conclusion , do not worry , this is nothing of nasty , it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes . 
finally illhaeusern ... 
illhaeusern has finally found the way to the victory on his ground after a long period of famine . 
without making a great match , the yellow and black have created the largest number of occasions and have managed to turn a for the gain of the match . 
the pace was not very supported during this meeting where the attackers have struggled to speak . 
after a first attempt of the captain visitor kauffmann which teetered on the edge of skylight on a shot by far , illhaeusern would take slightly ascendancy and in turn fonderflick far , then with hirn above roman , the end of the foot or diebold came to tickle the defence of dannemarie . 
on the other side , there was a block in the middle of ground and it was just the moving riahi at the forefront of the attack . 
the start of the second half would be decisive with first two occasions signed riahi temporal and for dannemarie , and immediately after the opening of the score for the illhousiens by marshes , well positioned to resume a ball postponed on a first attempt to diebold ( 53rd " ) . 
but the striker illhousiens will not be able to savour his happiness long and will be forced to return to the changing rooms a dozen minutes later and leaving his teammates in digital inferiority . 
but dannemarie will not know benefit and will not pose major problems to a eleven illhousien which has just gone a bit for " compacting " his defence , except in the last seconds of game where , after a big way , the ball going on very close to the board .

they have not been according to the opposition . 
" we have been excluded electoral committees and our observers have not been able to participate in the count , " lamented yuri potemkin , the spokesman for the union of democratic forces , a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties . 
" this is a cosmetic change , highlights alexander milinkevich , former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential and leader of the pro-european movement , because the important thing is that counts the votes , and at home , it is the executive . 
if members of the opposition enter the parliament , is that they have been appointed , not elected . 
but their entry to parliament can mean of space to television , meetings in the regions and the draft laws . " 
the opposition is therefore needs to enter the political game because " it must begin a dialogue with the european union . 
because if our economy , which is heavily in debt to russia , between in crisis , and that we do not reform , we risk becoming a protectorate of russia . 
but we want to be independent . " 
the opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in europe that followed the election process does not recognize the validity of the election . 
it points out that the participation figures seem too high , and that the spread of the vote in anticipation ( 26 % of the electorate in minsk ) has opened the voice to all the manipulation . 
" you have noticed that there was an election , you ? wonder the social democrat leader alexander kozulin , one of the two remaining political prisoners released in august of this year . 
there was no one in the offices of vote . 
and there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in parliament , those that best suit in power . " 
the silence of night falls on the place in october . 
has the television , president lukashenko and members of the central electoral commission welcome their success . 
the interview - blood become course 
h√©ma-qu√©bec yesterday celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation , and its president , the dre francine d√©cary , had reason to celebrate , because h√©ma-qu√©bec has become one of the suppliers of blood the more security and efficient in the world . 
and above all , he has regained the confidence of the public who had been seriously dented by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s . 
as you know , the reserves managed by the national blood transfusion service of the canadian red cross have been infected by the acquired immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) and hepatitis c virus during the 1980s . 
before this tragedy and the grumbles of the public , the government of canada has established in february 1994 a public inquiry , chaired by judge krever giant , which was intended to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations for such a calamity never happens again . 
while the judge krever belatedly to submit his report , some provinces were then set up a committee to plan a new management system of the blood in canada . 
in quebec , the committee g√©lineau has fulfilled this mandate . 
following the reports g√©lineau and krever , two suppliers have been created in canada : h√©ma-qu√©bec to serve the quebec and the canadian company of blood to supply all the other provinces and the two territories . 
" in 1998 , when h√©ma-qu√©bec began its activities , only 38 % of people still had confidence in the system of blood in quebec , recalls the dre d√©cary . 
the situation was discouraging . 
to force of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground during the years that followed , we have regained the confidence of the public , " she said before proudly say that at the beginning of 2008 , nearly 94 % of the population qu√©b√©coise was now confidence in h√©ma-qu√©bec . 
the dre d√©cary warned however that " confidence is something extremely fragile . " 
from its inception , the 28 september 1998 h√©ma-qu√©bec has applied the precautionary principle . 
at that time , it was in europe to the emergence of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease , a new variant cjd , tells the one which takes the strong since its foundation in 1998 . 
" and we do not know whether the disease could be transmitted by blood . 
we then relied on one of the main recommendations of the reports krever and g√©lineau , that when we do not know , and that a serious disease can be arranged , creutzfeldt-jakob disease , which is characterised by a degeneration of the brain , leading inevitably to the death , we undertake measures of exclusion . 
in april 1999 , we therefore refused the blood of people who had stayed more than a month in the uk since 1980 . 
however , a few years ago , it has been proven beyond all doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood . 
this episode we thus showed that the precautionary principle that has been applied made sense . " 
in 1999 , appeared on the market a technique is much more sensitive hiv testing : the tests of nucleic acid ( tan ) that detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself , and not that of antibodies against the virus , which rested the tests used until then . 
the tan have helped to shorten the period silent , which stretches between the moment where the person has been infected and the one where the first virus can be detected in the blood by our technical , explains the specialist . 
we were able to reduce this period to a period of less than a week . 
it has also decreased substantially the risk that some donors are infected without knowing it , and that we can detect . 
these improvements have enabled us to significantly reduce the risk of contracting aids from a blood transfusion . 
today , one in 12 million runs the risk of receiving blood contaminated with hiv . 
" in other words , this means that it will distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected with hiv . 
as h√©ma-qu√©bec distributes each year between 400 and 500 000 000 blood products , it will take more than 24 years before a case of hiv transmission by a blood products . 
i think that we can now feel comfortable to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover the health , " says the head of the direction of h√©ma-qu√©bec . 
" our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products . 
you never know what pathogen will emerge in the system . 
no later than last year came on the island of the meeting the chikungunya virus , which , like the west nile virus , is transmitted by an insect in the blood . 
it must be constantly vigilant , " continues the dre d√©cary before highlighting that in addition to a supply security , h√©ma-qu√©bec must also provide an adequate supply . 
" the needs are increasing as the population ages . 
the treatments currently being more aggressive , patients often need a recharge in red blood cells or up blister packs . 
the ageing of the population also has implications for the network of blood donors who brings together on average than 3 % of quebecois of eligible to donate blood . " 
anyone in health , aged 18 years and over that meet the eligibility criteria can , however , give blood every 56 days , or six times a year . 
on average , 14 % of people who make their blood are not accepted , because they are suffering from aids or malaria , for example , and if they were travelling in a country where there is malaria , they will be excluded for a period of one year . 
" with these 3 % , we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals . 
the shortages are very rare . 
but we must renew the members of this network of donors as they get older and can no longer give blood . 
however , it is difficult to convince people to give blood , but above all to retain and encourage them to become regular donor . 
the life of today , if race is rarely the time to spend an hour to give its blood , " laments francine d√©cary . 
with an annual budget of $ 297 million , h√©ma-qu√©bec not only provides blood products , but also of human tissue , including bone greffons , heart valves , eye globes and skin that is almost exclusively used for the major burns . 
these tissues are analysed , processed and frozen before being stored in h√©ma-qu√©bec which manages the only public bank of cord blood in quebec . 
the umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is full of a rich in blood stem cells which can be used to treat serious diseases , such as leukaemia . 
" we celebrated , a few weeks ago , the bank of our thousandth sample of cord blood , and there are plans to take more than a thousand per year . 
we should begin to propose for transplants at the beginning of next year , " says the dre d√©cary which describes this programme to levy cord blood as very popular . 
" several moms are disappointed not to be able to have access to it , " because h√©ma-qu√©bec does not have the resources to propose this programme complex and costly in all hospitals in quebec . 
soccer - the impact in the semi-finals

charest placing on the north 
the prime minister does not exclude triggering elections before the end of the year 
as soon as the general council of the liberal party finished , jean charest visited yesterday in jean-talon , quebec , where the new minister of health , yves bolduc ( left ) , is trying to get elected on the occasion of the by-election today . 
" push the boundaries of our last great northern border " : that is the long-term ambition that jean charest presented with visual force while remaining within the guidelines , at the end of the general council of the liberal party of quebec , to l√©vis yesterday . 
behind him , during his speech , was projected a kind of mill to images . 
go in loop , on three huge screens , clich√©s spectacular hydroelectric dams , mining , of quebec seen by " google maps , " maps , etc . 
of the major ways as election period . 
in point of press , moreover , the prime minister has refused to rule out that it would trigger the elections this autumn , although it pointed out that his schedule was very busy . 
the " plan " is the fourth part of a " vision " that prime minister claims to have for quebec , that of a " new economic area , " which includes an agreement on the workforce with france , an agreement between canada and europe and agreements with the ontario . 
often mentioned in the speech by the prime minister recently , opening up the north - the northern territory in the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation . 
the prime minister is however blinkered to explain why the north was " a jewel in the huge potential , " but has not given due date , amounts of investment , or precise priority in projects to come . 
at most a few avenues of what could be developed more : notably hydroelectricity , the forest , but above all the mining sector , boosted by growth in emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure . 
the north contains " nickel , zinc , copper , platinum , gold , silver , iron , titanium , and even diamond " , according to the list of mr charest . 
this " territory twice as big as france , " " it is at home , it is in quebec . 
not only is it home , but it is with us , " he insisted , as if to demonstrate that it was asking a national founding myth . 
quebec has much built in its relationship with the north , he has stressed : the gold rush in abitibi , engineering qu√©b√©coise , the bay james . 
" it is up to us , it is our future , " he added , having made a theatrical pause to contemplate the huge map behind him . 
the north , 70 % of quebecois of territory , includes a portion of the labrador that quebec has always claimed , said the prime minister at the point of press . 
" it is a traditional position that all governments have repeated . 
there is a line of border on which there is no agreement for a very long time , and when the opportunity arises , i reiterate that position on behalf of the government , " he said . 
the rest , " with climate change , we need to rethink our vision of the north , " he said in talking about the northwest passage , which will be open throughout the year due to the melting of the ice . 
in this new geopolitical context , the prime minister believes that occupy the territory is a duty . 
and the inhabitants of the territory , the first nations and inuit ? 
the prime minister has said that the government of quebec would be very attentive to their respect and that the project would benefit them , particularly to young people . 
two former ministers from two different parties , pierre corbeil and michel l√©tourneau ( former member p√©quiste of ungava ) , have already begun consultations with a 30 communities . 
a committee chaired by mr inter-ministerial benedict and in which julie millstone ( transport and natural resources ) has an important place has started work . 
the prime minister does not exclude a great meeting , " not necessarily a summit , " but a time when " there will be a common vision . " 
the development of the north would be in conformity with the principles of sustainable development . 
the plan will be " concerted north , orderly and respectful of the environment , " he promised . 
jean charest described this " vision " as continuity with the prime minister liberals that preceded it . 
" as the liberals who preceded us , we thought otherwise to transform the challenges in new opportunities for growth and development . " 
this has been one of the recurring themes of the end of the week , which was launched on friday by a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of the arrival of jean lesage at the head of the party . 
one of the resolutions adopted is proposing to rename the plant beauharnois in ad√©lard-godbout dam . 
" godbout , which has created hydro-qu√©bec , lesage who has done the quiet revolution and the nationalisation of hydroelectricity , bourassa who has done the bay james , our party has been able to build the future , " said jean charest . 
in point of press , he invoked another reference , conservative this , the programme " roads to the north " of john diefenbaker , prime minister from 1957 to 1963 . 
in addressing the hydroelectric dam project of eastmain1a-ruper , mr charest stressed that its service was scheduled for 2012 . 
" it remains us here , but i plan to be there , " he confided to his activists , bringing home the loud applause . 
indeed , the prime minister , who said in april that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009 , has not ruled out the possibility of trigger an election this autumn , what the law allows him . 
it stresses that his schedule , however , is fulfilled , particularly by a mission of the council of the federation in china and a summit qu√©bec-new york . 
the general council of the end of week has provided the liberal leader a platform containing nationalist resolutions , including the " constitutional aspirations , " which are spent as a letter in the post : the plq calls for particularly the recognition " specificity of quebec " in the constitution . 
it would also like the quebec appoints members of the council of broadcasting and telecommunications canadian and that they have a veto on the decisions taken in quebec . 
the side of the opposition , it has welcomed the broad outlines of the plan north with scepticism . 
the chief p√©quiste , pauline marois , has emerged from the policy of development of nord-du-qu√©bec that the government landry was launched in 2001 . 
according to them , the liberal government , arriving to power in 2003 , has decided not to apply it . 
if they had done , " we would be more advanced today , " commented on mrs marois alongside its candidate in jean-talon ( ballot that is taking place today ) , fran√ßoise mercury . 
the adq said support the adoption of a plan north by the government . 
" but what we want is that it is not just a show , " commented the leader s√©bastien proulx , replacing mario dumont , who has just returned from holiday today . 
letters - a country dishonoured 
it is mr vic toews , former " justice " ( o irony ) in the cabinet harper , which hits last summer to say of louise arbour that she was a " shame " for canada . 
lay and shame on this woman who has been a constant struggle for justice and deserves our admiration in also said long on the entourage of prime minister on stephen harper itself . 
here we are in front of a government that is the only , among all western countries involved , not to have repatriated its national locked in the concentration camp of guant√°namo . 
a government that takes no account of the fact that omar khadr was a young teenager at the time of the facts of which it is accused . 
the only government that , despite the fact that canada has signed the geneva convention , denies its floor and leaves rotting in inhumane conditions a child soldier . 
the only one that relies on a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused . 
remember , remember that unicef , amnesty international and the canadian bar association , in particular , are calling for the repatriation of omar khadr in order that he has a fair trial in canada . 
it is the same government that condone torture : it is important that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed , no doubt to ever after so many years of abuse . 
it does not yet , but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights , our freedom and our " democracy , " the word that harper continues to wield and which sounds if hollow in its mouth . 
now is the time where no moral no longer exists : we can bully , torture , arbitrarily imprison a canadian citizen at the whim of a head of government until minority here ( in it will be so after the 14 october ... ) . 
many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates virtue , law and order : they do not see that this government has abandoned what was the reputation and dignity of our country . 
shame , mr toews , it is , in this renunciation , and not elsewhere . 
free opinion - the orwellian speech of barrick gold 
in its edition of 17 september , the duty has published a letter from mr patrick j. garver , deputy director of the canadian mining barrick gold . 
pursuing an orwellian logic , it says that the biggest aurif√®re company in the world has filed a defamation suit of six million against three authors and a small publishing house penniless in order to launch a " public debate transparent " . 
if it is true that the judges are independent and impartial , this is not the truth that they deem to be , especially in the case of libel cases , but the law . 
not surprisingly , this fundamental difference is completely obscured by mr garver . 
because , for barrick gold , the best way to conduct a public debate be lead to ruin anyone who dares to support a contrary position to hers ? 
whatever the outcome of the trial , the authors and the publisher of the black book canada will have to spend huge sums of money in order to prepare their defence and fight , arms very patchy , against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets almost without substance of the mining . 
the tactics , in these struggles unequal , is often of ruining the defendants to impose an amicable settlement which b√¢illonnera the opposition in more frighten anyone who dares to look again at the question . 
if barrick gold really wanted to a public debate , it is before the public that it would have had to present his vision of the facts . 
contrary to what is done in several countries where works barrick gold , the debates in canada are normally made by the exchange of ideas and not with clubs . 
it was enough to the mining to open its books , its records and to establish a real debate , through the newspapers , the media , publications and funding of independent research teams that could shed light on the issue . 
but barrick gold seems not to trust the public and rejected out of hand the petitions and letters of support to the authors of black canada . 
perhaps mr garver he could explain how it can ask a debate " public " all ignores the opinions of the same public ? 
in the world of vice-president , it seems that this word means only the lawyers highly paid and not all of the canadians ; this is a rather narrow view of the concept . 
in a democracy , even critics have the right to speak . 
what does not understand - or does not understand - barrick gold , is that the public which supports the authors and publishers of black canada the fact above all because it rejects the brutal manner of the mining . 
this audience is prepared to hear barrick and to judge , but on the basis of civilised exchanges of arguments , and not in the context of what many perceive as poursuite-b√¢illon ( pursuing the " public debate , " barrick gold has also submit a formal notice to the place of the authors of black canada calling on them to stop the use of this term ... ) . 
beyond the speech surr√©el mr garver , the continuation of barrick gold is a direct attack against freedom of academic research and the pursuit of truth , essential to any democratic society . 
she denies , in block , the right to quote from credible sources and the debate on the facts and interpretations , which represent the very basis of intellectual work . 
if it is impossible to study and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world in a country like canada , under penalty prosecution at rehearsal , which will be able to do this ? 
if barrick gold really wanted to a public debate and transparent , it could do so in accordance with the scientific standards used by the authors of black canada . 
it has a right to replica . 
academia , to which we belong , has long been known to manage the debates and the disagreements and resolve conflicts . 
the excessive pursuit of barrick gold clearly shows that , contrary to what it claims , it has no appetite for a transparent debate . 
this is a loss for the academic world , as well as for the public debate in canada , and it is time that governments put in place arrangements limiting this kind of abusive prosecutions . 
rescue operation of wall street - democrats and republicans are 
the bush administration and the leaders of congress , both republicans and democrats , have finally come to an agreement yesterday on the greatest economic bailout since the great depression of the 1930s . 
the new version of the plan of 700 billion us dollars to curb the financial crisis that has rocked wall street for months must still be approved by both houses of congress . 
it provides in particular : better control by the elected representatives of its implementation , new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed , new provisions to contain the number of homes seized for default , as well as a right of scrutiny on the salaries paid to executives of companies rescued . 
the us treasury secretary , henry paulson , president of the house of representatives , nancy pelosi , and the republican representative at the negotiating table , senator judd gregg , have announced the good news for a few minutes after midnight , yesterday , at the end of a marathon negotiations in two days . 
" we have made great progress towards a deal that will be effective on the markets , " said the representative of the bush administration , henry paulson . 
" everything has been done to put out the real economy and ordinary americans of the ongoing crisis on wall street , " explained the democrat . 
" this is the fundamental point : if we do not do this , the trauma , the chaos and disruption on the daily lives of americans will be immense , " said the republican judd gregg . 
the talks had turned to sprint in the final hours by fear of the effect that would cause another failure on the mood of investors . 
the time limit we paid was the opening up of markets this morning . 
associates late in the negotiations , the two candidates in the american presidential election were in favour of understanding , without fail , however , to express their discontent that you need to get to this stage . 
the democratic senator barack obama is awarded the addition of some provisions in the agreement , such as the one aimed at allowing owners to keep their homes and that on the salary of the leaders of companies survivors by the state . 
" when you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some , there is nothing to be pleased . 
but these measures are necessary , " he commented on the waves of american television . 
asked about another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan , his republican opponent , john mccain , said : " i would like to see the details , but i hope that yes . " 
" the broad lines that i have read [ show ] that it is something that we will all have to digest and with which we are going to be able to move forward . 
the option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable , " he said . 
the 700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayer money the bad debt , risky assets and unsaleable of us financial institutions . 
it comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the collapse of a housing bubble that was first led to the collapse of the mortgage ( subprime ) before spreading to other forms more widespread credit securities ( pcaa ) and lead to a freeze of liquidity and on the exodus of banks and financial institutions . 
this is a group of elected republicans that wrecked the first draft of understanding , last week . 
it believes to be out of this impasse since the democrats have agreed that some " toxic " assets of struggling airlines are only insured by the government , rather than purchased . 
in order to cut corners to everyone in congress , it has also added a provision that if the government were to take such losses for five years with this programme , it could put in place new taxes to help it to recover its implementation . 
the new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion which will add another 100 billion if the president deems it necessary . 
the payment of 350 billion should be ratified by a vote of congress . 
in exchange for his help , washington will get holdings in companies rescued it be worth of dividends in the event of profit and that it will sell when the turmoil will be passed . 
the federal government will have the opportunity to delay the procedures of foreclosures on homes attached to the mortgages affected by this plan , as well as to set limits on the pay and allowances of departure paid to leaders of the companies affected . 
the architects of the plan would see it put to the vote in the house of representatives today , and the senate on wednesday . 
despite all their efforts , it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light . 
of the votes have continued to rise yesterday against this project , both in the republican camp that democrat . 
" obviously , washington does not hear you , " said to his constituents the republican scott garrett , a member of the finance committee of the house . 
" yes , we have a serious financial problem . 
yes , there are solutions . 
but not one which is to take advantage of taxpayers . " 
host a small group in congress dubbed " the caucus of sceptical , " democratic representative brad sherman presents differently , but it comes to the same conclusion . 
" four hundred distinguished economics professors , including three nobel laureates , we have written to tell us : we request to congress not to hurry and carefully consider the road to take , " he said yesterday . 
at the same time , in europe , it was once again the global nature of the crisis . 
at the end of an emergency meeting , the three benelux countries have announced the partial nationalisation of the banking group fortis for 11,2 billion euros ( 16,3 billion us ) . 
the intervention of the governments of belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg had been made necessary after the french bank bnp paribas has indicated that it departed to acquire its competitor in trouble since she has lost 2 billion euros ( 2,9 billion us ) in the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the united states . 
fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the 20 major european banks and of the ten biggest insurers . 
" this is not money lost , said yesterday the dutch finance minister , wouter bos . 
in exchange , they get a right to vote in the bank and influence . 
it is just something that savers and households appreciate now that the time looks uncertain . " 
meanwhile , on the other side of the channel , the british government seemed on track to nationalise another bank bullied by the financial crisis . 
according to the english press , the government would take over the whole loans underway among the bank bradford and bringley , of which more than 41 billion ( 75,5 billion us ) of mortgages . 
the spanish bank santander announced yesterday that it is she who would buy the branches and the accounts customers of the british bank . 
the bradford and bringley would be the second bank , after the northern rock , the british government should nationalize since the start of this financial crisis .

citizen model , in sum , and in addition . 
that could well make zuschlag & company in their factory in bills ? 
soon , on 8 october , will start the hearings relating to the ongoing criminal procedure , against j√°nos zuschlag and his accomplices . 
the politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud , in the form of criminal organisation , permanently and regularly , having coached the damage , especially important . other charges were retained against them , as for example , false and use of false . 
according to prosecutors , the money from subsidies , was spent for personal gain , while the benefits were justified by false invoices . 
state money and municipalities , approximately 65 million huf in total , was of a hand in the coffers of the movement fiatal baloldal and on the other hand , in the pocket of some people . 
their method , made public by the authorities in charge of the investigation , was to touch the money grants obtained by issuing bills of expenses , behind which no real provision was provided and thus , the associations are never met their commitments . 
according to the indictment , a large part of the invoices were false . 
for these , they diaries ‚Äí bills the market j√≥zsefv√°ros , while they were making stamps to kiskunhalas . 
for the names of companies that would be on the bills , it was decided , among others , during the touring province of north of lake balaton , carried out by istv√°n lados , j√°nos zuschlag on request . 
according to the testimony of the latter , he had to spot of pensions and restaurants . 
for his personal consumption , he called for a bill , on the model of which they realized the other bills that they would introduce , among others , from the ministry of youth and sport , the ministry of social affairs and labour , as well as the city of the capital for access to the subsidies . 
the majority of invoices was created by istv√°n lados and his accomplice , andr√°s ≈ëri , which according to our information , was especially to draft the files needed to obtain subsidies . 
at a " tracking circuit , " one of the choices of lados was a bistro . 
according to the two bills issued by the zuschlag in 2003 , this place has assured the restoration of a group of 90 people , members of the association biztos egyes√ºlet bridge . 
however , according to the manager , it would have been impossible that so many people have this place , at the same time . 
in the same way , in the summer of 2002 , the bill on behalf of the foundation jobb j√∂v≈ë√©rt , which later will bear the name of egy√ºtt has harmadik √©vezred√©rt , grouillait failings of forms and content . 
a pension , located in badacsonytomaj , did in fact that three rooms , and maximum ten people could spend the night . however , the bill was one hundred and thirty clients . 
issuers of bills on the vivid imagination have also fallen in excess , when they mentioned the society pigal kft , belonging to and catering sector . in their accounts , or the name of jobb j√∂v≈ë√©rt nor the hopp√° does not appear , according to the information to the public prosecutor 's office . 
gy≈ëz≈ë farkas , the manager of the company , said the site hvg.hu that when the public prosecutor 's office has summoned and showed him the bills , it has been able to immediately , that it was false documents . 
" the name of our society and our number of tax were placed in a bad place on the pill . " 
he added : " beyond the form , the fact that according to the bill , a hundred people have housed there , do not christian democratic parties either , since this establishment has only eleven rooms , which have not so much space . 
in addition , the bill also mentions meal , and the restaurant is closed for a long time . " 
issuers of zealous bills are not informed on the travel agencies of budapest , part of their choice , but only organising trips abroad . thus , naively , they have indicated stays in hungary on bills to settle in cash , which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency . 
also , as it transpired during the investigation , they also ccee contribution vat on these documents , while the benefits on the activities of trips , including the destination is outside the european union , are paid for without vat . 
similarly , the vat rate of the four bills established in the name of the hotel r√©vf√ºl√∂p to order jobb j√∂v≈ë√©rt was incorrect , because the benefits of society do not bear a vat of 25 % , as pointed out , but a vat to 15 % . in addition , the employees of the hotel only emit printed bills , while the false were drafted in hand . 
the investigation of the public prosecutor reveals that the " issuers have also made mistakes by mentioning as provision road freight transport , that the issuing company bills could not exercise , given that its profile was the council in investment . 
moreover , it is also for the vices of forms , as the types of bills inadequate and false seals , that the bills issued the order of egy√ºtt has harmadik √©vezred√©rt alap√≠tv√°ny , xxi . sz√°zadi kultur√°lis egyes√ºlet and biztos bridge have proved false . 
just as in the case of society ravenna bt. or sporting internship kunfeh√©rt√≥ , who both deny perpetrators of invoices issued on their behalf . 
the counterfeiters have not paid attention to the fact that society hib kft . , established in ny√≠regyh√°za , was in liquidation at a time when ( in 2001 ) the group of fiatal v√°ros√©rt egyes√ºlet was supposed to take a meal at home . according to our information , it is for this reason that the receivership of society denies having cast this bill . 
bills set deliberately 
another category of issuers of bills is composed of those who were fully aware that they were asked to give the fictitious bills . 
the foundation es√©ly budapest√©rt alap√≠tv√°ny , at the request of the grouping of fiatal baloldal - ifj√∫ szocialist√°k , has established a bill to the order of the foundation egy√ºtt has harmadik √©vezred√©rt , for a sum of four million huf . 
according to the indictment , the manager of society collab kft. was brought to issue false invoices by one of the accused , ludovic gy√∂rfi . 
similarly , has cooperated with the zuschlags , society biogate kft . , who is currently in liquidation and that in 2003 , issued bills on the order of the foundation jobb j√∂v≈ë√©rt alap√≠tv√°ny , of the association atlasz egyes√ºlet and the association v√∂r√∂sfeny≈ë egyes√ºlet , for a total of about five million huf , but behind which no provision has actually been provided . 
no financial movement has taken place , not more , given that the invoices were cancelled by the result , but this , the organisations have avoided mention it in their accounts . 
the next category of issuing companies bills is that of the firms directly linked to the accused . 
thus , the administrative delegate the director general of the delta society tri√≥ kft . , doing the trade of fuel and cars , whose headquarters was in budapest , but where there was nowhere to be found , was iv√°n kubatov . 
in october , november and december 2005 , this company has issued several bills on the sale of computer equipment , for a total of about 18 million huf . 
according to the investigation , such equipment would have been purchased by the company cash investment kft. of kiskunhalas , who was in liquidation since 14 september 2005 . 
the director of this society was a man of romanian origin , who iv√°n kubatov would also have sent documents in connection with the society , between 2002 and 2005 . 
according to what we know , kubatov acknowledged during the inquiry that it issued bills on the order of societies atlasz , hopp√° and egy√ºtt has harmadik √©vezred√©rt alap√≠tv√°ny , and he has pocketed their equivalent . 
it is precisely at the request of iv√°n kubatov that bricklayers romanians have created the companies fa-bani jos faipari kft. jos-investment and bt . 
in fact , none of these companies worked , what the accused explained by the fact that they did not receive work . 
it is served when these societies , because at the request of master zsolt szente coaccus√© , as well as editor of the acts of corporate foundation , established the bills to their names , the order of associations relating to zuschlag , as the associations atlasz and y-gener√°ci√≥ . 
kubatov gave organisms , 15 bills in total , issued by the companies cash investment , delta tri√≥ , fa-bani jos , jos investment and linaxtrade , for a value of 14,2 million huf . 
the prosecutors believed that 10 % of are indicated on the bills as well as the vat in the pocket of kubatov . 
the man has even used the society szi-beri bt. to establish fictitious bills that have been used in the context of the grant request of biztos bridge . 
in january 2006 , the association y-gener√°ci√≥ and sz√∂vets√©g has modern magyarorsz√°g√©rt has submitted a request to grant from the body of public utility of the socialist party , t√°ncsics mih√°ly alap√≠tv√°ny ( mri ) . 
they have achieved this subsidy for an amount twice 500.000 huf , but these amounts have not been used for the objectives set out in the request . 
to avoid that it does not know , five fictitious bills received the society works team kft. have been presented to the mri . 
moreover , it is these bills that have been found during the raid in the office of √°rp√°d kemecsei , the ministry of education . 
during the hearing , a part of the accused relatera the manufacturing method of invoices , as it had already done before the public prosecutor 's office previously . 
what could be really interesting is that the accused main , j√°nos zuschlag itself , decides to lift the veil on the whole story . 
until now , its admissions are not very detailed , and although he has promised on several occasions to tell the details , it has not yet done so . 
the question is whether it is in its interest , or , possibly , the socialists would have reached an agreement that in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the 50 million huf , zusi would only the hat . 
today , it is probably offended , since the requests for his placement under house arrest , on the basis of a reduction of its conditions of detention , continually fall on deaf ears . 
while those who have caused damage much more important , and the authors of economic crimes not repairable , roam freely or at least , expecting to their own home , the end of the procedure . he did not this possibility . 
the psychology of the surfeit : why we 're spending more money ? 
at auctions , buyers tend to spend more , and overestimate the commodity . 
researchers in neurology and in economics from the university of new york have managed to update the neurological and economic foundations of this behaviour known and apparently irrational . 
according to their study published in the journal science , the human beings do not want to be dependent on this type of competition , such as an auction on ebay , and that is why they prefer even pay too high a price . 
this research have tried to draw up a neurological pattern of this sort of " game " with the help of experimental auctions . 
one of the groups of volunteers playing the lottery , while the other group took part in an auction playful , while with the aid of a process of functional magnetic resonance ( fmri ) , the researchers studied the areas of the brain assets of the experimental subjects . 
in the two games , the participants could earn money , but during the auction an essential part of which is the surfeit of a third , all under the brain stem , called striatum was the movement of intensive way at the loss of the game . 
this part of the brain , in addition to several other functions , plays a role in the mechanism " auto-stimulation " of the nervous system . 
that is why , according to the researchers , the rise in prices is with the flight before the violent reaction of striatum . 
has the support of their theories , the members economists of this group of researchers have pursued analyses of financial supervision . 
in them , three groups surench√©rissaient with a partner , in various circumstances . 
they were simply informed the group monitoring the real value of the product in question , and they have done their implementation . 
has another group , they have promised that , if they came out a winner of the part , so they would receive $ 15 additional , reward . 
while the third group has received these 15 dollars before the auction , but the members of the group also lost money , in case they lost the bidding . 
the difference between these two groups is , in fact , that the emphasis was put in one on the victory , while in the other , on the failure . 
in demonstrating the assumption of neuroscientists , members of the team of players " against the failure " were willing to put higher than those made by the control group and the group " for the victory . 
" these results cannot be proven by any existing economic theory . 
indeed , each of them explained the phenomena noted at auctions by the pleasure of winning and the parade before the risk . 
only the neurological imaging methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories in leading , now , on a third explanation . " - has seen andrew schotter , professor of the faculty of economics from the university of new york . 
hepatitis : when should consult a doctor ? 
in the world , about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis b or c , while in hungary , the chronic disease of the liver is mentioned among the first causes of death . 
an estimated 100 miles the sick carriers of the virus hepatitis in hungary , but only seven miles follow treatment . this is the fact that often patients do not know they are carriers of the virus . 
the name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses . 
there are many similarities between their symptoms . the inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristics , but the pathogens and diseases caused differ from each other . 
hepatitis viruses , according to the genes , pathogens spread mainly in two forms : the hepatitis a and e through the digestive tract ( for example : food or contaminated water ) , hepatitis b , c , d and other viruses by the blood and organic liquid ( sperm , vaginal secretion , spit ) . 
for passengers , in any case it is advisable to get vaccinated against the virus has and b. there is no vaccine against the c. 
the symptoms of hepatitis has appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated food , in general , accompanied by a poor state general , of weakness , upset stomach and nausea . 
then grows on the skin and on the white of the eye a jaundice visible , the seats are becoming more clear and the urine takes a color more dark . the cure can take two to three weeks . 
across the world , every year , a million people die of the most serious form of the disease , such as cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis b. 
the main cause is that according to estimates , only a sick on ten receives medical treatment . 
hepatitis c can also have serious consequences : if it is not treated , it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer . 
most of the sick is not widely known reached the virus , because the gene pathogen destroyed underhand way liver cells . in many cases , the first symptoms only appear after 20 to 30 years . 
consequently , an early prevention is very important , as well as regular screening tests . 
the contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups : the people who have suffered a blood transfusion before 1991 , consumers of drugs and the tatou√©s . 
currently , we figure to 200 million people with a type of chronic hepatitis c in the world . 
since the disease can be detected by a routine examination in the laboratory , it is advised to consult their doctor dealing from the observation of symptoms of unknown origin . 
the disease can be cured , if it is detected in time . the virus can be eradicated from the body , in this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of a cancer is warned . 
the 30 september is the world day of hepatitis , organised for the first time in 2004 by the bodies representative of patients from around the world . 
its aim is to draw attention to the chronic cirrhosis of the liver , caused by the virus , on the causes of its development and on the importance of early diagnosis of the disease . 
the one that is growing in god concerned less pain ? 
according to the results of a recent research , the religious belief would work as a kind of analgesic , which would have already helped to make it more bearable death martyrs catholics . 
the british newspaper telegraph published an article that researchers at oxford university have done an interesting experiment analysing at what level the belief in god could influence the tolerance to the pain of the human being . 
in the context of this experience for the bizarre 12 catholic believers and atheists have been subjected to electric shock therapy during that each of them was a painting of the virgin mary . 
according to the results , believers catholics have been able to exclude much of the suffering . 
thanks to a technique of patted down of the human brain , it has been also discover that catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of the pain . 
this analysis is the first of a series of experiments , which academics , scientists , philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university . 
more precisely , the experience is held as follows : an instrument issuing sparks and broadcasting the ect is set on the left hand of the experimental subject . 
the researchers asked the participants of the experience of watching sustained two paintings , one being the virgin mary sassoferrato painted by the 17th century and the other , the lady in the hermine painted by leonardo da vinci in the 15th century . 
researchers at the origin of this experience had hoped that the sight of the virgin mary refers to a kind of state of faith among the believers , while the choice of the painting of da vinci , not very different from the first , was on its calming effect . 
experimental subjects spent half an hour in an mri scanner , and during this time , have received 20 ect in four part succession , watching is the painting to subject religious theme is more general . 
catholics have said that in view of the virgin mary , they felt as " safe , " as someone that you " takes care " and they are " quiet , and peace has invaded . " 
has the view of the painting of religious thematic , they account for 12 % of pain in less than when they looked at the effect of leonardo . 
the psychologist miguel farias , who himself took part in the experiment , believe that we can achieve the same effects with any other powerful image , with atheists , provided to find the photo appropriate . 
" we should find a picture which they respond very positively , such as a mother or father , " said psychologist . 
tom wright , anglican bishop , welcomed the results of this research . 
" the practice of the faith should change and in a lot of cases , actually changes our personality , " added wright . 
after these excellent results , it is not that the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if it shows the believers madonna-like a painted by leonard or by a painter of the same arms ? 
does the sight of a virgin mary of better quality would lead to better results ? 
you are what you divulgues to your subject 
has the opportunity to its tenth anniversary , google says that we can find it at the bottom of the pockets of the people in the same way that the sky over their head . he knows where they spent their vacations , they should consult specialists and what are their centres of interest . 
yet it is not yet enough , according to eric schmidt , who is one of the influential people of society . 
while in regard to the sceptics establishing a parallel with the vision of horror of orwell , they do not see the bulk of the web 2.0 . 
eric schmidt said , there is little , the financial times that the main ambition of google is to gather more information about its users . this is necessary for the founders of google can respect their original purpose that sounded as follows : " set out in a system all the information in the world ! " . 
according to the leader of google asked , after ten years of a work of global its foundations , they are still at the beginning of their objectives to deal with all the information . 
the question : what will be in five years ? schmidt replied that he would like google can answer questions like " what could i do tomorrow ? " or " what is the work that i would be the better ? " . however , the software will not respond to this kind of issue , simple at first sight , that the day they will know enough about users . 
it is not perfectly clear to all internet users that the words used in research on the internet , the ip address of the computer , which sends research and the pages consulted then by those interested are listed . 
through the programme personalized search launched two years ago , users can , for example , store their own history of research and can read what they have sought , what they have cliqu√© . thanks to this , in the long term , recommendations , programme is based on the same logic , will be able to give answers much more personalized , and we will submit products and services on the basis of our previous statements and our preferences registered . 
that happens if someone is using my data against me , if he looks at what is my work ? asking users , who are concerned about seeing the monopoly of information of google . 
in most cases , it is the potential power represented by society , which can cause of fear , and this is not the remorse , the fear of punishment , the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against the power that can arouse a contre-r√©action internet users . 
however , it is a fact confirmed that the terms sought are not only registered , but in justified cases , they are sent to a third , and , in this kind of legal cases , nothing protects the personal rights of internet users . 
the example most resounding these days is probably the coordinated action against paedophiles brazilians , in which google has sent to the brazilian government information that he had collected on the public page called do , allowing a identification . 
internet users mindful of the rights of the person were able to breathe a sigh of relief last may , when google , arm in below with the body of legal protection electronics eff , has proved his good right in court with the fbi . according to the ruling , in the future , google will still not be bound by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information on the request of the fbi , secret of any kind . 
( at the same time , the federal government has successfully obtained a few 50.000 web addresses and 1.000 terms of research he had won by the strengthening of the law on child protection , voted several years ago . but in the end , it fails to acquire the lists of research private users , or the whole list of internet sites and keywords in these last two months . ) 
the judgment of google is therefore quite contradictory : it is castigated by those who fear the transmission of their personal data , because they think their sphere intimate and their private sector suffer when they are starting to use the services of google . therefore , they are attacking them in the spirit of revolt that you express against multinational companies proud of their conservative image . 
meanwhile , the american study nerd culture and its " sauvageons " bringing together the passionate , activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see google the next generation of big business , " the corporation hooked , " by opposition to his rival , microsoft , classified as invader of the world because of windows , and this , even if all the two are fighting for the same purpose . 
this can be explained by the fact that google , unlike microsoft , does not ask its users of identification code , is not asking for money for its applications . the code documentary and the package of programmes , continuously cooled , has a much more accessible , younger and more cool , faced with the practice of official giant of the software . 
the reason may also be that the geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between the rights of the individual and the internet , and what the web 2.0 , the key word most proclaimed the last few years , draws precisely behind him . 
indeed , the web 2.0 is not something other than the collaboration , that the fact that we let intentionally traces behind us , and that we use communication channels available to us , and while the dimension of these changes , one by one , the essence remains the same : one is exposed . 
a young , in general , can take a profile on several public pages , from facebook to xanga , and it can even linking them to other benefits , such as twinter , or last.fm , listant its musical habits . second , it can connect them to a system to prosecution , as friendfeed or blip.fm. these young people can also take blogs , which automatically appear in their most recent galleries of photos that they store on flickr or on picasa . 
while we can take knowledge of many examples , such as the girlfriend which includes easily to the order of the photos in the morning , taken by the circle of friends in common , with which his friend unfaithful spent the evening , or that of the society which has dismissed one of its employees , just for the opinions sincere that it wrote on his blog about the top management , we can be on one thing : the term privacy is completely to reconsider our days . 
those who live a life online , is composed of what it shows by itself , and so it is that one can define the principle behind the behaviour of young people today . 
that wants to hide something , or at least , wants to try to circumvent the monopoly of google , can do it ( starting with , for example , scroogle , using the system of google , but , at the same time , leaving no trace intentionally ) . 
the number of people who , deliberately , do not register pages for public that it is not possible to find them , is not insignificant . the services of google online , via the treatment of text to the treatment of image , the reading of information can be replaced by alternative versions , which are not linked to huge server farms and which do not assemble our best profile , having existed until this day . 
the public expects , without really is in hiding , when google revealed its true nature . 
the company , with its current value of 156 billion dollars , is worth more than ibm ( 140 billion dollars ) , intel ( 124 billion dollars ) or coca-cola ( 110 billion dollars ) . the areas advertisers adwords / adsense threaten the turnover of advertising agencies , while the benefits introduced at a speed of increasingly important cause serious migraine not only to microsoft , but to many other creators of computer programs . 
however , observers are critical , alongside all this , the contradictions with worrying effects : for example , the top management of society has refused , in its entirety , the protests employees , after it has doubled the price of kindergarten of enterprise and after that the company has found it too expensive restoring daily multiple , taken anywhere . all this pales next to the fact that already in 2006 , google has acquiesced to the chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement , the company detects all the results which injure the good taste , as well as the interests of the chinese regime . 
according to one of the internal rules of society , the new services are not announced that when they can be used . what is on , is that in the coming months and years , they will move the world on new points . while some believe that the project to scan and archiving of books and magazines of google takes the dimensions so important that society will soon find themselves facing the supreme court of the united states , other tremble before its system health , because in it , we can build a full medical benefit from our results of previous analyses , our doctors and our problems . 
the fact that google gets a basis of genetic data can give a good raw material to the next generation of science-fiction writers . the novel of the famous doctorow cory , writing with demi-tons orwelliens , described the future in which a man could be approached in a whopping nothing that through the data to google .

the stock market of warsaw made a proposal for the purchase of the prague stock exchange 
the stock market values of warsaw has proposed two hundred million euros , about five billion kronor czechs , for the purchase of 100 % of the package of shares of the stock market values of prague . 
ludwik sobolewski , the president of the stock market values of warsaw , confirmed this proposal that the poles have made despite that , previously , the czechs have ruled out the warsaw stock exchange the circle of potential new owners of the stock market in prague . 
the cause of this exclusion is that the warsaw stock exchange is in the hands of the state . 
99 % of the shares are in the hands of the polish state who wants to secede from more than 60 % of its actions in a few months of activities . 
according to the daily czech economic e15 , the proposal of poles represents the highest offer has been made so far to the purchase of the prague stock exchange . 
according to the czech press , the stock market of vienna , the transatlantic exchange nasdaq , the stock exchange in new york , the london stock exchange and deutsche b√∂rse have made an offer to date . 
petr koblic , the director of the prague stock exchange , said last week that among the interested , the warsaw stock exchange would be the new owner the less good , and has not ruled out the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the stock exchange of prague in the future . 
the value of the stock exchange of prague is estimated between 5 to 10 billion kronor czechs by specialists of the market . 
on the basis of an agreement between the shareholders , some 90 % of papers would be sold . 
the largest owner of the stock exchange of prague is the investment bank patria finance , with about 25 percent of shares , followed by the 14,7 percent of the bank cesk√° sporitelna and the tiger holding oven s. a.r.l. with 13,5 percent . 
the financial crisis from the point of view of the european press 
in their comments tuesday dedicated to the international financial crisis worsening , day by day , the newspapers leaders of the european press already talk a " second 11 september . " 
" the global financial disaster , it is the american president " - accuses the rome daily la repubblica . " the president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill , improvised rushed to help a heartbreaking situation ... " 
instead of a new pearl harbour , as was the billionaire warren buffett , it is more appropriate to talk about a second 11 september . 
part of the madrid press also sees the scapegoat in washington . 
according to the vision of the daily newspaper el mundo , the failings of the political direction there that has brought the world economy on the brink of collapse . 
the danger of the collapse of the us financial system is growing every day , and later , the world will pay the high price . 
bush 's plan was far from perfect , however according to the vote of congress , a real danger threat , the one that washington does not propose to political tool for dealing with the crisis . 
the world economy hangs in the void , just when the history of capitalism , one of the biggest changes took place . 
we cannot ignore the threat longer - highlights the tages-anzeiger in geneva . 
some states can still be a lifeline to their financial bodies titubants , and thanks to their money taxpayers , they can save them from collapse . 
of course , if more banks collapse like dominoes , then neither financial resources , or new improvisations will not be enough . 
in the long term , we need the states of the european union did little of their national egotism , and they aggregate the control over the financial markets divided . 
nothing that monday , the weakened financial bodies have received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the viennese daily newspaper der standard , which adds that fears that european taxpayers also will have to put their hands in their pockets , deep , similar to the americans in order to tackle the crisis , are becoming more and more realistic . 
so far , the eu has not really worked on the crisis , which , like a tsunami , crosses , hand in hand , the old continent . 
" rescuers " must not use immediately 100 billion euros , by against this would be good if they rated in which case it would be reasonable to taking money from the taxpayer , with the objective of preventing greater damage . 
the smart car imitates the flight of the bumblebee 
what method would be best to develop technologies to avoid an obstacle , if not the imitation of a detector of obstacles that already exists in nature ? 
as for example , that of bees . 
in the draft was presented at the surprising ceatec , taking place in japan , bees bourdonnantes have given the strategic idea the engineers at nissan , to inspire them on the way they need to design the next generation of detectors of obstacles . 
in collaboration with the university of tokyo , nissan has built a mini car robot , a system to command auto-robotis√© bio-inspir√© , type br23c , he has equipped qualities of bees , the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all the obstacles . 
during its flights , each bee is its own space , oval form , which in reality , looks very much like our hull of protection secured - has explained , at the expo , kazuhhiro doi , the director of the department research and development and technological public relations of the brand . 
the eye to facets of the bee plays an important role , since it is able to see in all directions , in a corner of 300 degrees . 
to mimic the functions of the eye to facets , engineers have raised the idea of t√©l√©m√®tre to laser . 
it identifies the obstacles in a corner of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters before the br23c , it assesses the distances and sends a signal to the microprocessor board , who transformed into avoidance manoeuvre immediately . 
the perception of the barrier has take place in a fraction of a second . then , the mini auto robot , mimicking the movements of the bee , immediately change the direction of his wheels in the turning point of a light enough to avoid the collision . 
unlike any existing system currently , this avoidance maneuver takes place entirely instinctively . 
" if it was not as well , the mini auto robot could not respond quickly enough to avoid the obstacle " - explains toshiyuki andoh , the director of the laboratory mobility and the project robotic car . 
it must react instinctively instant and , since this technology is the layer the most vulnerable and most of the envelope protection , a layer where for the moment the collision is considered inevitable . 
this whole process must reflect what the bee done to avoid the other bees . 
the process should take place in the blink of an eye . 
has the opposite of bees , the difference can not go up , down or diagonal , it cannot be that two dimensions , and only in the direction in which the wheels may turn . 
in this way , in the place of the endless combinations that possess bees to avoid the other bees , in our case , we have been able to use that the rotary movement , the acceleration and the slowdown as moves at the disposal of the mini auto robot 
the br23c uses lithium batteries polymer which are lighter and whose focused energy is greater , which makes their lifetime longer than in the lithium-ion version . 
according to andoh is the smart instinctive reaction which is vital , not the data processing , and even less the ability to store . 
this mechanism must treat that some signals entrants per second , and respond to them . 
it is not necessary to the store and react with the intuitive logic is based on data from previous manoeuvres . in this way , it uses only a few dozen kilo-octets of memory in continues . 
we do not need memory with a capacity of gigabits , or even m√©ga-octets . 
this is the first step towards the concept of a technology for the instant avoidance . according to the estimates of nissan , this system will its entry in the cars manufactured in series in the next ten years . 
another application could be its incorporation into the gps satellite navigation system , so that it can guide the driver to its destination avoiding obstacles in his path . 
it has even given a name to the baby out of price 
the written version of the economic rescue plan to 700 billion dollars to buy the credits dubious of banks , and to use in several times , is ready . 
in the first round , half of that will be spent . 
reuters announcement that during new debates are extending until after midnight local time on saturday , the east coast , the leaders of congress have agreed on the controversies that exists for days and days , around the rescue plan for a total of 700 billion dollars . 
" we have carried out a serious step forward " - said nancy pelosi , the democratic chairman of the us house of representatives , after which it only remains to put the agreements on paper . 
the compromise , born from the plan , is supported by both candidates for the presidency , barack obama and john mccain . 
the us treasury secretary , henry paulson , said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the programme will work and will be effective , however other measures have yet to be implemented . according to pelosi , there is no question that , here , the bailout of wall street , but to spin the wheels of the economy in the other direction . 
the written version of the plan has been made public before the asian markets open , on sunday evening to 20h , washington local time ( that is , like , on monday morning , according to the local time of central europe ) , but has not caused spectacular rise in the stock market . 
on monday , the house of representatives will be the first to vote on the bill , responding on behalf of emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 . then , its fate will be in the hands of the senate . 
on saturday evening , president george w. bush has spoken to pelosi , then the white house has also welcomed the news of the agreement . 
" we are satisfied with the advanced attacks this night , and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy " - said tony fratto , the spokesman for the white house . 
moreover , the programme differs from the original proposal made by the bush administration , which it stated that the $ 700 billion must be spent only once , for the purchase of securities on the appropriations dubious . 
now , maximum half the sum of $ 700 billion can be spent . the first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by congress , probably monday . this amount will first secretary of the treasury to buy bad debt from banks , while the use of the additional $ 100 billion will be left to the discretion of the president . 
the programme will be overseen by an independent body , in which the president of the federal reserve will take part . 
the spending of the second half of the $ 700 billion depends on a new decree of congress . 
under the law , the secretariat of the treasury will be able to put in place a strategy combined : it can , at the same time , buy bad debt , titles on the mortgages and dodgy mortgages , as well as other types of " toxic " debts . 
the people in charge of the ministry said that bailouts can take place within the framework of an auction , but also directly . 
the rule allows companies concerned , take part in a programme of insurance , where the secretariat of the treasury guarantees the tools to the origin of the concerns , for which the companies have paid a premium equivalent to the damage predictable . 
henry paulson has said that the law provides the tools necessary to spend 700 billion dollars to the urgent needs of the financial system , that it is the vast takeover of dubious claims , their insurance , or to avoid the risk of the system leading to the collapse of one or the other important financial institution . 
" we will take the necessary measures , to be ready for the application of the law , as soon as it is signed " - he added . 
in contrast , the leaders of the banks who are in bad posture and waiting for the support of the state can expect their redundancy payments , called simply golden parachute overseas , will be capped by the government . 
the capping salaries is mentioned only in very specific cases . in addition , the limitations depend on how the secretariat of the treasury proposes its aid to the company . 
the principle of capping means that if the secretariat of the treasury is buying up within the framework of an auction , they pr√©l√®veront a surplus of tax on the golden parachute , unless president of discredited bank based in retirement . 
immediately after the purchase of bad debt , the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders should not be exaggerated . 
so that the image is complete , we still need to add that the existing golden parachutes have not been modified . the ceiling is that the new contracts , this to motivate and participation in the plan . 
this is the first time in the history of the united states that the caps will be legal in force on the allowances of directors-general - has commented on the president of the commission in charge of financial services of the chamber of deputies , the democrat barney frank . 
in addition , the state provides a right of acquisition of shares in the banks taking part in the plan . in this way , the risk of taxpayers decreases , since they can even be a winner in the case as soon as the economy and with it the banks saved will rebound on their legs . 
the bill mentions that in the next five years , the president must introduce to congress , a proposal that will decide on the way in which the losses will be returned to taxpayers , from the financial sector . 
the two sides , there was , of course , those who have expressed their doubts about the plan . 
this is not what the american people we have mandated , this does not protect the dollars of taxpayers - said the republican member of california darrell issa . 
his colleague , democrat of ohio , mary kaptur think they are the same people who are urging the measures , that those responsible for the collapse of wall street .

sunday , barack obama and john mccain , the candidates for the presidency of the two big parties americans , have ensured their support the bailout of the government of $ 700 billion . however , there are politicians who are demanding the resignation of the us treasury secretary . 
after the negotiations marathons that have lasted for days and days , the representatives in congress and the administration have finally announced , on sunday at dawn , they reached agreements in principle on the bailout of the banks . 
this financing plan , aimed the thawing of the crisis on wall street and the credit market paralyzed , has become the central issue in the presidential campaign . 
obama and mccain are the same , each as more capable than the other , to lead the country out of the economic crisis . 
according to the most recent polls , with before economic issues , obama has once again managed to get a little advance . the advance of mccain , achieved with the nomination of sarah palin as colisti√®re just after the republican convention , has melted . 
at a campaign rally in detroit , sunday , obama has expressed hope that the congress vote quickly the law on the rescue plan of 700 billion .

the press review of the german language territory 
the camp of the right is intact , it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is the way that refers to the der spiegel , the low score of the csu in the bavarian country . 
haider is ready to govern austria , to prevent the coalition of the red and black . 
der spiegel ( spiegel.de ) 
in the internet edition of the magazine of information left german , franz walter analysis the causes of the dramatic defeat of the csu in his article entitled " the revolution in bavaria devours its fathers . " 
according to this political scientist acknowledged , the erosion of the csu started before the sad beckstein-huber duo takes its functions . 
the socialists christians have transformed the bavaria for decades and now , these same modern citizens that they are turning their backs . 
this change in time is , at the same time , the problem of any christian democracy , and also that of angela merker . 
for the csu , the failure was not entirely a surprise , but on sunday , happened to end a process that was likely there is this , just ten years ago , the national party 's undisputed hegemony ended . 
there are 10 years ago , in 1998 , the csu is ramassait with 47,7 percent , and for the first time since the 1950s , with a score below the level of 50 percent . 
it has said three years ago in the elections of the bundestag of 2005 , that is , at the time of so much mentioned stoiber . 
the cause can be attributed to the modernisation " devouring his parents " , put in place in the region consistently by the csu . 
it is 40 years that sociologists announcing it but they have been misled about the pace . however secularization , the results of education and the establishment of germans of the north and is in the region of bavaria , in full development , could not be without consequences on the loyalty of voters csu . 
a modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities , and the consequences of such a policy are also visible . 
the camp of the right is intact , it is only within the party that voters have become more aware , more critical and more stubborn . 
it is astonishing that in recent weeks , this is precisely the classical groups of citizens who are rather far away from csu , such as the self-employed , artisans , holders of the box and graduates of studies higher . 
in these groups , support for the csu has fallen below 40 percent . 
die press ( diepresse.com ) 
in his article entitled " who ? ? the president of the party are standing on the reserve when faced with questions of the coalition , " the conservative austrian newspaper is dealing with the internal political situation confused which has gone after the austrian elections . 
the austrian socialists sp√∂ want to discuss with the conservatives in √∂vp . 
the √∂vp prohibits the sp√∂ of meddling in its internal affairs . 
the latest populist party is open to negotiations . the greens do not want to even agree on the coalition . 
the elections took place , now everything revolves around the coalition ; during the debates on public television , the party leaders have hardly suggest their cards . 
werner faymann , president of the sp√∂ , confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the √∂vp . 
the sp√∂ wants to show that the cooperation of both parties is actually possible - it is what already exists in some regions and in the partnership socialist . 
the question that he would envision a coalition with wilhelm molter , the current president of the √∂vp , as vice-chancellor , remains open from faymann . 
as he mentioned , the orientation sch√ºssel-molterer has been , in any case , rejected . 
a replica of this combination is out of the question . 
molter reacted cautiously to the proposals of the red . 
as he has already said , a collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the √∂vp . 
in his party , the choice of the opposition or the entry in the coalition is not a question quite open . these points should absolutely be debated in the √∂vp . 
j√∂rg haider , the president of the latest , is again open to all proposals . 
" to avoid the coalition of red and black , we are ready to assume the responsibilities of government " - said haider . 
j√°r√≥ka said : we need to break the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation 
today , has started , in paris , the european summit for equality of opportunity , which the host is france , as a representative of the current presidency of the european union . 
in his message presentation in the house , as one of the main mouthpieces of the consultation with experts , l√≠via j√°r√≥ka , mep fidesz european people 's party , has drawn attention to segregation in education , because it is a violation of the law , which affects most roma children and this fact , one of the main obstacles to their success in life . 
on behalf of the french presidency , this high level conference has been opened on the one hand , by xavier bertrand , french minister of labour and social affairs , and on the other hand , by vladimir spidla , the european commissioner responsible for the work , social affairs and equal opportunities . 
among those invited to take part in the consultation , we find the european social partners , as well as the more leading representatives of the legal protection and bodies european civilians in the area of equal opportunities . 
according to the press office of the group of member fidesz party j√°r√≥ka warned that alongside the distinctions in recruitment , roma disappear from the labour market , in the first place , in the wake of their low qualifications . 
" an overwhelming majority of young roma have no qualifications of secondary school , and as a result of poor quality basic education , only a tiny part has the opportunity to get a degree of graduate studies . " 
moreover , j√°r√≥ka insisted that education as the basic right of the human being plays a key role when we must use the other fundamental rights . 
investment in early education of roma children means a strengthening the economy of the member countries of the european union . 
according to the mep , it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in a circle the widest possible , also between roma and non-roma . 
indeed , earlier a roma child starts school , more it increases its chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market ; by the taxes paid from his income and consumption , it is involved in the budget of the state . 
" by their nationality of the european union , the roma must be assured of their right to a quality education , and be protected in the education of low quality and sectarian . " - stressed l√≠via j√°r√≥ka . 
according to the member , a collaboration of the european union geared towards a target and action is necessary for an immediate speeding up the process of desegregation of schools . for this , the directives of existing anti-discrimination and in preparation is of paramount importance . 
" we need to break the vicious cycle of poverty , segregation and the unemployed . we need to give the opportunities provided by democracy to roma children , so that they can participate as citizens of full right to the future of europe " - has demanded j√°r√≥ka . 
in the name of " european year for equality opportunities " guaranteed for all , the aim of the summit to equal opportunities in europe held every year since the summit in berlin last year , is to ensure a unique platform to support the measures taken in favour of equal opportunities and the fight against discrimination , targeted at european level and at the level of member countries . 
csu : thanks for a period of transition 
it is in october that will be taken the decision on the fate of the deposed duo huber-beckstein 
despite this pitiful electoral failure , the heads are not yet fallen , and the debate on the personal issues to the top of the bavarian csu has been delayed . 
the president of the party , erwin hube and the head of the regional government , g√ºnther beckstein , can still retain their place . the question is when will last until the thanks ? 
the fate of the tandem , having suffered a catastrophic loss of voice of 17 percent , will be on the agenda of the congress of the party exceptional , held the last weekend of october . 
the members of this pair very criticised have , in any case , felt that they were not particularly to their seats . 
thanks to this , they are employed to appease the angry members of the group and the basis , which a day after the " tsunami " bavarian demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority . 
there is this five years - that is true , still under the direction of edmund stoiber , at the summit of his career - the union socio-chr√©tienne won 60,7 percent , while today , a year after the coup against stoiber , there are only 43,4 percent of their strength . 
for 46 years , the csu has been " sovereign single " of bavaria giving 18 percent of gdp german . 
but , the conservatives are still strongly in this region of the south , important key to the hungarian economy . in the future , they will be forced to the coalition . 
as one of the first signs of an internal restructuring of the party , the vice president and the federal minister of agriculture , horst seehofer , presented as a possible successor to huber , also received a place in the small group of recognition , which initiates discussions at guessing with the liberals of the fdp , and with the electeurs free , trained along the values of the right , about a possible coalition of the government of munich . 
a mockery strange fate has been that with the help of the list of electeurs free , between in legislation the gabriele pauli , including taking measure against stroiber has served as the possibility of coup perpetrated by the duo huber-beckstein , then to address bluntly the very ambitious woman municipal politics . 
now , the leaders of the csu put all their energy to stabilise , one way or another , beckstein . 
in this transition , stoiber , which until now fired the shots behind the scenes , will also receive an active role . the former head of the regional government and former president of the csu , has appointed the 28 september as the day the most bitter of his political career . 
on monday , huber has launched a few incisive observations to the cdu . according to him , they would have earned a lot more support from the party brother . 
other politicians csu have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the cdu and also for angela merkel . 
following the election bundestag , which will take place in september 2009 , merkel will again be chancellor if they call up one way or another , with a joint force , the csu , having played an important role in the national success of 2005 . 
according to merkel , difficult to hide his disappointment caused by the fiasco , the loss of ground of the csu is not playing of the grand coalition of berlin . 
which is on because it will not be easier to manage the csu injured , and the crisis of the social democrats is forever . 
since 1946 , the spd has reached its worst results with 18,6 percent in bavaria . 
lukasenko - his rivals : 110 - 0 . 
no member of the opposition came to belarus parliament after sunday 's elections . 
according to the russian monitors , this is explained by a country led by alexander lukashenko , who assure him prosperity and stability , while after the organisation for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) , this is explained by the illegalities committed during the counting of the votes . 
the osce , having sent 450 observers from 43 countries , does not recognise the elections . 
although the legislature composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million people is very well opposition for many decades , before the elections yesterday , the opposition between its forces under the name of united democratic forces ( odsz ) hoped to seriously that lukashenko , renewing its mandate of president for the fourth time in elections dubious , in the footsteps of the amendment of the constitution in 2006 , " would " this time the presence of a few members of the opposition in parliament . 
in this way , the odsz has relinquished its is boycotting originally intended . 
the fact that belarus , economically dependent on increasingly russia , would like to improve its relations with the eu , where because of the political order of belarus termed undemocratic , lukashenko and several senior politicians do not receive entry visa , was one of the expectations of the opposition . belarus has take a credit because of the decline in imports of russian natural gas , always more expensive , and has contributed to the passage of society beltransgaz ducts , owner of gas across the country , is past in the hands of the russians . 
the fact that the osce in the assessment of the campaign , has put the emphasis on the positive changes rather than on failures , such as the ban to run for a third of candidates for the opposition , was referring to an appeasement advance . 
however , the communiqu√© of the osce on monday disputed already the campaign , during which the bulk of the candidates to the opposition could not appear in the media , and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present at the counting of the votes . 
despite all this , the opposition feels quite an improvement palpable in the political regime : the political detainees have found freedom , and minsk is prepared to small confrontation with moscow , still in refusing to recognise south ossetia and the abazzia separated from georgia . however , russia with which belarus form a confederation on paper , consider the two territories independent since already a month . 
" we have two steps forward and one step back , but the most important is that the dialogue has begun between belarus and the eu " - said alexander milinkevich to our newspaper . 
according to the candidate for the opposition of the presidential elections of 2006 , it is desirable that it remains so , despite the fact that " the power was afraid in this parliament which has no weight , to get even a single opponent . " 
the opposition does not provide for actions of protests in light of the results . it is trying to get his message on the need for economic reforms with the voters . 
" of course , we have a lot of concerns of this side : we must do print our newspapers opponents in russia , local authorities we put a spanner in the works for broadcasting , but i can see also that they are increasingly to support the elections , even in the circle of older people , " - said milinkevich , referring to the fact that in the current regime of lukashenko , who consider social security as its main outcome , the layer of pensioners most supported officially no longer regard it really as appropriate . 
" because of the debt of the country and the rise of the trade deficit , the collapse of social security , " referring to the silence of a graveyard , " is just a matter of time " - think milinkevich . 
unlike the politician of the opposition , the russian observers have called the elections democratic . 
sergei lebedev , leader of the mission of the commonwealth of independent states , told the russian news agency ria novosti : " people do not believe in words but in acts .. " in this way , the absence of the opposition is proof of the maturity of the belarussian voters . 
brunetta : " from now on , breakfast before the work " . 
never in the history of the palazzo chigi therefore , not had the revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees . 
but from today , is in force this new measure against small smart , against which tip and then goes to drink coffee in the bar during working hours . 
the novelty anti lazy was presented today by the minister of public administration , renato brunetta , and by the secretary-general of the council presidency , mauro masi . 
" the doors tournantes- tells brunetta- are a tool for work better , with more productivity , more attendances and more services , " said the minister . 
now begins a new season of responsibility and transparency . 
" this is the " reformism also highlights brunetta . 
the installation in all the institutions of the council presidency is complete with the palace chigi therefore . 
according to masi , " the choice of revolving doors is important even a symbolic point of view . 
no resistance from the employees has been recorded , ensures the secretary-general : " it is a process shared by employees , and we had the cooperation of all . " 
in short , more breakfast during the hours of work ; more coffee or growing . 
promise of brunetta , which suggests smiling , " a good cappuccino at seven in the morning is an excellent and healthy resolution . " 
at a conference at the higher school of public administration 
in rome , the minister communicates that in three months , the exercise of disease of public employees are reduced by 50 % , or 60milles workers more in a year . " 
and he adds that it is essential to make more efficient , public administration . 
italian , " whose dynamic salariales- explains the ministre- these 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector , and well above the rate of inflation . 
at the same time , thousands of public employees , have united to contest the standards of the decree brunetta making use of the codacons . 
" while the minister of public office remains today the data on the decline of absenteeism in the workplace because of it caused ‚Äí writing the association of consommateurs- the people of " lazy active " continues to increase . 
indeed , in italy , thousands of employees of the public administration correct and productive , met to declare war on illegitimate standards contained in the decree . 
in particular , the tar , we doubt the exclusion of extra allowances in cases of cerebral for service ; the extension of hours of permanence domiciliaire sick worker , during which are carried out the monitoring visits , as well as other items in the new provisions advocated by the minister . 
accidents in the workplace , napolitano : " prevention crucial " 
every day , in italy , we account 2.500 accidents at work , 3 people dead and 27 people who remain disabled permanently . 
in 2007 , the data inail confirm indeed , that the white deaths have been around 1.200 . 
the figures indicate the gravity of the phenomenon , which remains one of the main causes of death , and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides . 
to get the attention of institutions , social forces and ways of information on this aspect , the dramatic anmil famous today , in all the italian provinces , the 58√®me national day of victims of accidents on the work , institutionalised the second sunday in october . 
" the worrying information provided by the anmil , as well as the tragic events of recent days , confirm the importance of the subject of prevention in the workplace , " says the president of the republic , giorgio napolitano , in a message sent to the president of the national association of anmil , maimed and disabled work , pietro mercandelli . 
the head of state expresses its " sincere appreciation for the ongoing effort associations in favour of prevention in the workplace , the protection of workers injured , assistance to the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion " 
" naturally outraged , everyone has hit its fist to put an end to such tragedies which , by their dimension , raise the clamour of media and the involvement of the public , even if the daily reality we present of the tragic cases , even repetitive in their dynamic . 
napolitano does not hide that " there is certainly a problem of resources : it is essential to invest in training and information " 
the many initiatives promoted in the school district , bear a particular importance for a more direct from the young people who enter the world of work . 
it is our duty , maintain attention to this phenomenon , not under assess the alarm on the social gravity , apply and improve the legislative standards . 
for its part , the president of the chamber gianfranco fini has highlighted how " this phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social urgency , which insult the conscience of all of us , and requires all the institutions , to make a real effort to stop them quickly . " 
the data of victims on labour seem to point out a slight positive trend , but this does not mean that the number of dead white is still impressive " has underlined later president of the anmil pietro mercandelli . 
" we do not want this " cut-price trend " will result in fact , in a minor attention , because it is precisely when attention is proof , that is the tragedy . 
" we believe that in general , it is not enough to block the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions . " 
" according to nous- stressed mercandelli- more checks and inspections are necessary , just as a greater intervention on the training of workers , and this , from school . " 
- it has ajout√©- " that we must do even an effort in relation to the communication and awareness of public opinion . 
" but it must above all , a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers faced with a phenomenon which represents a social urgency . " 
" mercandelli subsequently denounced " the progressive deterioration of the conditions to safeguard the planned compensation for the victims of the work " and the " abuse of assistance to which the system is moving in recent years " . 
" the aim is to restore the worker the insurance guarantee - it has ajout√©- so that the fate of someone who has an accident , must not depend on the spontan√©isme or enlargement of the legislator " 
mp3 player singled out , they put at risk the hearing . 
ecouter music at full volume for an extended period using portable music devices such as mp3 players , can cause permanent damage to the hearing . 
that announcement the european commission , which , in a statement circulated to brussels , quote the opinion of the scientific committee , on the health risks contingencies and recently identified ( csrseri ) of the eu , published today . 
" this report scientifique- read us in the note- it emerges that 5-10 % of those who , during a period of at least 5 years , listen to music at full volume using portable music devices , for over an hour by day and by week , risking a permanent loss of the auditory capacity . " 
" i am concerned about the fact that such a large number of young people who frequently use of portable music devices and mobile phones at full volume , can damage their hearing unconsciously so irreparable , " says meglena kuneva . 
" according to the data scientifiques- continues the responsible eu ‚Äí it is a clear risk and we must react quickly . 
what matters most is to raise awareness among consumers and make the information public domain . 
we must review in addition , the existing control systems , given the scientific opinion , so that they are fully effective and can follow the new technologies " 
brussels has asked the independent scientific committee , to discuss the issue , given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise that they generate . 
" the scientifiques-conclue the executive eu ‚Äí confirm that there are good reasons to worry about , and that the european commission will now look at with the member states and the other interested parties , what could possibly be adopted to better protect children and adolescents , against exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar devices . 
there is already a standard european security which limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100db , but the concern is growing about the hearing damage which could drift of excessive exposure to such sources of noise . 
it is possible to limit these data making use of solutions , such as reducing the levels and duration of exposure to noise . 
the scientific committee eu pointed out that the users of portable music devices , who are listening to music at full volume ( more than 89 decibels ) for five hours per week , exceeding the limits currently in force on the level of noise maximum made in the workplace . 
those who are listening to music in such conditions for prolonged periods , risk a permanent loss of the auditory capacity after 5 years . 
interested 5-10 % of users of these devices , and their number can be quantified around 2,5 and 10 million people in the u.e. 
rome , alemanno gave the order to leave the commission on the future of the capital . 
today we begin , in march , we finish , in june we learn the are . 
this is the timetable set by the capitol for the work of the " commission for the future of rome capital , " which took place this morning , at the new headquarters , behind the baths of caracalla . 
in six months , the president antonio marzano and 49 other components of the commission will put the directives for rome . 
in march when they have completed , the committee and the city council will evaluate the analyses and projects , way to present in june , the strategic plan for rome with the " official " stamp , the capitol and its mayor gianni alemanno . 
" the commission is absolutely independently ; all the political , social and cultural ideas are repr√©sent√©es- wants to emphasise alemanno- it must propose ideas for development of rome , which will be able to serve the policymakers , which remain the committee and the city council . 
no list of roles , but only the desire to have a corner where a great project for rome . 
in march , it will finish its tasks and then disappear , because this experience must have a specific time period . 
in juin-annonce the maire- we will present the strategic plan from the work done by the commission for the future of rome capital . " 
for those who accuse the commission to be unnecessary , given that his views will not be binding , alemanno replica : " it all depends on the work that the commission will be able to do , as well as the quality of its proposals . 
if the quality is there , as in france , thanks to the commission attali , as elsewhere in rome , i am on , his contribution will be crucial . 
too often the policy is frustrated by the management of everyday life and emergencies that arise from time to time . 
we , on the contrary , we want to see the before , and further , towards a deeper prospective , working seriously to the development of rome and its future . " 
in addition , the mayor of rome is keen to stress that " this commission is not a body unnecessary or a bureaucratic together : it is absolutely free , and will not cost a euro to urban romans , and used to study and get the best minds which express the capital . 
for alemanno , indeed , " we need an outline of strategic reference , neither firm or immobile , thereby allowing our city , to improve , which it has absolutely need , while thinking about its future now a spirit of unity , " . 
a future which , says the mayor of rome , " will not be the usual local borders , but who will look at further " not only in view of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of capital , but " also compared the role that rome can and should have , as a capital of europe and the mediterranean . " 
obama ? the first president anti-american . that is why . 
a famous american politician who wants to switch to independent , wrote : " barack obama will be the second president anti-american . 
the first was jimmy carter , who , by his decisions , destroyed the economy us and were reports ( as it has always today , as a private citizen ) with the enemy islam " . 
the attacks on obama are increasing as the date of the election draws nearer . 
a lady of miami , wrote on a web site : " this person is full of ambition . " 
obama is really rich : he believes that he will win the highest office of a nation that account in all , two governors and five senators blacks ! " 
in reality , it is attacks that do not say much ; these are , of course , the attacks of racial nature , and do not respond to the question of all voters : it will be a good president ? we have , in addition to the polls , who say all that obama will win and with a good advantage . 
in this case , it is also about somebody who speaks with the heart and not with the brain . 
a newspaper from the mississippi river , in the bowels of the southern united states , wrote an article : once in the voting booth , we know who the patriotic american will give its vote . 
this is now an aspect of the american mindset kept secret until the end . 
" say what you want , we will see we even put the cross , on obama or mccain . 
there are even people who swear : if obama wins , we leave the united states . 
things never revealed until now , such that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain . 
anyway , despite all these arguments , the winning card for the democrats is george bush . 
we asked 1500 people : what were the mistakes made by bush during his mandate ? 89 percent answered : iraq . 
america is changing . 
in vietnam , this nation has lost 50 miles soldiers and was sent home to kick in the butt . 
in iraq , 500 soldiers lost their lives , and the americans have not been forced to make the bags . 
despite this , iraq has been , for the most part , the point of weakness of bush . 
who will take the place of george w will be a huge task to perform . 
usa , the economic meltdown is felt even among journalists : in the press , it is time the deletions . and many accuse internet , this " murders " newspaper . 
five hundred american journalists have been arrested by the pew research center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future . 
well , almost all journalists are now pessimistic about their future . 
however , they have not declared to the attached information , feel less worried about the credibility . 
they did not feel isolated as in the past . 
the problem of american journalists , it is the money , the money . 
the crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of economic model destroyed . 
in addition , the deletions made in newsroom , in the room where the authors work to the assembly of newspapers , are a big problem . 
it is a problem that must be resolved , according to journalists interviewed , if we want the traditional journalism as the public hears it , will be reduced substantially . 
a clear but complex pessimism stormed the american journalism . 
six in ten senior executives and journalists printing newspapers are convinced that journalism at national level is currently follow a bad way . 
locally , the group executive is to 65 % . 
publication printed against broadcast . 
journalists have not difficult to see where will the web . 
the biggest houses √©ditrices their transition to the internet , seen by many as the " murderer " newspaper . 
the " economic pressure " that feel journalists is increased up to 79 % . 
the 500 journalists interviewed admitted to the technology hope that she " will do something good " for their journalism . 
today , the hitch the largest in american journalism lies between who run the newsrooms- meaning the directeurs- and the reporters who work for them . 
56 % of directors at the national level , are convinced that the reporters share their values , while at the local level , this percentage down to 23 % . 
for some , that is linked to the " safety of work . " 
the directors who think lose their job in the space of three years , are 47 % at national level . 
as far as journalists , we 're going to 30 % . 
the " work course " at the level staff ( our authors , ndr ) in america is still on the agenda . 
only 13 % of journalists working under contract . 
in a nation immense as the us , with 300 million people and thousands of journalists , magazines , radio , television and the internet , employers often provide what they want , and it is fast becoming a question to take or leave it . 
the directors receive almost always big wages , while the editor can win 10mille dollars per month , besides retirement and the payment of insurance . 
as for the holidays , the logic becomes complicated : x days after the first year , 10 days after the third , up to 15 days in all , past a number of years . 
but , according to their revelations , the american journalists , are often " sick " during the year . 
it is the fault of the climate . 
unipol : court rome , danilo coppola rest has grottaferrata . 
the president of the second section of the criminal court in rome , carmelo rinaudo , has decided to reject the body of the real estate agent , danilo coppola , who had asked to leave his city , grottaferrata , for a home in rome . 
. coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the framework of the instruction on the escalation unipol-bnl . 
during the trial , to its burden , last week it had obtained the release domiciliaire turned into residence grottaferrata compulsory . 
his lawyers , michele gentiloni and gaetano pecorella , asked that the real estate agent can go the route of the city of province for a home in the capital . 
according to the court , of such travel ( that the pm has not granted ) would allow him to influence its society and to have access to evidence that the blame . 
the elites in danger . 
the phenomenon has already shown a few days , with the vote of the house of representatives , contrary to the rescue plan of $ 700 billion approved by the white house : a significant number of americans was , and still is , more interested to punish wall street to save the american economy . 
and this is the new york times yesterday that we can confirm that the current crisis divides the republican party , even more shared between its old soul east coast , moderate favourable to federal institutions as well as to the business community , and its new soul , on the contrary , conservative , hostile to " those in washington " and in the world of finance , powerful , especially in the states of central and southern . 
the soul , rightly , that has made feel despotic way with the vote which i mentioned earlier . 
however what has been mentioned is only one example of the changes , the great changes that the earthquake economic pre-announcement or is already running : not only to the united states , but throughout the west , and can be not only that here . 
in the united states as in europe , the crisis seems to speed up the phenomena couv√©s for some time , to the point that , in the new climate , they solidifient and show themselves . 
the first of these phenomena is the overhaul , the extraordinary recovery , the double category etat- sovereign , compared to a sort of renationalisation of the economy . 
the crisis is , in fact , a crisis of institutions bancaires-financi√®res who have , obviously close relations with abroad , but , above all , are involved in a large scale , the balance sheets of individuals and families who live in one country , in a single state . 
this creates an immediate political problem for which governs : that is to say as respond to the difficulties and the protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate . 
in short , the crisis is global economically but politically , it is almost that here national . 
internationalisation policy seems to really out of the game or , has little to say : the evidence we is provided by the european union which , shared as usual , between the various interests and between the various national strategies , get to decide no line common policy . 
and so , it is the government in every state that all are waiting for speeches , rescue and recovery plans , the new rules , and above all the affection of appropriations : when you is going through a difficult period , there are the states that have the economic resources , the mass of financial resources able to try to put things in place . 
they also have the necessary resources and legitimacy to use resources : two priceless , things which no market or international organisation will never have the same way . 
this new emphasis of the crisis nation-state is in perfect harmony with the importance always major economic developments more recent the economy tend to give a factor quite linked to this element : the territoriality . 
. paradoxically , in effect , although we were convinced to now be entering the realm of the network , technology always more sophisticated , of not material , convinced that the globalised finance was now intended to dominate the world , we realized a sudden one , that our future will instead settle its accounts always more with things relatively little material such as water , harvest , oil . 
things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth , but which are definitively linked to an area praised a territory . 
so , which is sovereign , has certainly more of cards that anyone who is not , that is , anyone who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest , without oil and without water . 
i come now , with the second new that however provides a fracture . 
who says territory , state government , inevitably said political , and therefore leadership . 
in this respect , the economic crisis seems to produce two phenomena converge . 
on the one hand , the conscience of the objective need of authoritarian leadership , the search for a person who will take charge of the situation . 
on the other side , a wave of disrepute to the existing leaderships , economic species that have proven to be inadequate and full of grey area . 
and furthermore , something even more profound , in a sense , even worrying : a disrepute , suffering , an image of inadequacy , a sense of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in an increasing number of countries of the west . 
and increases even more convinced of the various classes , before the actions are the same ideas of social elites until now to their height , their way to listen to and be , their culture in the complex acceptance of the term , to have the same time , and to always be more foreign to the views of majorities . 
in short , the demand of leadership , fueling below , a powerful and branched d√©l√©gitimassions movement ruling classes and traditional political orders , which are in the " revolts electoral " improvised or , in the changes of collective whims of recent last time , from the rise in austria conservative bavaria , in the fall of labour in britain , the rebellion of delegates americans against bush ( and it may well be that the victory of the right wing in italy is not come by chance ) . 
one has the impression that the traditional elites , their parties , their programmes , but also their rites , their newspapers , their intellectuals accredited , their format , looks like someone , always have more difficulty , which does not date today , to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of western societies , and that the economic crisis strengthens , increases and wave potentially too much . 
has the view of all this , talk of a " current rebellion of the masses " to the agenda , frankly seems exaggerated . 
but it is said , keep the eyes wide open , it is not without reason . 
the supercolle to walk on the walls . 
defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue , and in the future , walk on the wall as spider . 
that is the objective of various research centres americans , and now , a team of four institutes almost succeeds . 
with a taped was barely 2,5 square centimeters , researchers have managed to maintain stuck a corps of 100 kilograms on a slope vertical . 
the etude- the american journal science published the findings of some researchers of the university of dayton , akron , of the georgia institute of technology and the air force research laboratory . 
the material , invented by the team of researchers , is an evolution of those that we know who use a particular structure carbon , called nano tubes of carbon . 
" the principle of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes prepared as a pile of spaghetti . " explains zhong lin wang of the georgia institute of technology in atlanta . 
scientists have inspired legs of geckos , covered in microscopic hairs that will ensure the animal , a perfect adh√©rente . 
the testing of various materials , such as glass , t√©flon , and the paper of glass , have demonstrated that the new stickers is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles , and at the same time , that he " stands out easily from the wall , " explains liming dai , researcher of the faculty of engineering from the university of dayton . 
walk on the walls ? - " this material could be used as stickers temporary " adds liming dai . 
can be for walking on the wall as spider ? may be that , yes , but the researchers believe a use much less fascinating as the connection between electronic appliances , given that the nano carbon tubes are drivers of heat and electricity . 
other applications could affect the aerospace engineering . 
for the moment , not super hero . 
the other recherche- the university of berkeley , california , to condemn it , too , in search of a new stickers . 
in an article in the american journal american chemical society , researchers californians have presented a taped formed of microfibres as hair , which is the auto cleans dust during the movement on an area to ensure a constant perfect and grip . 
drugs : never with fruit juice . 
attention to pamplemousse juice , orange and apple . 
these drinks , consumed especially the summer because d√©salt√©rantes and rich in vitamins , if associated with some vital medicines , distort the absorbement increasing or decreasing , according to the case , their efficiency , with consequences even serious for health . 
david nailey , a professor at the university of western ontario in london , recalls the risks of fruit juice that they are , in box or , if costs associated with the intake of certain drugs ; during the 236√®me national meeting of the american chemical society underway in philadelphia , it launches a new alarm : it is enough of a glass of juice of pamplemousse , orange and apples , to reduce the absorbement some vital medicines , cancelling their beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients . 
the juice of pamplemousse has already been strongly criticised because held responsible to increase the effects of some drugs anti arythmiques , antibiotics , tranquillizers , anti staminales and neurological toxic levels . 
medicaments has risque- it is the italian agency of the drug itself , which had given the news in a newsletter dated two years ago , alerting the doctors and patients not to under assess the danger from this mix and to pay attention to what we drink , if we take medicines such as , for example , the diaz√©pam or the methadone . 
not that the pamplemousse- according to experts , even the orange juice and apple contains substances that inhibit the medicines . 
long is the list of ingredients inhib√©s pamplemousse and the other by the juice . 
from there , the appeal of michele carruba , director of the department of pharmacology at the university of milan : " these findings are in general , immediately reported to the various national and international agencies of medicines to the need , change the notes informative medicines . 
should always read the papers proof of medicines and , if something is not clear , not to be impressed , but clearly address the doctor or pharmacist " has stressed the expert at the agency ansa . 
the nobel economics to paul krugman . 
the nobel prize of the economy has been attributed to the american paul krugman for his research on trade patterns and on the location of economic activity . 
krugman , 55 , is a n√©o-keyn√©sien who teaches at princeton university and it is also a famous writer of the new york times . 
krugman is one of the biggest critics solutions in economy and foreign policy of the bush administration . 
a few months after the attacks of september 2001 , during the days of the bankruptcy of enron , krugman wrote in an article published on the new york times , that the second event would have been more crucial that the first , in terms of the impact on the history of the united states . 
a forecast which unleashed to numerous controversies , and saw the economist for years , but which now has proved to be accurate . 
" i am surprised and even a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of enron or worldcom , have disappeared from the public 's attention , " said krugman at the end of 2002 . 
according to lorenzo bini smaghi , of the executive committee of the european central bank , krugman is a " economist of great value , " but also a divulgateur in style , " very aggressive , especially critical to the excesses of liberalism of the bush administration . 
open office , this is the third edition of the package " anti-microsoft " 
this is the day of the spread of openoffice.org.3.0 , following open source of personal productivity which aims to touch always and even more users , the home office , professionals to the public administration , proposing a free alternative to the more famous microsoft office . 
following a work of almost a year ago , carried out by developers volunteers , monitored by sun microsystem , the new package open office is to the general public with various innovations : the screen of welcome , and the interface reviewed and become less stark , to other more important , as the compatibility born to the system op√©ratif apple mac os x , and support for the new format odf ( open document format ) 1.2 , the latest version iso standard . 
open office has made particular attention to the interaction with the result office 2007 , and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new extension of microsoft ( .docx , .xlsx , .pptx. ) 
also interesting , certain functions specific to certain modules , such as reducing the dimensions powerpoint presentations , useful for example , to send them by e-mail , or import queue pdf in the module of drafting graph , retaining the original aspect of the page . 
still on this front , it is possible to create documents pdf " hybrid " that unite the graph typical of adobe format to the elements of a spreadsheet or a producer of text . 
the collaboration between several people is an element that has held various improvements to the internal applications : in the spreadsheet , various users can intervene , avoiding conflicts on the changes , in the development of texts , because each collaborator is attributed a color of comments to a greater recognition in the review phase . 
some companies are even now work to bring some functions of openoffice on the web ( the cloud on the cloud ) , and in the next few weeks , they should make the final outcome . 
the italian version is d√©chargeable at http : / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.htmlet and adds to the english version , which was on the mirror since friday . 
in addition to windows and mac os , the result is as usual available in addition , for the system op√©ratif linux . 
on demand , the cd of installation can be shipped at home or in the workplace . 
and if the issue of free can be a way to spread in the houses , it is precisely in the business , that open office is following the big challenge , which can already rely on various projects in public administration and schools . 
not counting the realities that offer a service training , consulting and assistance , ideal for small and medium-sized businesses , which could also be open to of prospective business . 
open office consists of five main modules : writer , for the video script equivalent of word ; calc , is the spreadsheet which aims to replace excel ; impress , for the rival presentations of powerpoint ; dbase , such as the famous access , is the programme that allows us to work on the databases ; finally drwa is the module graph . 
target for 2008 , reach 5 million download , and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles , it is likely that , with the exit of the new version , we could even exceed the figure planned 
kohl also , is positive , it is the fourth case of doping . 
new cases of positivity at the last tour de france : he is the team gerolsteiner , austrian bernhard kohl , qualified third , and winner of the jersey for the best climber . 
this is the site of the newspaper equipe reporting the news . 
26 years ago , kohl is the fourth cyclist positive cera epo , the third generation , after the italian riccardo ricc√≤ and leonardo piepoli , and german stefan schumacher , also gerolsteiner . 
blood tests carried out on test tubes of kohl are part of those made in recent weeks , by laboratories in lausanne and chatenay-malabry . 
if the against analyses confirm positivity at cera , the austrian will lose its third place in the tour and will have to necessarily expect two years of elimination . 
the news of the positivity of kohl to the third generation of epo , was confirmed by the head of the french agency anti doping , pierre bordry , which gave the associated press , have notified the positivity to the austrian authorities . 
the austrian 26 years has placed on the podium behind the spaniard carlos sastre and the american cadel evans , raflant outfits and peas for the best climber . 
immigres : new york times wonders if italy is racist ? 
italy " as a country of immigrants has recently become a favourite destination for immigrants " welcomed with reluctance . 
this transformerait-il the beautiful country in a nation of racist ? that is what is int√©roge the new york times who has dedicated a long article discussing the subject of racism in italy , in the case of the young abdul william guibre , originally from burkina faso , killed last month in milan , for stealing a box of biscuits . 
this case highlights what the new york times defines as the " paradox of the north " : the northern regions are both those where we are " more integration and more work , " but also " an anti-immigration sentiment the strongest of the country and the most important support to the northern league " 
to confirm the increasing tension between italian and immigrants , the nyt has also refers to episodes of intolerance of milan , parma , rome ciampino and castel volturno . 
not only that . 
even the new legislature sought by the lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants , is cited as evidence of climate change in italy . 
trend underlined by the pope and the president of the republic , " giorgio napolitano during his meeting with benedict on quirinal , has requested that the state and the church are working together to overcome racism . " 
etudiants victims of the rents ladies , up to 900 euros for a bedroom . 
the lettings market for students do not know of crisis 
according to the latest survey of sunia , the union of tenants to rent a house simple can cost a student , up to 900 euro at milan , 700 in florence , 650 to naples , 600 in rome . 
" the phenomenon has now reached very serious point to exclude entire categories of young , the right to the study because of the global costs are very high that the families of provenance must soutenir- explains the head of the office of studies of sunia laura mariani- in those cities , the strong demand from the students were so distorted the market that a process of widespread increase started even for residents . 
in most cases , the offers to hire also include a series of violations : contracts of type free , not registered , without limit in rent , sous-locations . 
for the sunia , exceptional measures through the revision of taxation , are necessary to calm prices . 
reading in detail the investigation , we see that in milan , for a bed in the area brianza , it must be around 450 euros ; for a bedroom simple , we 'll 650 euros ( minimum area nere band ) , to an average value of 800 ( lambiate area , udine , and confidence ) to a maximum of 900 euros ( area vittoria ) 
in florence , a bed costs on average , 350 / 400 euros , a bedroom around 700 euros . 
has bologna , where students are concentrated in the areas close to the university , it should be 250 / 280 euros for a bed in a double , and 370 to 500 for a bedroom simple . 
in rome , in the areas close to the central universities ( san lorenzo , piazza bologna ) asks about 600 euros for a simple , 450 for a bed in a double . 
slightly lower values ( 550 euro for a simple ) for areas close to the other universities ( ostiense and cinecitt√† ) . 
we cannot save that if you go further away in peripheral areas : 300 euro to a bed , and 450 for a simple in the area , centocelle predestina or similar . 
has naples , to a bed it must be 300 / 400 euros , for a simple , we 're spending of 400 to 600 euros , with prices highest in areas policlinico , vomero , and colli aminei . 
has bari , to bed , he must count 250 / 350 euros , at least 350 for a simple . 
in the smaller towns , the prices are low in absolute terms , but they have a major importance in the economy and cities . 
finally , cities such as perugia , in which rents are often taken by students outside the community , there is a further anomaly : the rent asked foreign students is plus 25 / 30 % compared to that applied to the italians . 
goodbye old cinema paradiso , cities √©liment historical rooms . 
the historic cinemas are closing in favour of multiplex . 
" a city without cinemas is a city blind , it is as a face with no eyes " 
the picture offered by the director giuseppe tornatore , exemplifies what happens in the major urban centres italians , but also in the cities of province , 
the process of marginalisation of cinemas , with the birth on the outskirts of big multisalles , and the death of consomption of mono rooms in central areas of cities , is one of the major events which we believe is inevitable and indisputable ; he has all the characteristics of a true crime cultural . 
has disappear , it is often the historic places and responsible of memory , " it is as if one of my friends faded , someone that we know , with which we have shared a way and so many emotions " observed the orchestrator of nuovo paradiso cinema , film that offers tornatore there 20 years ago , the first oscar and the high price of the legally binding of cannes , and which detailed the poetry of a room of province , and nostalgia for a way to live the cinema , lost can be forever . 
the figures provided by anec association , the main traders , want to just say : these past five years , 316 cinemas of traditional type have closed , and these are the rooms of the main towns which have paid the costs : 10 less to florence , 9 to milan , naples , bologna and rome , 6 in less in turin , 5 to palermo . 
among the areas most affected by the closure , the roman emily is at the top with 82 cinemas mono rooms lost , followed by tuscany ( 44 ) and lombardy ( 41 ) . 
the evidence that t confirms that the first responsible for their demise is the advent of multiplex , because it is the three italian regions that have the most new cinemas multisalles : 195 screens in lombardy in the last five years , 81 in tuscany as emilie-romagne . 
" the italian exploitation has developed irrationally " observes paolo protti , president of the anec , " it is useful to build new structures , but we do need to ensure the survival of those that already exist , because when a room firm in a city , these fr√©quenteurs are not necessarily all prepared to go to the multiplex . 
not to mention the missed deliberation of credit for traders : debt ant√©c√©dente of the state is around 10 million euros . 
it is shameful that ethical and moral point of view , the government does not respect the existing laws . 
to support the sector , it should be between 16 and 18 million euros per year . 
note the case of bologna , the first italian city that , concerned about these closures , has decided to resolve the situation with the signing of a protocol between town hall and anec , the first of its kind in italy , to defend and promote cinemas mono rooms historic centres and periphery . 
among the planned prescriptive , there are measures of tax facilities in favour of managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility : viewers will be able to enter the zone to movement limited , and will have special tariffs for the parking spaces and in some parks . 
" this is an initiative that feels right , " observed giuseppe tornatore " and i hope that other cities will follow the example of bologna putting in place other measures . 
however , it is clear that , in contrast the super power of multiplex , the traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image , because the public today is more demanding . 
the defence of the traditional cinema is a subject that for me has always been important : the closure of the supercinema of bagheria , the place of my childhood and adolescence , was the spark that has convinced me to do " new cinema paradiso " which i thought already since 10ans . 
i live in rome for 25 years , and when i go before the rialto , or the quirinal of via nazionale , now closed , where i have both experienced emotions shared , i turn on the other side not to see the panels noircis by dust . 
links between politics and " ndrangheta , arrested mayor of gioia tauro . 
" the mayor of gioia tauro was prepared to standardise the choice of the town hall to the interests of the clan piromalli . " 
heavy accusations are launched by the magistrates of the anti-mafia directorate of calabria , against the mayor and vice mayor of gioia tauro , giorgio dal torrione , as well as rosario schiavione , and the mayor of rosarno show carlo martelli 's liberal socialists , arrested this morning for externally advertised for mafia association . 
the controllers also for gioacchino piromalli , the former mediator between the clan and public administrations , and his small son lawyer , namesake of the boss , already condemned for criminal association of mafia type , as well as to pay 10 million euros . 
" an affront to the legal and moral prescriptive , and especially of common sense " write prosecutors , the two local administrations had expressed the desire to pay consultations to master piromalli . 
" so we would have been granted in the clan -√©crivent the juges- formally entering inside the halls facilitating the possibilities , already considerable , control and orientement of public administration " 
the president of the calabrian regional committee agazio loiero , does not hide the fact that " collusion between the local committees and organised crime , there are more of a " in his region : " there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others , where the collusion is almost inevitable . 
but there are also a lot of politicians who resist pressure from the ndrangheta , heroes who are honest " 
the arrests this morning follow those of july following which the police announced have d√©capit√©e piromalli the clan . 
at the end of april last year , the city council of gioia tauro had been dissolved ; already in 1991 , and always because of alleged packs between organised crime and the local administration , local politicians had been relieved of their duties to administer the city . 
giorgio dal torrione , mayor of the udc at the time of the dissolution , has been appointed head of a centre-right coalition , after the run-off in may 2006 . 
he shouted to the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council . 
it accusa vice interior minister at the time , marco minniti , accusing him of having engineered all for a political issue , but given the request of incarceration signed this morning , the judges explain that the clan piromalli had even manages to ask the variation of the draft the a3 . 
hence interception ordered against dal torrione , the pm write , is √©merg√©e " the availability to marry the requirements of a businessman , representing a group more experienced , close to the piromalli , unifying the choice of the public administration to the interests of the clan . 
when energy is born of waves , now the big throw themselves . 
this is a towering source that occupies more than 70 % of the area of the planet and now the big global companies of energy are discovered . 
waves , tidal currents , is the new renewable sources on which behemoths such as chevron have asked the eyes , and now are trying to put the hand . 
the opportunity to get energy from the movements of the sea is studied since now hundred years , and in the 1970s , in competition with the first oil crisis , the research intensified . 
when the price of oil , declined to 1980 , the idea of exploiting the marine energy was set aside , but now the bodies environmentalists and the new increase in the oil sector give a large rise 
the world energy council ( wec ) of london has estimated in 2007 that 15 % of the world need electricity could be covered by operating systems of the swells the seas . 
that amount would be twice the size that produce the nuclear power plants . 
and in addition , there would be the tides and currents .. 
giants to the attack . 
the first company to focus on energy navy has been the enersis , which in 2005 , has sigl√© an agreement to build a plant in northern portugal . 
when the agreement was announced , we would have said not a true revolutionary . 
two years ago , still more candidates among these companies doomed since still rely on traditional energy marine energy . 
" chevron is currently studying the technologies on energy oc√©anique- said the mouthpiece of a company associated with the oil colossus american business daily , the wall street journal paper ‚Äí and it assesses the possibilities to cooperate with us . " 
cooperation in question , concerns a permit deliberated by the us commission for energy , necessary to give rise to a project of exploitation of the marine energy in alaska . 
this is a very interesting signal , especially considering that precisely in alaska , the us continue to extract oil and recently , president bush has put in place a plan for new excavations 
in addition to chevron , there are verdant power inc . , of new york and ocean power of new jersey , who roam the path of energy from the sea , and the sums invested until today , although their details are known , indicate according to observers , a growing interest . 
tecnologie to point . 
the experts speak of a technology still in its infancy , from the fact that the marine energy does not dispel fears about the impact ecologist . 
currently , the systems like those of portugal , or some in scotland , are small in size , and do not seem to create big problem to the ecosystem . 
to produce energy on a large scale , however , it must use of technologies with a higher environmental impact . 
" and the choices are various : ocean power , for example , uses a system of buoys linked to each other . 
the surge of waves , which moved the sludge to the top and the bottom , is converted into a hydraulic pressure of pistons and cylinders inside the floats . 
the pressure , spin a turbine which in turn feeds a generator . 
energy is sent to the shore through cables under sailors . 
for the moment , we have four systems of this kind in phase of the project , in anticipation of a single federal approval and part of the energy could serve to a military installation . 
verdant power , on the contrary , already produces energy for a commercial centre and a parking lot using six turbines marine under the east river in new york . 
the movement of water at the tides , the blades spin turbines , creating a rotational movement which feeds into a generator . 
verdant announced have a long list of customers waiting permits needed to draw energy . 
after the waves , the tides . 
a particular interest , they say the institute for research of electrical energy , deserves at the moment , the potential of the tides . 
although it is an intermittent phenomenon , the tide is more predictable of the wind , the sun , or the waves , and therefore more reliable as a source of energy . 
and it is precisely on the energy of the tides that states like new york , maine and alaska , with others , are looking to the coast , have invested seven and a half million dollars in 2008 and provides investments up to 35 million in 2009 . 
barack obama will be the fourth american president to receive the nobel peace prize 
us president barack obama will fly away to oslo in norway , for 26 hours and be the fourth american president in history to receive the nobel peace prize . 
the diploma , the coin and the cheque of 1,4 million dollars will be called , among other things , for its exceptional efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between the nations .

it will travel first to the nobel institute , where he will meet for the first time the five members of the committee who have chosen in october of 172 people and 33 organizations . 
the planning of the presidential couple then makes a meeting with the norwegian king harald v and queen sonja . 
the visit will have its pinnacle in the afternoon at a formal ceremony where obama will receive the prestigious award . 
it will be the fourth american president to receive it , but only the third which will be awarded the prize in the very house of the committee . 
the white house was informed in advance that obama speaks of the war in afghanistan during the awarding of the prize . 
the president does not want to avoid this issue because it is aware that it receives this prize being a president who leads a war in two countries at the moment . 
it has strengthened the war effort there are still a few days in sending additional units in afghanistan , that none of its critics forget stress . 
during the ceremony , obama will also receive a gold medal , a diploma and a cheque of 10 million swedish kronor ( about 1,1 million euros ) . 
it intends to make a donation to the charity , but it has not yet decided which specifically . 
his schedule will take it then as well as his wife to a banquet including , in addition to the king and queen of norway , the head of government and 250 other guests . 
obama was rather reluctant to this prize at the beginning . 
he mentioned , for example , have the sense of not earn it fully . 
he also repeated several times that it is not a price for him alone , but for all those who defend the same values as him . 
since the announcement , it said that it would be for him a " invitation to act . " 
a defender of nature accused of blackmail 
the police litomƒõ≈ôice blackmail has indicted the president of the association society of protectors of the nature of litomƒõ≈ôice . 
several times last year he appealed for a number of procedures of construction sites and asked for money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal , said nafta romov√° , spokesman for the police to litomƒõ≈ôice . 
the president of the society of protectors of the nature of litomƒõ≈ôice lubom√≠r studniƒçka is . 
it is currently in custody and risk up to three years in prison . 
the dumpsters waste sorting are not to fragrance to brno 
in prague everyone can separate its packaging of drinks , while in the villages of south moravia you fall on dumpsters sorting on every street corner . 
and brno ? 
here , you should take several minutes before finding the dumpsters adequate . 
i do not want to say we do not trierait at all the waste to brno . 
but i have the impression that the councillors from our town , the second largest city in the country , are not interested enough to this problem . 
brno is to the stone age of the sorting of waste not only because people cannot yet sort that the paper , glass and pvc , but especially given many dumpsters dedicated to these waste . 
have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city ? 
it is a science , which requires above all the time and nerves of steel . 
the only place i found for the moment , this is the place of the moravia in front of potrefena husa . 
that mr onderka and his colleagues do not want to , but it seems to me damn little . 
not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city that is not an easy task , either . 
and finally , a lot of my friends do not trient their waste . 
by laziness . 
it made a actually going on to get the dumpsters . 
it does not surprise me on their part . 
myself , after a party , i have offered to go throw some glass bottles and pvc . 
except that i saw no bin of color kounicova street . 
fortunately i have found the right place going take the tram . 
that said , the waste were full to overflowing . 
it is , after all , the centre of brno , which is supposed to represent the best the city , not ? ! 
it is probably that ecology and a so-called aesthetic do not interest too the socialists in brno . 
they prefer to buy the city a place at first hockey league which is a disgrace to the city throughout the country , instead of buying a few additional dumpsters and propose sorting more raw materials for a brno cleaner . 
i am pleased to have been able to support my impression with official statistics having dragged a time on the internet . 
according to data from the company eko-kom , brno really is the worst of the entire region south moravia . 
the budget of paroubek claimed the argentaux pensions and the sick leave 
after that the left has increased , despite the opinion of the government , the farmers or even officials it may be that there is a lack of money for the pensions , the sick leave or savings housing . 
but also for the interest on the debt of the state or the international court proceedings . 
this will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year , says the finance minister eduard janota . 
when the social democrats and communists imposed the increase for some classes , they were based on the fact that the government will make loans for sensitive expenditure , pensions or leave disease . " it is not that put the problems in later , undermine the ground , " said janota . 
we should be aware that the interest on money borrowed to pay are increasingly high and that it will take the return sooner or later . 
the state has not really the choice about where to draw money . 
if it does not fall social aid or its spending , it will have to raise taxes . 
to all those that the left has now increased : firemen , teachers , farmers . 
and afterwards , to their children . 
the people will affect and should not fear for their pensions or their insurance , including 1,8 billion have disappeared . 
but at the expense of a larger state indebtedness - next year it will therefore not 163 billion in the coffers , but more . 
despite the efforts of the minister and janota debt will grow more quickly , and with it the expenses related to the interests . 
the state will need money for the repayer and it will not do to increase slightly vat or reduce the maternity leave as the government in its anti-d√©ficit package . 
it will also miss five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to some groups of voters . 
it is mainly of sections already decided and begun to which it is not possible to change the projects to reduce possibly costs . 
at most , which is not free , either . 
this means delay or stop 30 major sites , and the removal of european funds is also in danger , according to the warning from karel hanzelka , spokesman of the ministry of transport . 
the ƒçssd has proposed to resolve the financial deficit very effectively - it will draw from the dividend for ƒçez ( supplier and distributor of electric energy ) , that the state has in bulk and will fuel the fund transport . 
the concern is that the dividend is never certain and that it is in no way a puit without substance . 
last year , there are 18 billion which have been navigu√©s since the ƒçez until in the budget . 
every year , dividends are used to pay for the removal of environmental damage , to supplement the accounts of pensions or serving in reserve for pension reform , which is preparing . 
moreover , this trick increases the real deficit in the budget to the tune of 5,7 percent of gdp , according to the eu rules . 
and that is far from being the end of the carnival of transfers . 
the budget for various damages to the victims of communism and crime , even the savings housing , has fallen by nearly three billion . 
it is not certain that the state can act without this money . 
this is a lottery . 
if we lose a international procedure , we must in any way the pay , note janota . 
the minister will then save on the side of the department or , in the worst case , touch the budgetary reserve of the government . 
it also lacks a hundred million cash for the project to a value of two billion , which should make it possible to follow online what are the expenditure of every administration . 
the first step will begin in january . 
if the finance minister does not find money elsewhere , the project will have to be stopped and sanctions would take place , warns janota . 
your next smart phone controlled two operating systems 
in the future , the americans are planning a mobile phone that will enable the user to move from an operating system to another pressing one button . 
the plans were revealed that seem promising . 
it is enough of a button and you spend for windows mobile android in seconds . 
it is precisely this possibility which is the goal of american society vmware , which primarily software development of virtualisation for computers . 
we are going to allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone . 
you can cycle between them , you can differentiate into personal and professional 
the two will work at the same time , indicated srinivas krishnamurti of society vmware in an interview for the magazine computerworld . 
it was presented in november last year and it has already been a first demonstration there are a few days . 
it will be on the market in 2012 . 
the virtualisation on the phones is no fiction . 
vmware has already presented a successful test version to journalists , of a smart phone equipped with two operating systems . 
it is a nokia n800 changed with a memory of 128 mb ram , which ex√©cutait simultaneously the systems windows mobile and android mentioned . 
the development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming . 
the society vmware will now work with the european and us operators to test the virtualisation on smart phones , and customers should have access to the equipment course 2012 . 
the shortage of snow in the mountains worried hoteliers 
the courses are deserted , pose no problem that remonte-pentes operators . 
the lack of snow deters people to book their stays in hotels to cross-country skiing and pensions . 
because of this , it is still possible to find chambers free for all the dates in winter , including the christmas and new year . 
we have a lot of visits on our site . 
internet users roam the tender , asking prices , but dare not commit to set aside for the moment . 
and if they call us , they demand immediately if there will be snow or mud at christmas , " said martin jandura , operator of the portal of information spindl.info. 
if you want to spend new year of his dreams to ≈°pindler≈Øv ml√Ωn , better not too hesitate to reserve . 
if you give priority to economies and that the quality of accommodation is just then , then we can try to wait a few more days . 
hoteliers of ≈°pindler do not propose for the moment that stays a week for the new year . 
i think they will try again , a moment of the place , but they c√®deront them and will accept a shorter period . 
and then the number of free chambers will quickly reduce , " has estimated jandura . 
the agency of tourism ingtours of vrchlab√≠ also proposes more beds free for all periods of winter . 
the week of christmas we 're most interested for the moment , it is not completely sold . 
there is still free , say , half of the chambers in our offer . 
that is why we have already prepared a stays of christmas last minute cheaper , " said the director of ingtours petr schiefert . 
the agency vrchlab√≠ tourism can also propose the new year to krkono≈°e , but there are fewer places free . 
the 14 days of february leave as well , stays remaining winter sell moderately . 
this year , the interest for stays of winter has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow to krkono≈°e . 
people expect that it will start to fall . 
nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountains with snow . 
if the avenues overlapping during the week , christmas also will be complete , " think schiefert . 
conversely , the occupation of the hotel horizont to pec pod snƒõ≈ækou is slightly higher than last year . 
it was an improvement of about five percent . 
we still have few places for the new year as for christmas . 
there is a great interest during the holidays in january of poles and february sells well also , " informs karel rada , director of the best hotel of cep . 
the hotel omnia near the central park j√°nsk√© l√°znƒõ is also to eighty percent during the period of the new year . 
on the contrary , half remain empty beds at christmas in the most recent j√°nsk√© l√°znƒõ hotel . 
this year , we have been pleasantly surprised by the month of january , where we have already sixty percent of occupation at the moment . 
february is a little lower for the moment , but as soon as the snow is falling , the interest for stays in the krkono≈°e builds certainly still has indicated the director of the hotel omnia , erik sporysch . 
hoteliers of krkono≈°e must not , however , expect more snow . 
on thursday we will be fresher and if there are rainfall , they should be neigeuses in the mountains . 
but then , the time should be warmer , informs ji≈ô√≠ jakubsk√Ω the hradec station of the institute hydrom√©t√©orologique czech . 
united states : repetition is mother of wisdom 
it is comical even , the painstaking effort with which barack obama , president to the reputation of wise , reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on the afghan question , that he considered himself as very simple . 
when he eventually leave sweat its doctrine if eagerly awaited , it turned out that he had recopi√©e carbon paper since the iraqi scenario bush for three years . 
not content to use in the text itself several times the expression " as in iraq , " he has not hesitated , what is more , to use the title of the speech bush 's january 2007 as the title of his own speech : " a new way forward " 
at the same time , he has personally criticised the idea of bush to send new reinforcements in an iraq burned by the civil war as " irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its consequences . " 
the following month , however , have shown that the strategy of bush , who came out of the recommendations of the commanders campaigns , was the only possible and likely success to such a point that the newspapers at the present time do not speak of all of iraq . 
this has not enhanced the reputation of bush , it said , objectively speaking , it was left to his successor a final situation much more favourable than we might expect . 
barack obama hope that in afghanistan , the miracle will reproduce 
this is again the commanders of campaigns that asked him to an increase in the military , including the commander of the operation in afghanistan , general stanley mccristal , which has even severely criticized the reluctance of the white house despite the habits of subordination . 
it called 40 000 men in order to make the situation more favourable . 
the president has hesitated for three months but for lack of a better option , at least it has conned the general of 10 000 soldiers . 
he has managed to extricate the promise of additional 5 000 from europe , even if he was counting on 10 000 in origin . 
what brings the most problems throughout the strategy of obama seems to be its intention to withdraw the armies of afghanistan by 18 months and to finish this whole process within three years . the entire doctrine of obama brings more questions than it provides answers . 
many have doubts about the fact that an increase of half will bring the same fruit that progress in iraq . 
despite the fratricidal wars of recent years , iraqi society is relatively well organised and its leaders honouring the agreements . 
the afghan situation stands out for the exact opposite - we cannot rely on person and no treaty is respected . 
in these conditions , it is difficult to prepare afghan security forces , accustomed to change leader the day to day according to what suits them . 
the political institutions , although based officially , will remain that the wool over the eyes behind which will proliferate the patriarchal ethnic relations . 
it is singularly complex to balance the interests of various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity on the reports , which are still complicated by the pakistani and iranian influences . 
even the foundation of a state " quick to act , " which is the aim of the operation , does not seem to be very real . 
the time horizon of the strategy of obama makes puzzled by his determination . 
in the past eight years , the situation in afghanistan has only worsened and she is now on the brink of chaos . 
only a heart purely romantic and outside the reality can be convinced that the small soldiers sent in the tumult of the war for their " swift return to the house " will bring a real miracle . 
from a political point of view , set a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the taliban see it as the admission indirect american defeat . 
the last nato summit has shown that the will of the europeans to take part in military operations in afghanistan is moving towards the negative . 
european politicians do not know or do not want to explain to their constituents what security in germany or italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the hindu kush . 
another factor capable of altering radically the situation is the development of events linked to iran . 
if the situation continues to deteriorate and that sanctions strengthened do not have effects on the iranians , americans will find themselves faced with the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force . 
it will respond by example when , according to obama , america will the victorious withdrawal of troops from afghanistan . 
every solution of this type will , however , a dramatic reversal of the afghan situation . 
the only swept for obama is the fact that there are still three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for that it is working on a new strategy , in case it emerges as a flop . 
the leaders of the bank goldman sachs will not receive cash bonuses 
employees senior leaders of the american bank goldman sachs will not receive bonuses this year in cash . 
the company announced in response to strong criticism of its pay practices . 
the group of 30 main leaders will receive actions instead of money , they will not sell for five years . 
the actions can be withdrawn from the leaders in case they take too many risks . 
according to reuters , goldman sachs arises as head of the effort to link rewards with long-term performance on wall street . 
i assume that wall street is well aware of the overall sense that we need to take , said the former investment banker douglas elliott of society jpmorgan 
the concern is in the details , he added . 
goldman sachs bank has become the target of criticism after being set aside almost $ 17 billion in premiums on the first three quarters of this year . 
for the current year , the total amount of the premiums will likely exceed $ 20 billion in spite of the measure announced today , according to reuters . 
with the arrival of the financial crisis , the strong premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries . 
britain announced wednesday that it intended to affect a single tax 50 percent bankers " bonuses exceeding 25.000 books . 
france is preparing similar measures . 
this year , the women have won nobel prize in all areas except physics 
five women , a record number , which have received today to stockholm from the hands of the king of sweden charles xvi gustave the nobel prize in technical disciplines and literature . 
in addition to the four scientists there was also the german writer of romanian origin herta m√ºller . 
two american biologists , elizabeth blackburn and carol greider received with their fellow countryman jack szostak the nobel prize in medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes . 
the price of chemistry has been awarded to the israeli ada jonath with the americans venkatraman ramakrishnan and thomas steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes 
the last winner has received the nobel prize in economics , the american elinor ostrom with his countryman oliver williamson , for their analysis of economic governance . 
the only technical discipline which has not been winner this year has been the physical . 
the prize was awarded today to scientists charles kao for his research in the field of optical fibres and george smith avecwillard boyle for their invention ccd chips , which are currently on the basis of all digital cameras , fax or glasses astronomical . 
each winner received a diploma , the nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the award process . 
it reached 10 million swedish kronor in each category . ( approximately 1,1 million euros ) 
if one of them contains several winners , they will share the reward them . 
the very waited nobel peace prize has been awarded this afternoon at oslo in norway to president barack obama . 
this , in his speech , has acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward because there is that at the beginning of her record and that it is in addition to the head of a country engaged in two wars - in iraq and afghanistan . 
to the discharge of its policy he added that in certain situations the war is essential for peace , even if the price is high . 
the minister janota plans to resign . klaus has invited in the castle 
president v√°clav klaus will receive friday morning , the finance minister eduard janota verbatim , his stay in government because of its disagreement with the state budget for next year as it was passed by the chamber of deputies 
it is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of janota the cabinet will be on the agenda of their appointment on friday . 
klaus also criticises the budget . 
according to him , the deficit is too important , which is widening the public finance crisis . 
it is the presidential spokesman radim ochvat which has informed of the meeting . 
janota then discuss his office on monday with prime minister jan fischer . 
according to the legislation on the budget , which will be submitted to the signing of klaus , it is a deficit of 163 billion kronor that the czech republic should manage . 
however , the house of representatives has approved wednesday the proposals of the left about the money transfers and has increased the rewards of officials , the workings of social services and direct payments to farmers . 
the government blamed the proposals of the social democrats , the fact that they would increase indirect way the budget deficit . 
for this reason , a violent disagreement is born between the left on the one hand , the government , klaus and right on the other hand , disagreement which calls into question the future of the cabinet of fischer , who had been trained by agreement between the ods , the ƒçssd and the green party . 
critics say that the budget , as it was voted by members , removes the package of measures of economies past by the government of fischer and which must according to him stem the indebtedness of the state . 
klaus , who can ratify the law on the state budget , but that nothing be done , said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs , that the policies have long neglected the " serious problem " of " irr√©fr√©nable deficiency " of public finances . 
now there is , according to him , no solution in favour . 
only a strong government could bring an improvement , if he could rely on a consensus of political parties wider , according to the president . 
the president of the ods mirek topol√°nek has indicated that the budget is staggering and that the government should call into question its existence later . 
the vice-president of the ods petr neƒças told the ƒçtk that the idea of a cabinet administrative supported by the ƒçssd , the ods and the greens is obviously more . 
in its response , the prime minister fischer has called such words of " drastic verdicts . " 
the head of ƒçssd ji≈ô√≠ paroubek reacted against topol√°nek , saying that the deficit in the budget for this year by the former government of topol√°nek is staggering and that it will exceed 200 billion kronor . 
on wednesday , already , the ƒçssd described success the ratification of the state budget for the next year .

morgan freeman will play mandela in the new film eastwood clint 
despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by actors americans , the south africans claim that the new film hollywood invictus - unbeaten will set out in the world a lot of things on the country , its fighting and its victories . 
the story is about sport , relations between races and nelson mandela . 
morgan freeman , american actor rewarded to the oscars , embodies the film about the life of nelson mandela , a tireless fighting against the racist apartheid system in south africa and first black president . 
freeman said , that this is a mandela aged ninety-one years who asked him to be in the film . 
matt damon plays another important role . 
i told him : " if i have to embody , i should be able to see you personally .. 
the actor aged 72 years which has been rewarded for a price for its role in the drama milion dollar baby of clint eastwood located in the middle of boxing has , for example , embodied the leader of a movement against slavery itself become a slave , a us president shadow , or even god in the film evan almighty but never someone alive and also important for so many people that is mandela . 
the state ex-homme south africa has been jailed 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in south africa . 
it was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years . 
in 1993 he was awarded the nobel peace prize . 
invictus is a latin word meaning unbeaten and this is the title of a poem in the english author william ernest henley published in 1875 . 
the challenge was to speak as him . 
the film tells the true story of the joint efforts of nelson mandela and the captain of the team of south african rugby fran√ßois to unite the country . the newly elected president mandela knows that his country is still and always divided racially and economically after apartheid . 
it is sure to be able to unite his people by sport and decides to unite the rugby players that are among the " outsiders " in the global rankings . 
the south african team will eventually move forward in world cup in 1995 . 
freeman has worked a few years to bring the history of mandela on big screen . 
i had no other purpose otherwise play this role in order to bring the more the reality , said freeman . 
the biggest challenge for me it was , of course , to speak like him 
the actor has said that if he and human international policy were in the same region , it would have tried to meet mandela , dinner with him , to be backstage before his speech . 
the most important thing for him was him shake hands . 
i realized that when i say greenhouse hand , i save your energy , it is transmitted and i had the impression of how you feel , he said . 
it is important for me to try to become another person . 
matt damon plays in the film fran√ßois pienaar , the captain of a national team of rugby in which there is a majority of white players . 
the actor has said that he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard middle of rugby . 
for him , his first meeting with pienaar at his home has been a great surprise . 
i remember when i come to the door of the house , he has opened and the first thing i said to francois pienaar was : " i have the air much bigger in the movie . " 
despite the differences between the actors and models real , invictus under the leadership of the filmmaker eastwood has received positive opinions and there is even talk of ambitions for the oscars . 
the criticism of films todd mccarthy of the newspaper daily variety summarized his appreciation in these words : " it is a very good story , a film very well done . " 
in the evaluations of films on the site rottentomatoes.com , invictus received 76 percent of positive assessments . 
the mystery of the will in norway is resolved : the russians tested a rocket 
there has been a phenomenon strange light of unknown origin above norway . 
the ministry of defence has recognised that russian yesterday have tested a rocket intercontinental ballistic not far from norwegian borders . 
the launch , however , has been a failure , and the missile " bulava " which was originally scheduled to be the pride of the russian army is gradually becoming the nightmare of the russian generals and prime minister vladimir putin . 
his presence repeated during the tests of the rocket has not had the desired effect on the success of the test flights . 
most of the time , or bulava has not disappeared , or it has damaged in full flight . 
russian newspapers talk of " bulava " as the " missile that is not " 
a missile that is not but that shines 
this 13th trial was taking place in the beginning normally . 
it is only at the end of the flight that there was once again the damage on the equipment . 
this is clearly the engine of the third stage of the rocket that exploded . 
this time , " " bulava soared nuclear submarine dmitrij donskij which was sailing under the surface of the white sea . 
this type of missile can be precisely set on fire in a boat in movement and immersed 
that is why the mysterious light above norway caused by an unidentified flying object precisely has probably been by a " bulava " flawed . 
the rest , the norwegians have not doubted a moment that it is a russian rocket . 
the generals argue that this time , we cannot talk absolutely of failure . 
the two first floors of the rocket has resisted and the damage has not affected than the third . 
in the previous cases , engines have experienced failures on the first floor . 
even if none of the test launches happened smoothly , the direction of the ministry of defence considers that only six on 13 have been failures . 
this success rate of almost 50 percent fills so the generals of optimism and they say therefore always that one day " bulava " fly without problems and that it will even ten nuclear cores hypersonic a total weight of 1,15 tonnes .

hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime 
the direction of the plant hyundai of no≈°ovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime . 
it is precisely because of the extra hours frequent the trade unions have declared a state of emergency strike on monday . 
the spokesman petr vanƒõk of the plant hyundai has confirmed . 
the direction , however , wants to come to agreement with the unions on a saturday worked this year . 
we cannot abandon our plan of production , it is essential , this is why overtime volunteers have been proposed on saturday , 19 december knowing that there would be two teams , said vanƒõk . 
the site sedmiƒçka.cz has indicated that the company has proposed a 400 czk bonuses to employees who would be part of the team on saturday . 
it will be awarded has also afterwards for the day worked on 28 november . 
the company , according to vanƒõk , has decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime . 
either they receive the surcharge for the hours in more , or they can pose a replacement leave on 28 december and extend their new year celebrations aindiqu√© vanƒõk . 
in addition to that all employees present on saturday will receive compensation for the costs of transport and for their lunch . 
given the fact that the extra hours were the most urgent and the warmer in the comments , and the demands of unions as employees who have ceased spontaneously production last week , the management has taken the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of december , said vanƒõk . 
until last week , employees of the car factory were forced to work almost daily two extra hours in more of their eight hours . 
the unions are cancelling the state to strike after signing the agreement . 
the following negotiations between the direction of the car factory and the trade unions must take place on friday afternoon . 
union leader petr kucha≈ô said wednesday that they were ready to stop the state to strike in the event of agreement on their demands and signing of a joint document . 
the situation in the factory culminated last wednesday when nearly 400 employees have started spontaneously on strike because of constant overtime . 
they were protesting against the bad conditions of salary and so-called bizutages . 
the leadership has defended with the fact that the employees had to work as a supplement to fulfil the imperatives of production of cars . 
during the announcement of the strike on monday , the unions have also asked that the employees who have ceased production are not subject to any penalties . 
the unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum . 
they want this year a reward of 5 million kroner ( 209 about ‚Ç¨ ) for them . 
the car factory hyundai of no≈°ovice currently employs 2 000 people . 
it began series production last year in november . 
she has made about 80.000 vehicles until september of this year , with a production capacity of 200.000 cars per year . 
czech discovery : a substance that works on the hiv virus " hard-working people also " 
a team of scientists czechs and germans is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of hiv in the body . 
the main advantage of the substance improved is that it is also on the viruses that have already developed an immunity to medicines . 
this is , in some cases , the upper hand on the fact that the combination is not as intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available . 
it is not possible to cure aids at the moment . 
nevertheless , we can extend radically the lives of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of hiv in the body . 
their consumption causes , however , a number of side effects . 
more repression of this increase for the development of so-called drug resistant viruses on which drugs have more effect . 
the work of experts from three institutions , the academy of sciences of the czech republic , the v≈°cht in prague and the university of heidelberg paves the way for a way to cope with the resistance of the virus . 
they have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the hiv virus . 
the metalocarboranes are an assemblage of bore , of hydrogen , carbon and cobalt . 
this combination is blocking the development of the virus in a different way of all medicines employees so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of the resistance . 
the work of researchers leads them to discover new substances " improved " , on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their routes on the proteins of the virus . 
the metalocarboranes have a single three-dimensional structure : two cages to multiple walls are trained by atoms of bore , of hydrogen and carbon and connected by a metallic atom , in this case the cobalt . 
a virus traitor and resilient . 
the retroviral of hiv is a protein from the hiv virus which is essential to the life cycle of the virus . 
without the division of the hiv virus caused by the retroviral hiv there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus . 
if we stop the retroviral of hiv , there also stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient , explain the researchers in a press release issued by the institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the academy of sciences of the czech republic . 
in their work , published in the scientific journal journal of medicinal chemistry , scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages ( see picture ) are connected by a short link organic , which is then systematically altered . 
a little weaker but more reliable . 
the effectiveness of this series of substances on the prot√©ases of hiv has been tested in test tubes , and on its variants resistant , obtained from patients infected with hiv . 
on the current version of the enzyme , the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on the clinical medicine , however it is not diminishing on the versions resilient against which medication currents are often ineffective . 
the metalocarboranes , with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties as their biological and chemical stability , their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are therefore combinations interesting to examine more to move towards the development of effective medicines against hiv , says pavl√≠na ≈ôez√°ƒçov√° , director of the laboratory of structural biology institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and the institute of molecular genetics of the academy of sciences . 
dispute over the budget . the ods is fischer , who defends 
the president of the civic democratic party ( ods ) , mirek topol√°nek called the " staggering " ratified the budget for the next year and according to him , the government of prime minister jan fischer should question its existence . 
the prime minister has described the words of the ods of drastic verdict . 
he said take time to analyse . 
the spokesman of the ods petr neƒças said that the idea of a cabinet administrative supported by the ƒçssd , the ods and the green party got more clearly . 
according to neƒças , the head of the government should decide whether ilprend to the chamber of deputies support on the minority who cares to combat the growing deficit , or if he cares to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left . 
neƒças has warned that the positions of the ods and social democrats in relation to the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed . 
the chamber of deputies ratified on wednesday , the budget for 2010 , but with the proposed changes to the tune of 12 billion kronor included by the left . 
the house has increased the money for the salaries of officials , the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers . 
the government 's complaint against the proposals of the social democrats , was the fact that they grew indirectly the budget deficit . 
the czech republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion kronor . 
the ods has left the chamber before the vote , obeying the desire of the government and what a budget changed is a variant less bad than an interim budget . 
disappointment and uselessness 
the finance minister eduard janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility , the prime minister jan fischer said that the government will still think about the current situation . 
neƒças is convinced that if janota threatened to leave his post in case of ratification of the proposed changes , the situation could be different . 
according to the czech television janota has made an appointment on monday with the prime minister after its passage in government : 
he said at the same time that he wondered if it was going to remain in office . 
his disappointment about the negotiations on the budget is the reason . 
if fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit , neƒças believes that the representatives of the ƒçssd , which have imposed the changes of the budget , do not have their place in the government . 
the prime minister should also make clear that he resign if the house ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit such as those affecting insurance , pensions , or the reform of the law on services . 
topol√°nek : ministers appointed by the ods are not in question . 
this is the case of the head of the government fischer and the government . 
the ministers appointed by the ods did nothing detrimental , stressed topol√°nek text in a press release from the united states . 
he pointed out that the deputy ministers of some ministries claim of top 09 , which voted against the budget . 
neƒças stressed that if fischer decides to give his resignation in the face of the lead a fight against the amount of deficit in public finances , " it is entirely logical and proper that it is based on the majority of the left which is currently in the house . " 
that said , it should not be expected to support and tolerance of democrats . 
i had not thought and once it will be the order of the day so i will dedicate , said since the house to journalists , the defense minister martin bart√°k , elected to the government by precisely the democrats . 
the prime minister fischer has soared in the afternoon for a debate of the european council in brussels . 
the ods has backtracked at the request of the prime minister . 
neƒças stressed at the same time that the ods would probably have voted on wednesday against the budget changed if it did not expressly asked members democrats allowing the vote of the budget . 
we do not have the feeling of being orphans , it is no small children , it has responded to the question of whether the ods had not suffered accusations from the president of the party in the house or in the country during the negotiation of the budget . 
i have not noticed that my vote would have been lacking . 
i already knew at the time i renounced my mandate that what would follow in the coming months would be a bolch√©visation of the house and a destruction of all that was positive , reacted topol√°nek in person . 
according to the new hours of the ƒçd there will be less trains for the same charges . 
the railways czechs will remove or limit from 13 december some regional express trains or less responsible and instead would increase some others . 
the full coverage of transport will fall on the day of entry into force of the new hours of two percent compared to today . 
most of the charges will not change , including the tariffs of basis and the reduced rates . 
this , for example , are the people of the region of ostrava who will have more connections to the capital , the railways will add a pendolino row .

there will also be less fast trains on the line prague - p√≠sek - ƒçesk√© budƒõjovice , the direct line prague - letohrad will be drastically reduced . 
regionally , the biggest reduction in transport is the region of hradec kr√°lov√© eight percent in total , however prague and its environs can celebrate an increase . 
two night trains on the line prague - t√°bor - ƒçesk√© budƒõjovice are also cancelled and the movement of some express trains on the line prague - p√≠sek - ƒçesk√© budƒõjovice will be reduced to just a few days in the week . 
among the major changes , you can see the introduction of a new direct line of milovice prague : for the moment the inhabitants of milovice must change to lys√° nad labem . 
it is the fifteenth line of suburban esko system , including the opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between lys√° nad labem and milovice . 
the lines distant towards the capital will have their final destination at the main railway station in prague ( praha hlavn√≠ n√°dra≈æ√≠ ) . 
the ƒçd will introduce more sc pendolino lines between prague and ostrava and trains to ≈°umperk / jesen√≠k will leave by intervals of two hours . 
travellers can no longer take the pendolino until bratislava from 13 december . 
the bill this year for the regional railways : 200 million kroner . 
express trains are ordered and paid by the ministry of transport and will pay the railways next year in all four billion kronor to settle the losses visible , is the same amount that this year . the regional trains are ordered by the regions which will pay for their by a total of eight billion next year , knowing that the state will participate to the tune of nearly three billion . 
this year , the regional trains are 200 million more expensive . 
the railways have newly signed a contract for ten years , until now the duration was always a year . 
the railways appreciate the system , which also explains that they do not have resorted to a price rise of the vast majority of securities of transport . 
the changes will affect only the notes of a day ƒçd net and the internet eli≈°ka notes at lower prices . 
for travellers without map of reduction , the price of net ƒçd increase of 450 to 600 kronor . 
the price of eli≈°ka newly will depend on the miles , while there was valid between cities in a region in choice and was in a single rate of 160 kroner .

janƒçura will sue for libel against three prefects the ƒçssd 
radim janƒçura , owner of student agency , will submit today complaint for slander against three prefects social democrats . 
and specifically against michal ha≈°ek region south moravia , against radko mart√≠nka region of pardubice and against the prefect of the region of olomouc martin tesa≈ô√≠k . 
janƒçura indicated in dvacet minut of radio≈æurn√°l . 
the complaint is linked to the attempt of society to exploit regional railways in some regions . 
all the regions , however , have ended up sign long-term contracts with the railways czechs . 
all three have attacked and claim that the fine mouths , while there has only made an offer for what they wanted to themselves . 
they claim that we are more expensive than the railways czechs which is not true because we know the price of railways czechs were signed last week . 
so we just have to defend ourselves . 
it is in exchange of slander on society student agency , said janƒçura on radio≈æurn√°l . 
similarly , he said have evidence that no region has not made in agreement with the european law . 
we are preparing for this a complaint to the european commission . 
ha≈°ek considers that the complaint of mr janƒçura is the result of his media spectacle of free publicity for its society and for his person . 
of course , i am prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and i call on other prefects to do likewise . 
i suppose that this will be the opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely mr janƒçura manipulates the public and resorts to arguments false and misleading about the regional rail transport , says ha≈°ek 
janƒçura has already informed last week that it will invest a few million kronor in an advertisement which will include the steps unfavourable regions . 
he has said to radio≈æurn√°l that it will stop the campaign after christmas and that it intends to resume after the new year . 
he has stated that the campaign will aim the corruption in the broad sense . 
janƒçura began its campaign after the regions have agreed to give the railways czechs the exploitation of rail links to a command of about 150 billion kroner , without issuing tender . 
according to janƒçura , such an action is illegal and contrary to the position of the european court of justice . 
according to him , his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to janƒçura threats of a member of the ƒçssd . 
the only threat has been that if one does not stop , we could lose our bus licences . 
he presented himself as a member of the ƒçssd , i do not know who it is , but i will not say his name , said janƒçura today at radio≈æurn√°l . 
vaccination against the pneumocoques will be free and voluntary 
vaccination against the pneumocoques will reverse the old habits as early as january . 
it will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families . 
the voices already , saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective . 
the preparations for the introduction of vaccination against the free pneumocoques culminent . 
the pharmaceutical institute already defines the maximum price for vaccines that will pay the insurance . 
the experts also see clear in the process of vaccination . 
a new vaccination . 
free vaccines for children of august . 
since january , children born last year from august 2 , can be vaccinated against the pneumocoques charge . 
the condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated . 
if you started vaccination last year or earlier , you will have to pay yourself the following vaccination . 
the first dose of vaccine should be administered between the third and the fifth month of the child . 
last year a quarter of families has voluntarily vaccinated their children against the pneumocoques . 
yet parents paid skr 1 or more for a dose . 
the vaccination of younger requires four doses . 
specialists estimate that every year the insurance spend 300 to 450 000 kronas in doses of vaccine . 
they save however on medical care that the unvaccinated children might require . 
so far the state spent approximately 500 000 kroner per year for any vaccination of children . 
the vaccination repaid was introduced with the " package janota . " 
the pneumocoques are the cause of inflammation of the middle ears but also serious infections whose m√©ninges and inflammation of the blood poisoning . 
according to surveys in hospitals , until 28 deaths of children under 10 years caused by infections pneumocoques . 
apart from the czech republic , about 40 other countries have introduced vaccination repaid . 
it will be mandatory vaccination ? 
there are opinions on a possible obligation of vaccination in the future . 
from january , it must be settled by insurance and voluntary . 
for example , the president of the association nahlas rudolf kalovsk√Ω has indicated that a compulsory vaccination would be more positive . 
his association promotes long vaccination against the pneumocoques . 
at an international conference to which our association has participated , specialists have not really been satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination . 
this is not ideal . 
on the other hand , we are pleased to be able to impose at least this . 
i think it is a direction that we now need to follow said kalovsk√Ω . 
but the ministry of health does not want to change the process of vaccination against the pneumocoques . 
we are definitely not for the moment , said its spokesman vlastimil sr≈°e≈à . 
the voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks , say doctors . 
hana cabrnochov√° , president of the society specialising paediatricians , acknowledges that a vaccine based on the volontariata its shortcomings . 
if all the children were vaccinated , you could consider a reduction in renewals of vaccinations " in the situation where the vaccine is such a sum i understand the decision making voluntary vaccination , " said however cabrnochov√° . 
experts estimate that as of next year , more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their babies . 
vaccination against the pneumocoques marks a break as the fact that this is the first vaccination of children , which is funded by the insurance and not the state . 
cabrnochov√° explains that insurance companies should free up funds for prevention , and they would save on any further medical care . 
the doctors will have to buy their products themselves 
this is , however , linked to the concerns of paediatricians practitioners , relating to the purchase of vaccines . 
the original intent was to buy the vaccines by insurance companies , doctors , the receiving the same way that the other products of vaccine provided by the state . 
some members feared , however , that this would allow insurance " deduct the sums of health insurance . " 
thus , the doctors will have to buy the products and wait for the insurance repay them . 
according to the estimates , the paediatricians individually will invest nearly 40 000 kroner per month in vaccines , which is a big sum . 
it will be far from easy , according to cabrnochov√° . 
the son of an american artist involved in a " theft of museum " 
the son of frank frazetta , artist acknowledged , has been accused of trying to steal the paintings for a value of $ 20 million ( 12 million ) in the museum of her father . 
in pennsylvania , the police said that alfonso frank frazetta had been questioned while it mandated 90 paintings in his vehicle and in a trailer . 
in it , mr frazetta and another man have used a mechanical shovel to force the entry of the museum , in the region of pocono mountains . 
mr frazetta senior , aged 81 years old , is famous for his drawings of figures such as conan the barbaric and tarzan . 
at the time of the incident , the artist was in florida , reported the associated press news agency ( pa ) . 
pa quoted an official from the police that the young mr frazetta may have been motivated by a family feud . 
according to a statement from police , said mr frazetta jr . , 52 years , claims to have been allowed by his father " enter the museum , by whatever means , to transport the tables in a storage facility , " reported the agency . 
mr frazetta senior denies give such authorisation , said the agency . 
labour is defending the tax increase budget . 
the ministers have defended the increase of the tax and spending reductions announced in the report of pr√©-budget , despite the criticism from the opposition , companies and unions . 
the tories have said that alistair darling " has missed " an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing its decisions until after the elections . 
the chancellor has also drawn the ire in tackling low wages and salaries means . 
among its main proposals , we can see an increase of 0.5 % of the social insurance and a maximum rate of 1 % on the public wages from 2011 . 
the anger of the social insurance 
the unions have protested that the low wages are penalised by a recession that they are not responsible and warned that " problems " appeared to be . 
the reduction of insurance sociale- who will get about ¬£ 3 billion a year - has put the business world angry , because according to him , it is a tax on jobs while the goal should be a recovery of the economy . 
the increase , reserved for those who earn more than 20,000 gbp per year , will affect approximately 10 million workers . 
main points of the report of pre-budget 
the social insurance will increase still 0,5 % from april 2011 
the economy will shrink encoreplus that the 4,75 % expected this year 
new 50 % tax on bonuses bankers 
the increase of the tax on the profits of the society for small companies has been abandoned 
tax rebate electric cars and wind turbines 
increase pensions 2,5 % 
according to the estimates of the treasury , one winner 30,000 gbp will lose 90 gbp per year and one winner 40,000 gbp will lose 190 gbp , while a person winner 10,000 gbp per year will gain 110 gbp more . 
the ministers have said that their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 elicited " difficult decisions " but insisted that 60 % of the burden more taxes would have an impact on the first 5 % of employees . 
stephen timms , the treasury secretary , has refuted a tax increase , and pointed out that a reduction in spending was a " drop in the ocean " compared to what was needed . 
" these figures are important . they will enable us to halving the deficit , which is absolutely essential over the next four years , " he told the bbc . 
mr timms said he was confident and that the growth of the economy red√©marrerait at the end of the year . 
however , the forecasts of labour on economic growth - which will affect the amount it will have to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - have been put in doubt after the chancellor has been forced to revise its initial figures . 
in his speech , he said that the economy would fall probably 4,75 % this year - far worse than the decline of 3,5 % predicted in april - while the loan would be 3 billion gdp higher than the prior estimate . 
" missed opportunity " " 
the conservatives who will launch this thursday a new advertising campaign warning against the " debt crisis " of labour , have said that the project to borrow ¬£ 789 billion over the next six years was not viable . 
the ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to pay off , they added , dodged " cynically " difficult choices until after the elections - which must be held in june 2010 . 
" they have not presented meaningful on what they were going to do , " said philip hammond , chief secretary to the treasury in the shadow cabinet . " they had the opportunity to do so , and they have missed " . 
" the major announcements will be made after the elections , regardless of the victor " 
roger bootle , deloitte 
the labour party insists that schools , hospitals and the police will be protected the coming cuts , unlike the tory 's proposals which would lead to a more rapid and more important to the deficit . 
but the lib dems have said that the money raised through increased taxes and spending cuts would be used to support the spending next year , and not to reduce the deficit , arguing that the plans were " built on the wind . " 
nick robinson , political editor of the bbc , said that the timetable of the announcements - such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits in april , mentioned ci-dessus- leaves the chancellor in the face of accusations of propaganda , just because the money is recovered the following year . 
however , lelabour insists that additional aid is provided so that people are most in need and that the situation will be reviewed in september 2010 . 
" false budget " 
although the ministers have not published the details of spending beyond 2011 , economists have said that it was clear that the restrictions of public spending is starting to be felt in the medium term . 
the highly respected institute for fiscal studies ( institute of fiscal survey ) said that the figures of chancellor involve , in the future , substantial reductions in many areas , including potentially transport , higher education , science and defence . 
" the pain is in fact that delayed , " said its director , robert chote . 
" the most important announcements will be made after the election , whoever wins the election , " added roger bootle , economic adviser to deloitte 's accounting . 
" this has been a false report of pr√©-budget . markets caught well . " 
the fbi investigation into the " arrests of americans in pakistan " 
the fbi investigation into the arrest , pakistan , five reporters americans , who are suspected of links to extremists . 
the men have been arrested during a raid on a house in sarghoda in the eastern province of punjab , has announced the us embassy in pakistan , the bbc . 
the fbi said it dark to know if this was the same men who had been declared missing from their home in the us state of virginia , last month . 
the foreign ministry has said that he also sought information on these people . 
three of them are presented as being of pakistani descent , a legacy of egypt and the other of yemeni origin . 
if these are american citizens , of course , we would like to know what are the accusations against them and under what conditions they are detained , " said leporte-parole , ian kelly . 
katherine schweit , spokesman for the fbi said that the agency had been informed of the arrests and that she was in contact with the families of the missing students . 
" we are working with the pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there , and if this really are the students who are missing , " she said . 
the pakistani embassy in washington said that the men had been arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them . 
it said that the house was already monitored by local police and that no charges had yet been made against the men arrested . 
secretary of state , hillary clinton has refused any comment on the arrests , reported news agency reuters , but she said that the us should " greater cooperation with afghanistan and pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism which continues to recruit and train people . " 
the five students had been missing from their home by their families , in northern virginia , the end of november . 
amnesty condemns the " abuse " iranians 
in the last twenty years , human rights have been less respected than ever , according to the report by the association amnesty international . 
the report presents " repetitions of violations " by the regime , before and after the campaign of presidential elections in june . 
a man cited in the report has stated that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes . another said that he had been threatened with rape . 
iran has denied the previous criticism of its human rights . 
the authorities have said that such criticism are politically motivated . 
thousands of people have been arrested and dozens have been killed in iran after the disputed election of president mahmoud ahmadinejad has led to the largest public protests since the 1979 islamic revolution . 
dozens have been sentenced to prison sentences and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death . 
jon leyne , bbc correspondent in tehran , now in london , says that at the beginning of the protests , the supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , has acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse , ordering the closure of the detention centre of kahrizak . 
but since then , the authorities have not tolerated any criticism , says our correspondent . 
" false confession " 
amnesty international reported the case of a student in computer science of 26 years , ebrahim mehtari , who claimed to have been accused of " working with the networks of facebook " and to have protested against the election results . 
" they have often struck in the face , " he has been mentioned . 
" i have been burned with cigarettes , under the eyes , on the neck , head ... they have threatened to execute and humiliated me . " 
after five days , it has signed a false confession and he was released and left in the street , still in blood and half aware , said amnesty . 
in august , the losing candidate in the elections , mehdi karroubi , said that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others have been violated . 
the iranian authorities have denied the accusations of rape , but admitted that the abuse had taken place . 
amnesty has also cited the case of a former detainee who said have been locked in a container with 75 other people , for more than eight weeks , in a detention centre to kahrizak . 
amnesty has accepted that the iranian parliament and the judiciary create a committee to investigate on post-election unrest and the response of the government , but she said that the mandate and the powers of these bodies were not clear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public . 
the group said that at least 90 people had been arrested during the last three weeks , with the aim of preventing other demonstrations . 
ski runs built in the park in the city 
more than 100 tonnes of artificial snow has been used to transform the site of bristol in a track for competitions . 
the √©v√©nementpiste in the park ( a trail in the park ) has drawn 16 skiers snowborders semi-professionals and competing for the prize in species . 
at the top of the trail of any case not very stable park hill , a small springboard preceded a trail of 300 feet long . 
john hickman , a student in fourth year of medicine , said that the view from the top of the track was magnificent but that it was quite intimidating . 
it is a beautiful view , with all the lights of the city scintillant below . 
here are some of the best skiers and snowborders of the country - real talent , " he added . 
prices have rewarded the best voltiges - or figures carried out on the runway . 
after the festival on thursday night , the snow will be abandoned to melting .

islam can be french ? 
pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state . 
roger bootle , deloitte 
some readers will be lured by this new book , admirers of the last book of the author , " why the french do not like the headscarf " ( 2006 ) , a study elegant and well documented on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for 15 years and whose effects are still being felt today . 
the last book of mr bowen presents a much broader tapestry and more ambitious . 
good anthropologist , it not only wishes to know what politicians and the media say about islam in france , but what is happening in the country . 
he spent many months in mosques , schools and the institutes that provide now in france this quem . bozen calls " muslim areas " for the 5m-6m muslims . 
he knows very well listen and replicate the debates between teachers and pupils on the issues that concern them most . 
a muslim must marry in a mosque or to the town hall ( or both ) ? 
the evolution and the rights of homosexuals should be taught to young muslims ? 
a muslim woman can marry a non-muslim ? 
a muslim can use a banking system based on the interests for a loan ? 
these are practical problems , he says , which is the daily lot , rather than the political dramas that are of concern to the media . 
the author identifies a new generation of imams , teachers and intellectuals , all unknown to the general public , except perhaps tariq ramadan , an arab muslim born in switzerland . 
this new generation tries to open the debate on how to be both a good muslim and a good citizen in a secular society modern . 
they do not push the debate until the end . 
lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a french islam or european . 
intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by mr bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyers of a sunni islam purist associated with saudi arabia which of our days , are a small part of muslims in europe . 
mr bowen believes that the values of muslims and secularism of french could be compatible . 
but a compromise can be reached with the efforts of each camp . 
he wondered how the french politicians ( and the intellectual elite guardian if virulent of secularism ) are really committed to pluralism . 
according to him , muslims have not been spoiled , compared to catholics , protestants and jews who have also had to compromise with the historical secular republicanism . 
rather than a growing pragmatism , it detects a " narrowness key values . " 
islam can be french ? after reading this book , one is tempted to say " yes , but not yet . " 
the view the darkest of the world 
the arctic changes more quickly and more dramatic than any other place on the planet . 
the ice that made up is melting at an alarming rate , carrying with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere . 
oil , gas , shipments and fisheries sail in new waters open , with diplomats , lawyers and now writers in their wake . 
in " on a thin layer of ice , " richard ellis , a writer and artist , painted a natural history of the symbol of the north , the polar bear . 
connoisseurs of history and the complicated policies of the whaling , he described the long tradition of arctic explorers who were doing their evidence by chasing the bear white . 
the meeting of admiral nelson , then courageous aspiring 14 who had to fight the tip of its musket-shape , is certainly a myth , but the rest is true . 
the young cubs , captured when they swim with their mother , just killed , were caught and sent in zoos and circuses . 
at the beginning of the 20th century , a famous collected 75 bears at the same time . 
even today , the dimensions of a zoo are still generally a millionth of the surface necessary for an adult in freedom , and the climate is rarely said : a polar bear living in singapore has become because algae growing in its thick fur . 
click here for more information . 
mr ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and is often on the threat that constitute the hunters on the survival of the species . 
although banned in norway , in america and russia , the killings continue in greenland and canada , where hunters by helicopter and the inuits in motoski use powerful fusilsd' assault to oust their game . 
ironically , it is in the waters the most north of these two nations of the hunt that the ice will remain the longer . 
in his new book , " after the ice , " alun anderson , a former editor of new scientist , offers a clear summary and frightening of science of the arctic and a thrilling glimpse of what may be the future there . 
not that the scientists have all the answers . 
neither the atmosph√©ristes nor the oceanographers cannot accurately describe the speed of change . 
this is not for lack of trying . 
end nineteenth and early twentieth , travel pioneers of fridtjof nansen gave the first information on the melting of the ice sheet . 
the submarines of the cold war were then mapped the changes of relief sous-celle-ci . 
the satellite surveillance and the probes placed on the icebergs are of great help , but the bulk of the work is done by men hardened , camping in the cold . 
mr anderson contemplates the world of the extraordinary and tiny system dependent on the arctic ice , formed by the nets of brackish water hurry in freezing . 
but of the bear mentioned above the microscopic marvels contained in the ice , everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice , planned between 2013 and 2050 . 
" in a few months , this may be our turn " 
the marines , one of the 6 million people who have tabled kronor on the graves to arlington

in a few months , where we will be sent , we are likely to be in their place , said robinson on the subject of fallen soldiers . 
if this was happening to me , i would like someone to do the same for me , that is why i am trying just to show respect . 
it was one of the 6 000 volunteers to be gathered saturday morning to submit kronor on the graves of veterans , in various sections of the cemetery arlington ceremony . 
in 1992 , morrill worcester , owner of worcester wreath company to harrington , maine , has launched the commemoration and others have decided to decorate hundreds of graves in the cemetery arlington ceremony . 
now , to continue a tradition of 18 years , morrill and his wife karen , are each year the journey , stopping in various cities on their way to organise commemorations in honour of the military and the victims of terrorism . 
the worcester have also founded a non-profit organization , wreaths across america ( kroner across america ) , which aims to promote the event in all other states . 
this year , the volunteers have placed more than 16 000 kronor on the graves of arlington cemetery , around the pentagon , on the graves of the cemetery fayetteville enarkansas national cemetery , in the park come to new york city and on the site of the memorial for the victims of flight 93 of united airlines to shanksville , pennsylvania . 
for the second consecutive year , the foundation walmart foundation has given more than $ 150 000 to buy and carry the kronor . 
charleen hunt , 70 years ago , of westminster , has said that it had made the trip to arlington in honour of her husband , a career military died . 
although her husband is not buried in arlington , hunt said that for her , this gesture was a way to thank those who had sacrificed . 
it is a small gesture that can do the civilians to support our troops , she said . 
it is like visiting a grave family . 
emmitoufl√©e in several layers of warm clothing , the volunteers have market between lawns and hills stretches of the cemetery . 
the volunteers have chosen the graves of old , dating back to the first and second world war , as well as the vietnam war , because they are not as often visited that new graves , said the organisers . 
the mood was optimism , while children were playing and couples were held by the hand , carrying the pine garlands expenses on the grey graves . 
each round crown had a dark green color , with a small red bow tie on the top . 
nearby , hung over the silence on the section 60 , where most veterans of the wars in iraq and afghanistan are inhum√©s . 
the united service organizations gave 1 , 000 kroner to decorate the section but the bleak mood of the current wars filled the area . 
individuals pleuraient without hide , others prayed and families and friends conspired in the air cold . 
some read aloud the names carved in stone while others who dealt to see small information cards black and white , got itself into the earth humid for those whose grave had not yet been completed . 
sandra lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears on the grave of his son . 
it is part of zanesfield , ohio and had led eight hours to come and collect on the grave of marine sergeant gunnerydavid shane spicer , death in battle in july . 
no one should ever forget thanks to what we are free ... my son has paid for that , she said . 
" long after i am gone , i want someone remembered . " 
a us citizen arrested by the cuban authorities 
the cuban government has arrested a us citizen who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country , have said the services of the ministry of foreign affairs american . 
the person , who has not yet been identified , working for alternative development inc . , based in bethesda . 
the company is working on projects for clients such as the u.s. agency for international development and the world bank . 
the consular authorities as well as the u.s. interest section in havana are trying to have access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 december . 
the precise accusations have not been made public , although under the cuban law , a cuban citizen or a visitor can be arrested under the pretext of being " dangerous . " 
all the revolutionary activities , including protests moderate and writings criticism , lead the risk of arrest . 
the graffiti anti-gouvernementaux and speeches are regarded as serious crimes . 
cuba has a community of bloggers , conducted by yoani s√°nchez , popular commentatrice who writes frequently on the way are husband and she is followed and harassed by agents of the government . 
s√°nchez has made several requests to leave the country to go receive rewards but the authorisations have always been refused . 
the detention of a us citizen may increase the tension between the communist government of brothers in cuba and the obama administration is pursuing a " soft " approach in order to improve relations with the island . 
the announcement of the arrest was first reported by the new york times , on friday night . 
the new american policy insists that the cuban government advance by concrete steps , such as release political prisoners and create more space for the opposition , so that the us can reciprocate . 
mobile phones and laptops are allowed to cuba , although this is consumer goods new and wanted in a country or the average wage of an official is $ 15 per month . 
only this year , the cuban government has granted the ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones ; they are mainly used for text messages or for a conversation of 15 minutes that corresponds to a day 's pay . 
on the island , the use of the internet is extremely limited . 
it is available in the luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country , as well as in some buildings of the government , such as universities . 
cubans who want to connect often must communicate their name to the government . 
access to many web sites is restricted . 
the detention of an american in cuba is rare . 
most of the few americans incarcerated in cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking , says gloria berbena , press officer at the u.s. interests section in havana . 
berbena said she could not provide more information on the arrest . 
the arrest and detention are a big mistake . 
an activity that , in any other open society , would be allowed -- providing free mobile phones -- is a crime in cuba , said jose miguel vivanco , director of the americas programme of the group human rights watch , which has recently published a report on the severe freedoms in cuba , called " new castro , even cuba , " referring to the installation of raul castro as leader of the country to replace fidel , his older brother ill . 
according to vivanco , a defendant is often arrested , happened in judgment and imprisoned on the same day . 
he said that any solution would probably be policy and that the cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the united states , at a time when the two countries are beginning to get a better dialogue . 
the pakistani authorities to prevent a plot to send men in afghanistan 
on saturday , the pakistani authorities have spotted an organisation supposed to prepare a plot to send five men of northern virginia in afghanistan in order to kill american troops , saying that they hoped that this case would dismantle a significant network of terrorist recruiters of plundering the internet in search of young men radicalized . 
investigators have said that they have always fished for a living insurgente personality hidden , known as saifullah who invited these men in pakistan after having discovered when one of them has made comments approving the waves terrorists on the site of youtube video on the internet . 
arrived in pakistan , these men have been guided by saifullah who tried to help them to join the remote region of the tribal belt of pakistan , home of al qaeda and its terrorist training camps . 
but a representative of the pakistani secret services which has been informed of the matter said on saturday that saifullah had failed to convince the al-qaeda commanders that these men were not involved in the plot of the cia to infiltrate the terrorist network . 
because of this , they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of sargodha , far from the mountains northeast banned become a refuge of terrorism . 
they have been regarded as agents infiltrated . 
that is why they have been rejected , said a representative of the authorities who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case . 
the representative of the authorities said that the men were determined , and that they are still trying to get the permits needed to obtain the entry in the camps of al-qaeda when they were arrested by the forces of pakistani law . 
the case of these five men -- who remain in pakistan and who are interviewed by the fbi -- insist on the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more important , in the determination of people in whom trust . 
since the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , the us secret service have had for priority to infiltrate men in the network al-qaida . 
the recruiters the organisation play the role of gardes-barri√®res , refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who can prove to be spies . 
according to analysts , the potential american recruits are studied closely by al-qaida . 
but they are also very attractive for the group because of their potential access to american targets and their value propagandaire . 
however evan kohlmann , an expert on the foundation nefa based in the united states , said that the terrorist groups must also do more and more attention , in recent years in the choice of people they accept , because the american secret services have become experts in regard to their recruitment methods . 
if you try to infiltrate someone in these groups , what better way than to follow its model of recruitment that so many other people have already followed ? said kohlmann . 
the model is the one that is increasingly on the internet . 
tens of thousands of protestants in copenhagen are calling a " action " for the climate 
tens of thousands of protestants have market in the streets here saturday , calling for more extensive action on the climate of the part of the negotiators working in the palace of congress bella convention center of the city . 
the number of protesters was estimated at 100 000 people , but 25 000 according to estimates by the police . 
this event occurred relatively peacefully , although a small number of activists masked has lit a few explosives nearly a whole government buildings , centre- city . 
on a day when little thing happened during discussions on the climate sponsored by the united nations , thousands of activists marched through the city , deploying banners in english saying " there is no planet b " and a in spanish , saying " the earth said that it has enough . " 
several celebrities have joined the protests , including the top model and photographer danish , helena christensen , who said that travel to the home of his mother , peru , he has opened the eyes on the wrenching problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change is happening already . " 
this is one of the reasons why i decided to join the great works -- to get the word and appeal to the leaders of the world for that they make the right decisions , ambitious and committed , she said . 
this is not an easy task , but it must be company , it is no longer possible to avoid it . 
the police prevented the protesters to come too close to the bella centre and said that it had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they wore a mask or that they were in possession of knives . 
the police prevented the protesters to come too close to the bella centre and said that it had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they wore a mask or that they were in possession of knives . 
according to a passing who asked to remain anonymous because of its involvement in the discussions on the climate , the activists who wore masks and black clothes , lit several explosives near the main channel in copenhagen which is surrounded by a few ministries . 
they fired close to the buildings , he said , adding that they were first rockets , followed later by " a few big explosions . " 
inside the palace of congress , the people gathered around television screens to follow the march , throughout the afternoon . 
but it seems that the protesters have not managed to wake up the consciousness of key authorities such as su wei , representative of china for the climate . 
when asked whether he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations , he replied in english , " in fact , it is something that i had not conscience . 
he then continued in mandarin , declaring " the event is important , i cannot hear what happens outside . " 
he has observed that the march could seem harmful or useful according to the prospects . 
it shows the interest of the public and of various sectors on the subject of climate change , he said . 
on the other hand , " you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or they are damaging to the freedom of others . " 
the results of the tests reveal the stubborn disparities between the races 
the federal report last week on the results in math has made a good news for the public schools in washington d.c. 
although the district is still far behind the head , the report shows that the grade 4 and grade 5 ( cm1-cm2 ) are much more major progress over the past two years that in cities such as atlanta , chicago and new york . 
but the latest figures from the national assessment of educational progress ( national assessment of progress of education ) is the persistent gap between the performance of african-americans and white people , both local and national . 
the results means of white kids of grade 4 ( fourth grade ) to washingtond.c. have risen over the last two years , 262 270 ( on a scale of 500 ) , but those of their classmates african-american , increased by just three points , 209 to 212 . 
the gap of success has actually increased between 2007 and 2009 , from 53 to 58 points . 
the progress of african-americans in grade 8 ( fourth ) generally remains constant , falling only to a point , 245 to 244 . 
the result means of whites has not been included in the results of the tests because the sample was not important enough . 
the overview of a period of six years is no more encouraging . 
in 2003 , the gap between blacks and whites in class of grade 4 ( fourth grade ) , when the first report naep district was published , was 60 points ( 262 to 202 ) . 
although the results achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period , the difference is only reduced to 58 points . 
last week , some defenders in the district have expressed concern that rising celebrated by the director of group of educational institutions michelle a. rhee and the mayor , adrian mr fenty ( democrat ) were powered by students whites who were already good elements . 
this would mean that we have the aggregate in considering the elements on the top of the scale , which is problematic and embarrassing , said jeff smith , director of d.c. voice , a nonprofit group that defends equality in education in the district . 
i do not jump for joy for one or two points earned , said kwame r. brown ( related democrat ) , a member of the council of d.c. and whose daughter is in grade 4 , eaton elementary ( elementary school ) . 
often critical of the management style of rhee , brown said that the message of the results of tests is that the middle schools ( colleges ) of the city desperately in need of attention . 
really , you always want to see the positive signs and i respect it . 
but what is fear is that we do not spend enough time and energy to our middle schools ( colleges ) . 
rhee said that the district should continue to find better ways to respond to the needs of the students in difficulty . 
this autumn , for example , some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading , the wilson reading system , aimed schoolchildren classes end of the round elementary and beginning of college which have not included the foundations of the reading earlier in the educational system and which are quite lag behind their peers . 
every day , the programme of mathematics for the classes of kindergarten ( kindergarten ) to grade 6 ( sixth ) puts the emphasis on the games and the experiences of real life , as they have been put in place in the district by the former responsible clifford janey , which must also be credited for the progress of naep reported last week . 
i simply believe that we must continue to work to provide better interventions in these pupils of lower level than the class , said rhee . 
others believe that the results of the naep raise the question of whether rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing the money and resources for the schools with less good results in order to reduce the gap . 
it is a dilemma for michelle rhee , said bruce fuller , a trainer of education at the university of berkeley in california which examines the results of the tests of cities . 
the conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to the schools in the poorest neighborhoods of washington . 
also this targeting can have repercussions policies which hinder this important programme . 
but the problem , of course , is that as the other superintendant schools , it is trying to use the middle class of whites and blacks . 
we focus to ensure the development of a system of good schools . 
we need to strengthen our schools districts so that all the families regardless of where they are from , be assured that their children will be able to obtain an excellent public education . 
janey , now superintendant schools in newark , said in an interview this week that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap of success was the duration of the traditional public school , today to 180 days in the district of washington , to be in competition with the charter schools . 
we must get about 200 days to have the strength to change , said janey , which came to an agreement with the union of its teachers last year to obtain 185 days , which it considers a " starting point " to achieve an increase in the next contract . 
make higher education a promise of future 
the bus stopped in gettysburg college with a long whistling . 
graciela rodriguez , 12 years ago , in down , and a moment of eyes blink at the sight of the white columns , facades of bricks and leafy lawns . 
the parents of graciela had only been able to finish high school , √†el el salvador . 
until recently , graciela itself , which is born in silver spring and lives in riverdale , had never set foot on a university campus . 
also , when she and other students in grade 8 ( fourth ) of the group have explored gettysburg where school fees are $ 38 690 per year , his attitude was less a new student impressed that enthusiastic . 
super this is where i am going to study ! has think graciela who would like to study medicine , although the guide the ran towards the entrance to the building of science . 
yippee really ? she said songeuse , when he told the low ratio law professor - student . 
the university of pennsylvania was the seventh that were visiting children during their journey of discovery of three days and now , they had completely integrated the message : the question is not whether you go to the university : 
the question is where . 
although this question is still largely for the large number of american children born to parents hispanic immigrants who have left the high school where became parents to adolescence , they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit of university education that will allow them to enter the middle class . 
in fact , a " hispanic " second generation " on cinqpoursuit its studies in high school -- a notable success , if we consider that both of their immigrant parents , most of mexico or central america , entered the us without having finished high school . 
their success is important , say researchers , they open the way to the next generations who will play an important role in the workforce of the country . 
researchers who study fighters claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed . 
many are also those whose parents set targets high to their children and are finding ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with the american schools . 
the programmes of mentorat also play a very important role to help graciela and millions of children as it to reach the university -- in particular , if its efforts are regular and long-term . 
when you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system , any intervention , at any time , does not help them , said patricia g√°ndara , researcher , university of california at davis who has studied the latin american students . 
we must think to offer a support network for those children from kindergarten to high school . 
the federal programme which has financed the visit of universities of graciela is a good example . 
known as gear up ( preparing you ) , it provides more than $ 300 million per year systems of local schools to organise programmes of preparation for the university that start when students of families on low incomes are in middle school ( college ) and continue until the end of years of high school . 
since 1999 , the programme has been followed by more than 10 million students , with more than 60 percent entering university , according to the department of education . 
the iraqi oil ministry gets agreements with foreign oil companies 10 
despite the concerns about violence and political instability , the iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auction that ended saturday . 
the 10 agreements reached by the iraqi oil ministry with the foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies from china , russia and europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the oil industry from iraq , invalidated by decades of war and sanctions . 
american companies are gone with participation in only two of the 10 fields auctioned . 
seven american companies had paid to participate in the second auction , which began friday . 
the only one that had put an auction has lost . 
two us companies have obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in june . 
the low representation of american oil giants in the opening up of the oil sector in iraq has surprised analysts . 
iraq has finally opened its doors , after six years of war , and instead of american companies , european and asian companies that open the way , said ruba husari , editor of the forum iraq oil forum , a site of information on the internet . 
it will take a long time before another offer is being made in iraq . 
the concerns about security , corroborated by massive coordinated bombings , tuesday , and political instability while the us military troops withdraw have slowed down the american oil companies , which prevented them from entering with more force in iraq , which has the third largest oil reserve in bully of the world , say analysts . 
the american companies were , in some cases , at a disadvantage because of their rivals , in particular the chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government , including the cost of labor were significantly lower , and who were more prepared to take risks because they did not have to be accountable to shareholders . 
exxon-mobil and occidental petroleum inc . , have been the only american companies to obtain contracts with the ministry . 
the most important american companies , such as chevron and conocophillips , which had strong links with the iraqi oil ministry and brought their technical advice , are gone empty-handed . 
the russian company lukoil and gazprom were the two main shareholders in two contracts awarded this weekend . 
the chinese national petroleum corp. being . , owned by the state , has more ench√©ri on contracts that other companies and is left with significant holdings in contracts for two main fields . 
we all know that china is becoming a major economy , as well as a technological power , said assam jihad , spokesman of the ministry of oil . 
we are confident that the chinese company will be equal with its competitors and realise its commitments in iraq . 
the companies pr√©-s√©lectionn√©es to submit auctions have made offers which have subsequently been compared to the price per barrel that the ministry agreed to pay to motivate the production above current levels for each field . 
one of the main organisers of al qaeda would have been killed in pakistan 
it seems that a us missile , having struck along the border with afghanistan has killed one of the organisers of the operations of al-qaida , this week , said friday the american authorities of counter-intelligence . 
if the information is confirmed , it would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leaders this autumn . 
saleh al-somali was one of the two arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car , on tuesday , near the town of miran shah , in the province of north waziristan , according to american sources and pakistani authorities in the region . 
local authorities have said that the missiles had been fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the cia , inside the lawless tribal border of pakistan . 
they drove a white car , heading towards the afghan border , when the car was struck , said a member of the secret service pakistani civilians , speaking on the phone to miran shah . 
the representatives of the authority said that the local activists suspects fled into place and have quickly confiscated what was left of the " body totally blown apart . " 
it was completely impossible to local authorities to check the identity of the victims , but the two representatives anti-terror americans have given unspecified evidence that somali was part of the dead . 
somali was described as one of the military responsible organizers al-qaeda terrorist operations who ran the group outside of the afghanistan-pakistan region . 
his role was to hold of plots in the world , said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous , citing the sensitive nature of the air strikes inside pakistani territory . 
given its central role , this included probably conspiracies of attacks against the united states and europe . 
it followed the strategic direction of the leaders of al-qaeda and has translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks . 
a second representative of the american authority said that somali had progressed rapidly in the ranks of al-qaida' s and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region . 
it is perhaps not known of the great american public , but this does not diminish the threat that it is for us and our allies , said the second official representative . 
if his death is confirmed , somali would be the second character important to al-qaeda or the second taliban leader killed since september , when a similar attack killed najmuddin jalolov , leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt , as well as three other operators . 
the pace of attacks carried out by cia drones has decreased since the summer , around six operations per month to two , according to the figures by the long war journal , a website tempered by a nonprofit group . 
this decline is perhaps due to improved tactics of terrorist groups who have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while killing also ruthlessly suspected informants , says the site . 
the un special envoy to kabul to cut 
un special envoy for afghanistan , kai eide , said friday that he would resign from his post in march , at the end of a tumultuous mandate tainted by allegations of corruption extended during the presidential elections , supported by the un . 
the departure of eide comes at a time when the obama administration has decided to send 30 thousand additional troops in afghanistan . 
the un envoy , said he supported this increase , but it has expressed its concern about the timing of the united states for a withdrawal of troops that would start in 18 months and which would oblige other governments of nato to withdraw their forces . 
we need to accelerate the development of our security forces in afghanistan , send the right signal to the afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community , said eide in a telephone interview from kabul . 
our commitment must be in the long term . 
the norwegian diplomat has also urged the united states and other powers military to increase the number of international officials helping the political transition in afghanistan . 
the increase military must be copied by civilians , he said . 
eide said he did not resign but that it would simply the commitment that he had made to his family , in march , not to spend two years in kabul . 
he said that he wanted to prevent the united nations . 
secretary-general ban ki-moon now knows that he has the time to find a replacement . 
i simply said that it was better to start looking at my replacing , said eide . 
when i came here , there was a gap of two months between the start of my predecessor and my arrival . 
according to the representatives of the un , ban has already started looking for a replacement . 
the representatives argue that the name of staffan di mistura has been quoted ; it is a italian-swiss citizen who has recently chaired a un mission in baghdad and jean-marie gu√©henno , a frenchman who has previously led peacekeeping operations of the un . 
the reputation of eide in afghanistan has been put to the test after his former deputy , peter w. galbraith , accused , in september , to promote president hamid karzai during the presidential election and hide the evidence of massive electoral fraud . 
eide denied these allegations , but he said that the accusations of galbraith -- which has been thanked -- " have damaged the mission because there was already a healthy dose of skepticism regarding the international observation elections . " 
eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate rescue of us forces in afghanistan . 
it has also urged the un officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the united states and other western countries that it is attributed to the mission in afghanistan , saying that would give them more confidence on how their money is spent . 
eide has expressed his frustration about the limits of its power in afghanistan , saying that the onerous regulations recruitment of the un vitiated its possibilities to bring new talent . 
the rules of the un are such that i have not been able to recruit a single person since may , he said . 
it is catastrophic and it cannot continue . 
gates : iran must undergo additional sanctions 
the defense secretary , robert mr gates said on friday that the major world powers would soon impose " important " additional sanctions on iran because of its inability to engage in talks on the nuclear ambitions . 
gates , speaking before the assembled 300 american soldiers in the north of iraq , during a visit of a week in the war zones in afghanistan and iraq , has d√©dramatis√© the possibility of military action against the islamic republic . 
there is no good option in iran , he said , in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such an outcome ¬® . 
one of the things that i weighs the most , is that if i have learned one thing in iraq over the past six years , this is the side unpredictable inherent to the war . 
the obama administration considers a set of sanctions , which target the military and political elite of iran , but gates has pointed out that some of these sanctions could also affect the iranians from the street . 
he said that a " whole of incentives and punishments " might be necessary in order to persuade the iranian government that it would actually less good security with nuclear weapons " because " its people would suffer √©norm√©ment' of these sanctions . 
on friday , in a statement from the spokesman for the white house , robert gibbs , the administration has joined the european leaders in a warning that iran will face probable " consequences " if it does not reduce its nuclear programme in full compliance with the un security council and its supervisory body , the international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) . 
iran continues to say that he wants to develop its nuclear experience only for peaceful purposes . 
in the talks in geneva on 1 october , it has indicated that it would take the dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of its storage of enriched uranium , in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor . 
the administration has prompted such an agreement , means to develop a confidence on both sides and buy time for negotiations . 
since then , iran appears to be removed from the attempts of agreement - in part , say the experts , because the iranian leadership is divided on the fact to engage with the united states . 
frankly , in my opinion , the hardening of iran facing some of the proposals of the international community for which they had in fact given their agreement at the beginning of october , has led the international community , including the russians and the chinese , to join what they had not envisaged , in terms of important additional sanctions against the iranians , said gates . 
president obama has set the 31 december as the deadline for iran to respond to the proposals , before it turns to other options , including the pursuit of what the secretary of state hillary rodham clinton has once called " increased sanctions . " 
in a statement made on thursday in new york , the mission of iran to the united nations has condemned what it called " allegations without foundation " of some members of the security council on iran 's nuclear activities and said that it was okay to continue talks with the united states and five other major world powers , " in order to achieve a satisfactory solution in the long term . " 
gates , who had to return to washington late on friday , has met the morning , the iraqi prime minister , nouri al-maliki , before flying to the rich oil region of kurdish so derencontrer those responsible for the troops to kirkuk , kurdish and irbil . 
tensions persist between the kurds and the arab majority in iraq , particularly on the borders , property rights and the share of income . 
gates has urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid all delays of american plans to reduce the number of american troops , 115 000 to 50 000 before the end of august . 
gates also want to calm anxiety of kurds regarding the withdrawal outstanding . the american authorities have quoted gates saying to massoud barzani , president of the regional government of kurdistan : " we will protect your security , your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified iraq . " 
we do not abandon you . " 
in china , a change of direction ageing 
wang weijia and her husband have grown up surrounded by propaganda poster the preaching , " the mother earth is too tired to accommodate more children " and " a baby and more , it is a grave more . " 
they have so far learned the lesson that the authorities of the government of shanghai , raised by the inadequate birth rate of their city and by the ageing of the population , have radically changed direction this summer and have begun to encourage young couples to have more of a child ; their response has been instantaneous and firm : never . 
we have already given our time and our energy to a single child . 
there is no second , said wang , 31 years , director of human resources and who has a son of 8 months . 
more than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in china , creating two generations of children unique notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled , nicknamed the " little emperors , " a crisis of the population is threatening the country . 
according to the un , the average birth rate fell from 1,8 children per couple compared to six when the policy has been implemented . 
the distribution of the population , while it is expected that the number of residents of 60 years and more bursts , 16,7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31,1 percent in 2050 . this figure is well above the global average of about 20 percent . 
this imbalance is even worse in the coastal cities rich with a highly educated population , such as shanghai . 
last year , the people of 60 and over accounted for 22 percent of the population of residents registered in shanghai , while the birth rate was less of a child per couple . 
xie lingli , director of the shanghai municipal councillor population and family planning commission ( commission of the shanghai municipal population and family planning ) said that the fertile couples should have babies to " help to reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a labor shortage in the future . " 
shanghai is on the point of becoming " as old - but not as rich , however - that the developed countries such as japan and sweden , " she said . 
a gradual mitigation 
written in the constitution of the country in 1978 , the one-child policy is to this day , without doubt , the most controversial requirement introduced by the communist government . 
couples who transgress this policy may have to pay huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and a discrimination in the workplace . 
the chinese authorities have attributed to the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources , while the lawyers of human rights have denounced the abuse in the execution of this policy . 
in rural areas , some representatives of the authority have forced pregnant women to a second child to have abortions . 
in addition , many couples have resorted to selective abortions , leading to a ratio boys - girls abnormally high . 
in recent years , the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy . 
in 2004 , they have given more exceptions to the rule -- including for the residents of towns , members of ethnic minorities and cases in which the man and woman are already children unique -- and in 2007 , they have toned down many of their slogans hard . 
qiao xiaochun , a professor at the institute of population research ( research institute on the population ) , at the university of beijing , said that the authorities of the central government have recently discussed even more radical changes , such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is an only child . 
in july , shanghai has become the first chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage the births . 
in no time , the posters urging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of regulations detailing which has the right to have a second child and how to make the authorization request . 
the government of the city has sent responsible family planning and volunteers to meet couples , to their homes , and slip the prospectus under their door . 
he has also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child . 
according to the head of family planning , the answer has been disappointing . 
disappointing answer 
although the responsible in a rural town in the suburbs of shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples seeking a second child after the launch of the campaign , the more urban district reported that there was no change . 
the huinan common , with a population of 115 000 , for example , there is always that four to five requests per month . 
officials in shanghai , disappointed , say that despite the campaign , the number of births in the city , in 2010 , is still expected to be only about 165 000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008 . 
feng juying , head of the committee of family planning in the municipality of caolu of shanghai , said that the financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children . 
they want to cater to their first child , she said . 
yang jiawei , 27 years and his wife , liu juanjuan , 26 years ago , have said that they would dearly love to have two children , and that they are legally allowed . 
but as many chinese , they have only the minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government . 
without a social protection , they say , the decision would be irresponsible . 
the westerners wrongly that the one-child policy is a problem of rights , said yang , a structural engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant the first child of the couple . 
it is true , we fly the chance of having more than one child . 
but the problem is not just the law . 
this is money . 
other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation . 
wang , head of human resources , said that she wanted a single child because it was a itself . " we are the center of the family and had used that everyone takes care of us . " 
we have not used to take care of somebody else and we really do not want to take care of others . " 
chen zijian , 42 years and owner of a society of translation the said more bluntly . 
for couples working at two , middle class , which reduce the birth rate , he says , we must be selfish to succeed . 
the people of 20 or 30 years grew up seeing their parents fight in the first phase of the capitalist china and do not want to have themselves this style of life , he says . 
even one child asks a lot of time his parents , he says . 
a mother must abandon at least two years of his social life . 
then there are the problems of space -- " you must change your apartment " -- and planning -- " when your child has only 9 months , you need to write his cv for a place in the maternal better . " 
most of his friends are prepared to this experience once , said chen , but not two . 
our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living , he says . 
we do not want to be too much of a sacrifice . 
the un group plans to plans for reducing emissions 
the climate conference , sponsored by the un -- characterised so far by the appropriations d√©sorganis√©es and mutual recriminations -- is back in the spotlight friday , because of the publication of a document outlining the ambitious reductions of greenhouse gases in the next 40 years , with the industrialised nations supporting most of the burden in the next time . 
the text , which could provide the foundations for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases , has pointed out the remaining obstacles , as much as it has informed the path to take . 
but it has been seen as an important step forward in the negotiations who lack of time , with more than 100 leaders of the world arriving next week in copenhagen . 
drafted by a special working group of the un , the text does not say how many rich countries would give the poor to cope with climate change , and to the long term . 
and it offers a wide range of options for the key issues , including the way the developed economies and the emerging economies new could reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the rise in global temperature that those responsible would be prepared to tolerate . 
it gives a great flexibility in the process , said john coequyt , representative in washington of the sierra club . 
michael zammit cutajar , who has written six pages of the document , studied a text of negotiations 180 pages to focus on what has described the secretary-general executive on climate change to the un , yvo de boer , as the " full picture " . 
it shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations collectively would reduce their emissions in 2020 , from 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels , while the main developing countries , during the same period , would reduce emissions by 15 to 30 percent . 
together , the country would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050 . 
the european union has also relaunched negotiations , on friday , promising to provide $ 3.6 billion per year for the next three years to help the poorest countries to adapt to the impact of climate change -- to cope with floods and drought or to avoid deforestation . 
however , on friday , the same verbal altercations occurred , which have dominated the negotiations since last week . 
todd stern , the us representative to the climate-change negotiations has rejected any discussion obliging the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialised countries , in comparison to the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies , if they were not funded by the developed countries . 
this change is the signal that the obama administration is becoming more harsh towards china that the bush administration has been , there are two years ago . 
the us will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of the major developing countries , says stern which also lamented that the text is not enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers . 
stern has made his comments an hour after the chinese deputy minister of foreign affairs , he yafei has said that the principal negotiator american , or lacked " common sense " , was " extremely irresponsible " for having said earlier in the week that the us would not help financially china to combat global warming . 
with the future economic trajectories of major world powers at stake , defects appeared at the time in the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies . 
the current battle is more relevant to the rescue of individual economies that the rescue of the planet , with china and the us cheap party political show by arguing on their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen countries are the most influential ignorant of the scientific imperatives to act more boldly . 
ricardo ulate , a delegate from costa rica , said that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting for who should bear the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gases , even if the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the big emitters accountable for their actions . 
this is really a game in which has developed a new economic hegemony , said ulate , which is also advise on the climate for mexico and central america for conservation international . 
some of these countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to put pressure to obtain a treaty forcing legally , in copenhagen , although most of the main participants say that the negotiations will lead to a minimum , to a political agreement . 
the alliance of small island states which brings together 43 members , has drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages , early friday morning . 
artur runge-metzger , head of the unit climate of the european commission , said that the action of small island states has " put political pressure on the comprehensive political process , " in part by what they are now unified and they require to emerging economies such as china and india , to act . 
the debates have become a matter of urgency , so that the delegates focused on the fact that they must solve most of the problems pending before the heads of governments come to an agreement . 
high level officials such as the indian environment minister , jairam ramesh and the chinese deputy took their plane and ran in the building of the bella center to attend meetings in behind closed doors and to conferences of information , in order to make claims which will be considered during the following week . 
the real image of the rally -- during which 13 000 people come in and out of the palace of congress every day -- activists jamming players are nightly spectacles mocking countries which according to them , to reveal that the proposals are made and distributed on paper , rather than by email -- is a challenge . 
the intensity is growing : almost all of the ministers are here and not later than on wednesday , 60 heads of government will be in copenhagen . 
we are entering the court of large , said carlos manuel rodriguez , vice president for global politics of conservation international . 
lorries arrive . 
in britain , the first train to 225 km / h will redefine the syndrome monday 
has 5h13 , on monday morning , a whistle percera the night to signal the start of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in britain . 
the first commuter train at high speed of the country will reach 225 km / h , while it filera of ashford , in kent , to london st pancras , covering the 93 km in 38 minutes . 
lord adonis , the transport minister , will be joined by dame kelly holmes aboard the first commuter train javelin outside london . 
it hopes that the new service will allow britain to integrate an international network of fast trains and reliable and will link the large conurbations of the midlands , the north and scotland to london . 
the small holes lost will become suburban cities flourishing , periods of business travel will be much less long and the passage of the plane and the car to the train will reduce national emissions of carbon while reducing congestion on the roads . 
in theory , the three main political parties adhering to this project . 
but the ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network , the battle of inevitable planning and fears of dangers to the environment may curb high-speed lines in britain . 
according to the times , high speed two ( hs2 ) , a company created in january to achieve for the government , a feasibility report , will make his document to lord adonis on 30 december . 
this will allow him to get a detailed map the route of the next step planned for the high-speed network . 
the new line linking london to the west midlands will be established in the five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial . 
in the campaign , the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres final route . 
it is also planned that hs2 has three options for a high-speed network larger , go to the north . 
lord adonis will respond in the spring . 
the privileged options are outlined in a configuration in for which a high-speed line will go up to the west midlands . 
the line who in two at or near birmingham , with a branch towards the western pennines √†manchester and scotland and another moving into the northeast , towards sheffield , leeds and newcastle upon tyne . 
a single line will pass through scotland . 
" it seems that this will be the best option of performance' said a professional of the railways . 
when it is finished , the journey times between london and edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes . 
the first branch , which will not open until 2025 , will allow all passengers to travel between london and birmingham in 49 minutes , compared to a journey of an hour at the moment . 
the proposals will allow the train to travel to 400km / h , making the uk grid the fastest in the world . 
the initial route is designed to allow trains to 400m in length and can carry 1100 people . 
up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a line london - birmingham . 
a terminal that can accommodate 20 , 000 passengers per hour would be necessary . 
in data the constraints of space , it is expected that an existing station will be enlarged to receive the high-speed network . 
experts from the rail industry say that only st pancras international or euston offer this possibility . 
lord adonis announce whether or not he feels that the project must be put in place , but public consultations more protracted and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election . 
even if it launches the machine , the network will have to be built part by part . 
trains are first forced to roll out high-speed existing on the tracks north of birmingham , retaining journey times between london and scotland superior to three hours . 
this solution seems to be the best to secure a passage of aircraft trains , constituting a reference point for the revolution of the railways . 
taxpayers pay back the loan of 75.000 gbp for the orangerie of tory 
alan duncan , the chief tory member of parliament , has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year to repay the cost of a orangerie he has built into his house in his constituency . 
the head of the party which has been downgraded by david cameron to be complaining that the members of parliament were " maintained " , has increased its borrowing of 75.000 gbp to build an extension in oak to his second home , in rutland .

usa : polanski 's lawyer once again calls for the abandonment of prosecution 
the lawyer of filmmaker franco-polonais roman polanski has called for a new time thursday in los angeles ( california , west of the united states ) , the abandonment charges against his client , currently under house arrest in switzerland on a matter of mores of more than 30 years . 
hummel chad , the lawyer of the director of " the pianist , " has denounced before three judges of the court of appeal in the second district of california serious procedural errors at the time of the facts , in 1977 . 
i have been calling for the dropping of here and now , said mr hummel , before adding that the behaviour of the judge in charge of the case at the time , laurence rittenband , " was a spooky . " 
according to him , the judge rittenband -- died since -- would have discussed , before returning her sentence , with a prosecutor would have said that roman polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious fault of procedure . 
this discussion was revealed in the documentary " roman polanski : wanted and desired " ( roman polanski , sought and sought-after ) , from the same of the prosecutor , david wells . 
but mr wells had finally declared the end of september had " lied " to the author of the documentary . 
if the court refuses to abandon the prosecution , mr hummel has called for the holding of a trial , which would allow him to present the evidence of his arguments . 
the accusation , for its part , has reiterated the arguments already developed in the first instance , namely that no dropping of could be seriously studied as roman polanski did not intend to stand before the court . 
the filmmaker , aged 76 years old , had fled the us in 1978 , before the imposition of her sentence , for " illegal " sex with a minor for 13 years . 
it has never called the feet in the united states since . 
the deputy prosecutor in los angeles county , phyllis asayama , has said that roman polanski " must be there to present themselves to the audience . " 
in this case , do we want to send the message , not only to ( roman polanski ) but also to other defendants , that it is possible to escape ? , asked mrs asayama . 
for her , the filmmaker " calls a favour to the court , while contemptuous his authority . " 
one of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- pointed to him as " that there were other alternatives to the flight . " 
mr hummel was not the only one to ask the abandonment proceedings against roman polanski . 
the lawyer for the victim , samantha geimer , has also called for , once again , the end of the prosecution . 
pointing out that his client will no longer be harassed at every twist of the case polanski , she added : " nobody in this room cannot say that the process was fair . 
thirty-two years is enough . "

the new of johnny hallyday " are very positive , " has assured friday , his son david to his arrival at the airport in los angeles where he was to travel to his father 's bedside in hospital for several days . 
the new are very positive . 
it is very strong , it happens very well , said at the press david hallyday to its exit from the plane that the from paris shortly after local 13h00 ( 21 . 00 gmt ) . 
the son of the singer , the air relaxed , has assured us that he was going " very quickly " to the hospital cedars-sina√Ø of los angeles , where johnny hallyday was admitted on monday for an infection following the operation of a hernie discale november 26 in paris . 
the singer was " placed in an artificial coma that night in los angeles for a reason to comfort , to prevent suffering and able to administer his treatment , " said the press service . 
johnny hallyday had already been put in a drug-induced coma by doctors from the hospital cedars-sina√Ø of los angeles , where he was admitted on monday for an infection following the operation of a hernie discale november 26 in paris . 
the singer had to be r√©op√©r√© in the night from wednesday to thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this speech . 
his wife laeticia went friday morning at the french high school in los angeles where is scolaris√©e their daughter jade , to attend a performance at school , has seen a photographer for the agence . 
the head of orthopedic surgery and traumatologique of the hospital of the piti√©-salp√™tri√®re , yves caton√© , announced that he would visit on monday to los angeles with the singer . 
the producer has violently questioned dr st√©phane delajoux , the neurosurgeon which has operated the singer on 26 november to the clinic 's international mountain park in paris . 
we were told that it was a massacre . 
surgeons in los angeles have said that they were outraged , said mr camus . 
i heard about a possible judicial procedure to come , he said . 
jean-claude camus has estimated that johnny hallyday was " party far too fast for los angeles , with the permission of the parisian surgeon . " 
i had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and i was amazed , given that i myself had two hernies discales , he added . 
a little earlier on rtl , he had indicated that the singer was apparently " party without drain , nothing , " after his operation in paris . 
dr st√©phane delajoux is very experienced in the middle of art . 
he had made the actress marie trintignant in vilnius , a few days before his death , in a clinic of neuilly-sur-seine where he was at the time . 
in 2007 , it had also made the actress charlotte gainsbourg to reduce a h√©matome following a brain hemorrhage . 
but it is also a doctor to the reputation sulfureuse , repeatedly condemned by justice , in cases of medical liability , as well as for tax evasion and fraud . 
olivier metzner me , the lawyer of the order of doctors , has been accused of being " a man without scruples " continued " regularly " before the council of the next , and who is " far from being appropriate . " 
after several days of silence , dr. st√©phane delajoux spoke friday through his lawyer , david koubbi . 
it has indicated that the speech was " quite well " and that the tests post-op√©ratoires were " normal " . 
the operation " was not hemorrhagic and was therefore not the laying of a drain , " he added . 
in any event , the tour of the singer , whose troubles for health are multiplying since this summer , seems aside . 
obviously , a resumption of the tour on 8 january ( in amiens , ndlr ) as expected , it seems very short , said mr camus . 
the association udf tone and increase the amount the new centre not to use its acronym 
the association udf , controlled by the modem fran√ßois bayrou , responded friday to the takeover attempt of the president of the new centre , herv√© morin , the acronym of the ex-parti giscardien , putting it in remains not to use it on any support , under pain of prosecution . 
herv√© morin has publicly announced its intention to recover the acronym udf , ruling that fran√ßois bayrou does not deserve to defend his legacy policy after having reached out to the left . 
the defence minister , whose party is a partner of the ump , had also planned to confirm this strategy on saturday before the national council of the nc . 
to support its approach , it has received the support of the member herv√© de charette ( ex-ump happened in nc ) which claims ownership of the brand udf to have been the first to the table in 2004 at the national institute of industrial property . 
but on friday evening , the office of the association udf , controlled by the friends of fran√ßois bayrou who do not intend to let themselves be deprived , is out of his silence to launch a formal notice to the minister and member , summoning the no longer use the acronym and convey to them the property of the brand , under pain of prosecution . 
you have multiplied , these days , the statements indicating that you were going to offer your political movement of + resume + the acronym udf , writing the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau , including fran√ßois bayrou and marielle de sarnez the modem , as senator jean arthuis of the alliance centrist . 
you also believed to follow up on your militant material and on page of care of your site , the name of this movement , the + new centre + , the slogan + the udf today + , also see the signatories of the letter . 
as you know , you have no right to the use of this symbol , explains the office of the udf that remains the nc to withdraw " immediately the mention of the name of the udf all support as well as ( its ) website " . 
it also asks herv√© de charette " to convey the property of ( the ) marks to its rightful copyright holders . " 
if you were not , the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of adherents of the udf , prevent the signatories . 
in their letter they stipulate that the udf " is a fully-fledged political movement since 1978 " and recalling that mr morin and his friends had " made the choice " of leaving in 2007 " to create a movement competitor , as others had done in 2002 , to create the ump . " 
the new centre does so , according to them , no right to use the acronym udf ( union for french democracy ) . 
they also recall that the last congress of the udf voted in 2007 its accession to the modem for three years and the creation of an office responsible for defending " the material and moral interests " of the training founded by val√©ry giscard d 'estaing . 
as for herv√© de charette , pursues the office , " when it has tabled the brand , " he was " more adhering to the udf for three years , " but the ump . 
it benefits scandalously and fraudulently the abscence depositing the acronym for the udf carry out to his account . 
this inappropriate is turning into crime , d√©noncent-ils , before to mock , on the strategy of the nc : " it seems to us that in politics , as in life , it is more worthy to make a name for yourself to try to get out of the anonymity by taking fraudulently a name which has not law . " 
case liliane bettencourt : fran√ßois-marie banier will be judged for abuse of weakness 
the court in nanterre decided friday to judge the artist fran√ßois-marie banier to determine if , as in accuses the daughter of the billionaire liliane bettencourt , it has taken advantage of a state of weakness of the 80-year-old for the plunder of part of his fortune . 
the photographer of 62 years , known for his photographs of stars , will be judged on 15 and 16 april 2010 for abuse of weakness , a criminal offence to a maximum penalty of three years in prison and 375.000 euros fine . 
this decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families of france , in which a mother and daughter are squabbling with each other while taking the reins of the empire of cosmetics the or√©al . 
but the 15th house alleged has also ordered that a medical expertise of liliane bettencourt , aged 87 , should be waged collectively by three doctors . 
heir and main shareholder of the or√©al has always refused to submit to such a review , at least not in the terms offered by the public prosecutor of nanterre during the investigation . 
doctors appointed on friday will issue a report before 10 march 2010 by saying especially if liliane bettencourt was able to find in a state of weakness and what periods . 
i think it will . 
i am going to talk , said at the exit of the hearing mrs bettencourt 's lawyer , georges kiejman . 
for its part , the lawyer of fran√ßoise bettencourt-meyers , olivier metzner , welcomed the decision of the court . 
this is excellent news ( ... ) the expertise will show that he ( mr banier ) has manipulated this elderly lady that we must protect , he said . 
for two years , the single girl liliane bettencourt has engaged in criminal proceedings against fran√ßois-marie banier , photographer and touche-√†-tout artist , which it accuses of having benefited for years from the weakness of his mother to obtain a billion euros of donations , in the form of cheques , life insurance contracts or paintings of masters . 
for its part , liliane bettencourt has always refuted have been manipulated by the photographer , which it regards as a longstanding friend . 
while the court should examine the admissibility of the action taken by mrs bettencourt-meyers , the pleadings lawyers have sometimes turned to large family display friday . 
thus , the lawyer of liliane bettencourt reported three letters sent by his client ( in 1999 , 2003 and 2005 ) to his notary , in which she said beware the husband of fran√ßoise bettencourt-meyers . 
in the letter dated 2003 liliane bettencourt added , according to the lawyer : " could you explain to my daughter that i wrote to banier once , twice a day for 15 years . 
fran√ßoise , i have never been able to speak to him since his marriage " . 
for its part , the public prosecutor of nanterre has again estimated that the complainant was not admissible to act as a judge of the supervisory authorities refused these last few days with its request to open a process of judicial protection for his mother . 
liliane bettencourt " has full capacity to act , it is not under protection and has no sponsor . 
nobody else has to act in his place , " said the representative of the public prosecutor , marie-chrsitine daubigney . 
the tribunal has finally decided that it is consulted once the trial will take place on the admissibility of mrs bettencourt-meyers . 
managerial revolution or end of economic intelligence ? 
if nothing changes in the governance of big french companies , our struggle for the development of the economic intelligence will have been in vain ... 
for more than a decade , the attitude of the management of large companies toward its employees , recalls the position of the companies toward consumers before the revolution marketing : it is about to join the staff to " values " determined to high as they once were , to impose the consumer products invented by the technicians of the factory . 
by putting the customer at the heart of the company , the marketing revolution has called the strategies of conquest of markets to the place ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected factors of clienteles preferences of back regularly ! 
a demobilisation of employees can lead to a deadly demoralisation . 
suicides at france telecom , psa and renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon which particularly affects the frameworks . 
this demobilization seriously undermining the development of all intellectual functions of the company , including r & d and , even more , the intelligence economic . 
indeed , ie " requires all the stakeholders ( ... ) a pro-active and a forward-looking vision " ; it requires the part of employees a commitment that the revenue management bedevil authoritarian completely . 
that is why we are calling for a revolution managerial skills to set the staff at the centre of the company in the same way that the customer . 
the usefulness of any internal surveys 
opinion polls -comme internal the questionnaire submitted by orange to its salari√©s- will encourage this revolution in the practices manag√©riales ? 
unfortunately , i fear not . 
- firstly because i saw that , faced with a new situation , any structure is eventually , after detours , primarily ... what it has always done . ! 
- then , because authoritarianism -une pathologies of pouvoir- grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures . 
- finally , because most of the leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior . 
from the great engineering schools , they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology . 
they adopt , by intellectual comfort , the old theory behavioriste , cranked up recently by the " neuroscience " american and widely distributed , unbeknownst to them , by the institutes of studies and the media . 
thus , suggesting that it is possible to handle the " levers " ( sic ) of the commitment of executives , a recent survey of ipsos appeared in the figaro.fr it reinforces the leaders in a posture of governance , mechanistic unsuited to the world today . 
identify and measure the factors of mobilisation 
on the contrary , the revolution managerial skills necessary to the proper functioning of the modern companies , suppose to adopt a final vision of human behavior . 
it is to incorporate in any reasoning or practice of governance , a fundamental observation : for employees , the commitment to the company is only possible if it is clear as a means of achieving a part of their dreams , their ambitions , of their projects . 
currently , only the studies from the analysis motifonctionnelle adopt this design of the motives of the employees . 
these studies have shown that they consider their company based on a predetermined ideology that allows them , through their image seen of the company , to assess what it offers them to achieve their life plans . 
thanks to the identification and to the extent these factors of mobilisation , business leaders can control , predict and anticipate their " social performance " and put their management of human resources " to the place . " 
they create a breeding ground for development of a concerted economic intelligence robust and effective . 
oslo speech : " just war " is worth of praise to right to obama 
the american right has welcomed friday the speech the eve in oslo by barack obama , pleased that the nobel peace prize 2009 has defended the concept of " just war " against the enemies of the united states . 
the conservatives , who had brocard√© awarding the prize to mr obama on 9 october , applauded this time the speech , like sarah palin , former vice-presidential candidate in the 2008 elections . 
i liked what he said , said mrs palin , heroine of the right wing of the republican party in the usa today newspaper , adding having itself addressed the subject of the war " sometimes necessary " in his memoirs that have just been published . 
the war is , of course , the last thing in my opinion that the americans want to have to do , but it is necessary . 
we must stop these terrorists everything out there , it has estimated . 
mr obama , who has inherited the two wars of his predecessor george w. bush in iraq and afghanistan , has used thursday to oslo to justify the use of force , a way to explain his decision to send additional troops to afghanistan 30.000 nine days earlier . 
another opponent of mr obama , newt gingrich , has estimated that the president had done to oslo " a very good job . " 
i found that the speech was really very well , welcomed the former chairman of the house of representatives , which has especially liked the reference to " the existence of evil in the world " in the presidential words . 
by some hand , i found this speech quite historic , said mr gingrich , questioned during the radio programme " the takeaway . " 
the former elected , regarded by some as a possible candidate for the republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election , has said it is pleased to have seen " a president left " remind members of the nobel committee " that they would not be free and could not put a price of peace if the use of force did not exist . " 
for michael gerson pen , former george w. bush handed over to the washington post columnist , mr obama gave a speech " very american . " 
in addition to present themselves in " citizen of the world " as " he always does , " " he spoke as an american president , " reminding the european " that they live in a bubble of security that they have not created , and they do not do much to preserve it , " said mr gerson . 
among the few right not to be convinced , a falcon to the bush era , the former ambassador to the united nations john bolton , has called the speech " dull , spouted and without inspiration " on the site national review online . 
has the left of the president , the democratic representative dennis kucinich has alarmed to see barack obama justify the use of force . 
when we wraps the war in the notion of justice , we can easily justify the killing of innocent people , he warned . 
the press centre-left glowing , however , remained in the place of the president . 
the los angeles times , while continuing to think that the nobel was awarded prematurely to mr obama , has described his speech " superproduction " even for a speaker known for his talent . 
the speech of oslo " should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflicts , poverty and oppression , " has reignited the californian daily . 
mr obama " gave the speech that " we need , has estimated the new york times , deeming it " both dark and edifying . " 
drivers : three marathons for an agreement that saves the supplies of christmas 
after three sessions of n√©gociations-marathon , unions of the road sector and tlf , only employers organisation to be stayed until the end , arrived friday night in an agreement that puts an end to the strike and the threat to the supply of christmas . 
in the sitting signatures on friday evening , the secretary of state for transport , dominique bussereau , is " pleased " of this agreement , after several sessions of negotiations , launched on wednesday morning . 
after a second night of discussions the negotiators were left in the morning on friday , with the hope of signing quickly by the end of the morning the text of the agreement . 
and even if three employers ( fntr , unostra , otre ) had slammed the door . 
but it took more than six hours of a meeting began at 11 a. m so that everyone agrees and 6 to the text was signed . 
the conflict " would have been very damaging for businesses " and " it was feared that it vienna disrupt the holiday season , " said mr bussereau . 
the text provides a wage increases of 4 % for the lowest wages ( in the local and regional road transport ) , and 2,9 % for the highest ( international transport ) . 
in hourly rate for the bas-salaires , " you go from 8,72 eur 9,06 . 
it 's not a big thing , but we are very far , said patrice closed ( fo ) . 
this or we will give the order to our activists that there are no blockages , not blockade of refuelling centres . 
but we can always have a few that are not happy , he added . 
philippe grillot , president of tlf , welcomed " a good agreement , " even though it was " difficult to concede the increases on the top earners given international competition . " 
according to him , the increases will be of the order of 170 euros for the monthly low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest . 
that is the agreement of common sense and the respect of employees , said maxim dumont ( cfdt ) , while thierry douine ( cftc ) has welcomed a " historic agreement . " 
richard jaubert ( cgt ) has raised " a compromise acceptable . " 
the agreement also provides for the upgrading of travel costs of 3 % , and the holding of general state of road transport in the first half of 2010 , which will allow us to address the issue of a 13th months and modernisation of the collective bargaining agreement . 
mr bussereau has reminded us that " a drop of 100 million euros in employer contributions " has been the subject of a government amendment to the bill of amending finances for 2009 , voted thursday night on friday by the national assembly . 
the government will ask the senate to vote " in the same term . " 
the signing of tlf allows the agreement applies in a prime time to businesses adh√©rentes this organization , and in a second time , to the whole profession , in the case of extension by the minister of labour . 
it will be , " as soon as possible , " assured mr bussereau . 
the opposition of employers can only delay the process . 
the fntr has denounced a " fool , " because the 100 million euros " had already been promised the sector to compensate for some of the carbon tax . " 
the secretary of state for transport has forced to negotiate in the urgency , not in conclusion of a shared analysis , but not to thwart the next eaters turkey store , has deplored the unostra . 
for the otre , the agreement risk " digging the grave of a very large number of smes in the sector in the next 12 months . " 
rer has : disruption this weekend , unions unhappy with proposals for the ratp 
the disruption on the rer has the biggest line of urban public transport of france , will continue during the weekend , while a meeting on friday to the 2nd day of strike between unions and management of the ratp has left on their hunger as to their demand for premium . 
saturday and sunday , for this important weekend shopping before christmas , there will be of trains between sets and 8 p. m . , because of a train on two on the central section ( between defence and nation ) and a train on four outside the central section . 
the interconnection with sncf will be suspended at nanterre prefecture , which will force passengers to change train . 
the galleries lafayette , who expect 200.000 clients every day , were happy the fact that " the ratp made efforts to serve the big shops . " 
the rer has crosses from west to east agglomeration of paris . 
the ratp stretch short of nanterre saint-germain-en-laye and to boissy-saint-l√©ger and marne-la-vall√©e . 
on friday , about a train on two circulated at peak hours , and almost no rowed in empty hours , as planned . 
as on thursday , there has been no melee on the docks , the franciliens having organised . 
and in the morning , the station of saint-germain-en-laye ( yvelines ) was much less crowded than usual , for example , in the absence of middle school students and high school students . 
has boissy-saint-l√©ger ( val-de-marne ) , jack nbakina , engineer of 29 years , explained to be lifted " half an hour earlier , to be sure to arrive at the time . " 
the station saint-lazare has not undergone saturation , has indicated the sncf , which had planned a framework of officials and security forces . 
the rer has made by sncf from or to cergy-le-haut arrived or left the station saint-lazare to join the subways . 
new general assemblies of strikers will be held saturday and sunday , which will be looking at the results , deemed " meager " by the trade unions , a meeting with management on friday afternoon . 
the director of the rer proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the rer has on all aspects , working time , progress of career etc . 
this is not what want drivers , who are calling for a premium due , according to thierry garon ( south ) . 
the ratp puts even its proposals of premium incidentally , has outraged the cgt , stressing that the direction " was not bust to solve a problem while in the road and the sncf it is done . " 
a further meeting is planned on monday for " a wider review of the conditions of exercise of the profession , " said the ratp . 
what has been also say the unions that the company " had no interest of users of the weekend . " 
in the morning , some 150 drivers had invaded a committee of establishment at the headquarters in paris . 
it is then that the direction , which refused until then any discussion during the strike , suggested " in the interests of appeasement " the meeting . 
the conflict threatens to widen the rer b tuesday , after the tabling of a notice by unsa and independent . 
the trade unions demand a premium of 120 euros ( unsa ) to 150 euros which eur 30 variables ( cgt , fo , cfdt , south , independent ) and complain about the conditions of degradation work on this line of the 1 million passengers daily . 
the drivers of rer , all in the second part of career , affect of 2.200 to 2.700 gross euros and 600 to 650 euros of premiums , the odds , the hours sundays and holidays . 
the turkish courts dissolved the pro-kurdish decision with serious consequences 
the turkish constitutional court said friday the dissolution of the main pro-kurdish party in the country , a decision which was immediately followed by demonstrations of anger in the kurdish community , in the south-east of the country and istanbul . 
this decision could greatly complicate the task of the government , which has just reach out to the kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict . 
the democratic society party ( dtp ) was dissolved because it had become a " home of activities prejudicial to the independence of the state and to its unity indivisible , " said the press the president of the court hasim kili√ß , at the end of four days of deliberations . 
the decision was taken to the unanimity of the 11 judges , while a qualified majority of seven was required to give the dissolution , said mr kili√ß , adding that 37 senior party , including its president ahmet t√ºrk and the member aysel tugluk , are banned from politics for five years . 
the judge also announced the closure of the parliamentary immunity had enjoyed t√ºrk mr and mrs tugluk by the treasury and the confiscation of assets in the party . 
the dtp has 21 seats in parliament ( on 550 ) . 
its leaders had warned before the verdict that members leave parliament rather than sit as members without label . 
the decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the court of cassation abdurrahman yal√ßinkaya , which accuses the dtp to obey the " guidelines " of the kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) , considered a terrorist organisation by ankara and many countries . 
many observers believe that the dtp is the showcase legal policy rebels of the pkk . 
the party holds , however , that it has " no organic " links with the pkk but refuses to describe this terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with him . 
the court 's verdict comes at a time when the government has to reach out to the kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights , to try to stem the support of the kurds to the pkk and put an end to the conflict . 
the leaders of the dtp had said that a dissolution could lead to an escalation of tension in the south-east anatolian , where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the pkk leader abdullah √∂calan degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks . 
when the news of justice , a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the dtp in diyarbakir , the main city in the south-east populated by majority of kurds . 
the police fired tear-gas grenades and used water cannon , while protesters throwing molotov cocktails or stones , with insurrections . 
a hundred people protested also in istanbul . 
after the verdict , mr t√ºrk said that the decision of the justice system was " deepening despair . " 
turkey cannot resolve this issue ( kurdish , ndlr ) by banning a party , he said in the press . 
the government , formed by a party from the islamist movement , has also deplored the decision . 
we are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties . 
it solves nothing , said minister of energy taner yildiz . 
this decision is a total torpedoing the democratic opening launched by the government , said political analyst ahmet insel . 
one can expect , of course , a reaction of the pkk , he added . 
on thursday , the pkk has claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of turkey , one of the deadliest of these last few months . 
the first snow can fall 
what would wolfgang brauburger , it is a winter of rigorous . 
but the head of the service of spadework and sablage roads ( fes ) makes it clear that this is not to annoy the citizens . 
it is simply that the agents can test the technique of vehicles and learn to control them . 
and after the m√©t√©rologues , it could well be for this weekend . 
more than 300 agents and 120 vehicles is ready to tackle the snow and ice . 
the fes follows a very elaborate plan . 
mr brauburger explains that as soon as it starts to neiger on the city of frankfurt and that temperatures down below zero , large vehicles of sablage travel 20 main routes used ( so-called routes has ) . 
this includes the streets to great movement , the main arteries , as the neue weg and hanauer landstra√üe . 
are also included the access firefighters , the routes of public transport , the walkability and streets in slope like the atzelbergstra√üe . 
the agents of fes start their service to three hours of the morning . 
in times of need , the no 1040 miles of roads must be salt with a road basis which adheres well , in 3 hours maximum . 
that is why the service of fes starts at 3h in the morning " so that the roads to be released when starts the trafficking of daily migration . " 
where it gets more difficult , it is when the snow starts to fall √†7h30 in the morning . 
this causes problems , says the head of the service of spadework and sablage roads " because no driver is prepared to miss the salting vehicles . " 
then , if it does more snow , we access routes and roads of servicing - as the rat-beil-stra√üe . 
the sidings and streets lat√©rales come last . 
mr brauburger knows that it is always a few complaints . 
has five hours of the morning , the team 's pedestrian fes gets in the way to reach in priority areas deemed dangerous and the passages . 
about the bike lanes , the services of fes usually do not deal with it . 
mr brauburger specify that there is a special service in frankfurt is responsible to monitor the state bridges between 22 hours and 4 . 30 . 
as the ice to form very quickly on these surfaces , the vehicles of intervening salting as soon as the temperature falls below 2 degrees . 
it also happens that the police to appeal to this special service snack of need . 
the cradle of dinosaurs 
the tawa hallae looked like the other carnivorous dinosaurs : this upright was about 2 feet long for 1,50m high , after its members were powerful , his skull lying was provided teeth ac√©r√©es recourb√©es , his short arms and third countries were coming to an end by claws in sickle and he had a long tail . 
if this species had lived a few million years later , it would not have been exceptional . 
but , as reports sertling nesbitt of the university of texas in austin and his colleagues in the journal science on thursday , the tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs containing the morpho-functional characteristics . 
this animal lived 215 million years ago in new mexico who faisait√† the time part land masses of supercontinent , the pangea and was to the equator . 
sertling nesbitt said that the discovery of tawa sheds a new light the evolution of the first dinosaurs . 
indeed , it tells us the ties of kin , the distribution and characteristics of the latter . 
it is in 2006 that sertling nesbitt has undertaken searches in the company of other these paleontologists , on the site of gohst ranch in northern new mexico 
randall irmis of the natural history museum in utah and a member of the team searches tells it happens sometimes find a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a layer s√©dimentaire dating from the trias . 
scientists have very soon realised that a portion of these bones belonged to a new species . 
the surveys have updated the remains of five specimens . 
a discovery that confirms the theories about the beginnings of dinosaur evolution . 
researchers have dubbed it the name of tawa after the word of the indians hopi people for the god of the sun . 
for sterling nesbitt , it is a quite exceptional discovery : the fossils of dinosaurs from the trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of bone incomplete . 
all the experts in paleontology do not share this enthusiasm . 
for example , martin sander of the university of bonn does not find that this discovery is particularly dramatic , it says , however , that it enables us to confirm some theories about the beginnings of dinosaur evolution . 
according to the current state of knowledge , the dinosaurs have emerged on earth there is about 230 million years ago . 
most fossil of the older , however , are fragmented and incomplete which makes it very difficult the classification of all first dinosaurs . 
the experts are wondering , among other things , to what time the sauriens were divided into three groups of major developments : the th√©ropodes ( carnivores ) who understand the t. rex and the velociraptor emerged later and whose down the birds , the sauropodes quadrupedal animals , the long neck , and those who are related and the herbivores ornithischiens including the species such as the triceratops and st√©gosaure . 
according to the studies of s. nesbitt and his colleagues , tawa is one of the first th√©ropodes . 
this species to present a report interesting features both primitive and developed , said s. nesbitt . 
researchers have found signs that suggest that the tawa hallae poss√®dait small air bags in his bones in the skull , just as the birds that are the descendants of th√©ropodes . 
these small pockets of air facilitate the breath of birds compared to mammals . 
it seems that in the tawa hallae , the vertebrae have also been partially met air . 
according to randall irmis , the tawa is one of the oldest th√©ropodes with small air bags in its bones . 
as the lines related the immense sauropodes owned also air bags and a backbone slight , we can assume that they already had a common ancestor of this innovation beneficial . 
three successive waves of migration to north america . 
as the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in south america , researchers have concluded that the sauriens were reported there . 
consequently , the three major lineages of evolution are divided and have spread from south america to the rest of the world that is to say the whole land masses who formed the supercontinent pangea . 
this seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of these paleontologists has also found the remains of two other th√©ropodes which are not particularly related . 
the three species can disembark from a common ancestor would have migrated , say researchers . 
alan turner of the natural history museum in new york and co-author of the journal science studies said that there would have been at least three waves of migration to north america . 
of course there are a few inconsistencies . 
martin sander , paleontologist in bonn said that there is a species even more , the former silesaure , who lived in poland which belongs to a group related to dinosaurs . 
according to him it may give a mistaken view because there is in south america a large number of fossils of dinosaurs that have been preserved so that there is virtually no on other continents . 
by contrast , how dinosaurs are they managed to become the dominant t√©trapodes of the secondary era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line the branch of reptiles , is still a mystery . 
at the time of the trias , dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles , such as with ancestors of present-day crocodiles and with many other sauriens . 
towards the end of the trias dinosaurs are spread over the entire planet , thereby promoting the development of many new species while others who were related , have disappeared between the trias and the jurassic . 
such a success , however , is not eternal . 
to explain this transformation , martin sander sees two hypotheses . 
there may have been a mass extinction to which the dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles have disappeared . 
or so , the dinosaurs were better suited and they have therefore been able to eliminate the competition on the ground . 
in any case , such a success is not eternal . 
150 million years later , the fall of a meteorite favorisal' development of a group of animals that had also developed during the trias and since that time essentially in the shadows : it was mammals . 
the solidarity of vienna in sao paulo 
the list is long and there are signatories of the world . 
there are those of professors from the university of toronto , of the university of cambridge , the university of vienna , or berkeley in california . 
there are those of lecturers from the university of naples , quebec , edinburgh , of new york , sao paulo , berlin or bremen . 
the evacuation by the police of the casino j.w. goethe university in frankfurt made waves across the planet . 
278 professors and teachers of the university j.w. goethe but also other institutions of higher education in germany , europe and north and south america , express their solidarity with the protesting students from campus westend . 
in a statement drafted in german and english they condemn the intervention of the police requested by the steering committee of the university . 
last week , the president of the university werner m√ºller-estler did evacuate buildings occupied by students and teachers in gr√®veapr√®s that walls and works of art have been daubed with graffiti . 
five students were injured during the evacuation . 
the signatories believe the damage did not justify " a violent also intervention from the commando police against students and teachers who had held their own progress . " 
the evacuation represents an " unacceptable breach " to freedom of research and education . 
the fact of focus exclusively on the acts of vandalism serves only to " delegitimise and criminalise the protest " and tries to forget the reasons for the mobilisation . 
the steering committee of the university is taken out of the debates that would be needed . 
lecturers are demanding that the criminal prosecution to be suspended immediately . 
the majority of the occupiers has not taken part in the degradation . 
legitimacy of protests 
young people from the trade union verdi of the services sector and the german confederation of trade unions ( dgb ) to show solidarity students . 
the protests are the legitimate expression of a growing concern for our own future , said alexander klein , regional secretary of young people from the trade union verdi . 
as to the minister of science of the land of eva hesse k√ºhne-h√∂rmann ( cdu ) , she has campaigned for the action taken by the president of the university and the police . 
we are grateful to the president of the university . 
any occupation and degradation of places is totally unacceptable , she said the regional parliament wiesbaden last thursday at the television programme aktuelle stunde . 
we understand the sense of protests but do not accept vandalism , has expressed the cdu member of the regional parliament peter beuth . 
the groups of the opposition party , the greens and the left ( the left ) did not share that opinion . 
the csu takes the pretext of a few walls peinturlur√©s to criminalise the protests , said janine wissler party of the left ( left ) 
instead of thinking about arguments and demands of students , shrugs off . 
the party of the left has tabled a motion which , after the minister of the interior to submit a report on the conditions of the intervention of the police . 
the new " silicon-valley " 
for a long time she had the reputation of city secret , banned the western visitors . 
zelenograd , one of the ten districts of moscow , was under the soviet regime , a place of research of the secret weapons , under strict supervision . 
today , with its 216 000 people to 37 miles from the center of moscow , the municipality has the reputation of being the " silicon valley soviet " . 
important places of production and research into micro and nano√©lectronique are implanted . 
as of september 2008 representatives of zelenograd created links with riedberg , place of science mehr - with university institutes and societies in the centre of innovations in frankfurt ( fiz ) . 
there were meetings reciprocal and last wednesday representatives of zelenograd and riedberg signed a " memorandum of close cooperation . " 
the signatories were the deputy mayor of moscow juri rosljak and the prefect anatoly smimov of zelenograd for the russian delegation , edwin schwartz head of section project for frankfurt . 
in 2010 , representatives of the fiz and smes , whose strong point is scientific research , will zelenograd for a seminar . 
scientific echange 
it is a scientific exchange sustainable . 
but also economic relations . 
it will allow the company to fiz into the russian market . 
unlike scientific societies russians want to obtain contracts in germany . 
zelenograd is the seat of institutions and companies soviet research famous . 
there is the institute of electrical engineering in moscow , the big firms sitronics and rosssijskaja-elektronika . 
the community was founded in 1958 as " socialist planned city " for research in weapons . 
zelenograd ( literal translation " green city " ) takes its name wooded hills in the heart which research centres are implanted . 
the project s21 : a brake for stuttgart 
we cannot put high enough the scale of the project stuttgart 21 . 
for its supporters , it is nothing less than " new heart of europe . " 
if you want . s21 , it is much more than the burial of a railway station , more than a massive construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of baden-w√ºrttemberg , in a despairing chaos of yards for a decade . 
stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 1980s . 
the stations front line , with approaches that third countries were coming to an end in full city , had a reputation at the time to be the relics of the technique of transport in the 19th century that were effect of sabot brake modern rail traffic because it was once a lot of time to get the engine of the back to the front . 
arrival , ruling the short , departure - that is what he should do . 
that is why the stations front line must disappear : in frankfurt and munich . 
and in stuttgart , too : a station of passing trains , which is half-way around on the rail trans-european between paris and budapest / bratislava where the slogan " heart of europe . " 
the project s21 will really begin , although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible to reality . 
even the most ambitious planners have acknowledged that the cost , to bury the station in the respective capitals of hesse and bavaria , was exorbitant . 
indeed , the stations front line are really more problems for the entry and exit since there are modern trains , reversible with autorails and voiture-pilote at both ends . 
however it is now launching the achievement of stuttgart 21 next to the new route of the inter-city line towards ulm . 
the policies regional and municipal prevailed . 
the company of the railways is in part because it is the taxpayer who made the costs of the risks of biggest infrastructure project of the federal republic and not the public . 
from the point of view town-planning this project is relatively well justified . 
you get a urban space which - according to the graphs planners generated by computer - will be very . 
for the system of rail transport the s21 is harmful . 
the station of passage and the enlargement of the section are designed for a traffic people which allowed - and that is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth . 
then there is still not competition cheap flights . 
the policy of the modern traffic should first focus on strengthening freight traffic because transport by rail is much more environmentally friendly as by truck on the road . 
but the new route , with its inclinaisons , is not to freight trains . 
the s21 , and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects . 
for example , six billion euros will be swallowed up in the draft of the swabian . 
this is the official figure . 
experts believe that 10 to 15 billion is more realistic . 
one thing is for sure , in the next decade the money involved for other points of interface and congestion in the network . 
the list of the ministry of transport mentions in any sixty large projects . 
one of the most important is the enlargement of the section through the rhine valley of 180 good kilometres . 
since 1987 the line is built in slow motion . 
it would be really urgent to support here in the substance of the fungus . 
but the project s21 fact the effect of a sabot braking . 
the route of the rhine valley is becoming the bottleneck freight traffic international , and this in the heart of europe . 
the government is considering the judgment on the airport 
the regional parliament of wiesbaden , the national government has raised the possibility of appeal to the judgement of the administrative court of hesse on the ban of air flights at night . 
the minister of economics dieter posch ( fdp ) has announced that the coalition cdu / fdp had entrusted experts to examine from a legal point of view the ruling by the administrative court and which is a document containing more than 400 pages . 
the court of kassel justified in a written document that the land should adapt the regulation on the ban of night flights in the case or the construction of the track to aterrissage north-west of frankfurt airport would be fulfilled . 
the authorisation of att√©rir for 17 aircraft between 23 : and five in the morning , as envisaged by the national government , is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against the night air pollution . 
the coalition must have decided for january 4 , if it wants to make an appeals process against the ruling . 
the opposition criticism this deadline and trying to put pressure on the government representative for celui-cirenonce the appeal of the federal administrative court of leipzig . 
the head of the parliamentary group spd torsten sch√§fer-g√ºmbel invite the cdu and the fdp to return to their promise made before the election , and was to ban night flights . otherwise , it will be condid√©r√© as a breach total to a word . 
it is so damned hard to be allowed to keep its word , said the leader of the greens tariq al-wazir alluding to the fdp √©l√©ctoral slogan " we keep our promises . " 
the minister dieter posch refute accusations of sch√§fer-g√ºmbel which claims that the national government is trying to allow when even the night flights using " avocasserie and roublardises . " 
it takes time to make a precise legal review . 
the coalition does not want to take a decision on the basis of a " rapid first impression . " 
it must be that the decision is legally reliable , said stefan m√ºller ( fdp ) . 
the interpretation of the opposition on the statements of his fraction on the ban of night flights is completely √©rron√©e . 
us banks repay the aid 
the big us banks , very affected by the crisis , have taken away from their ties to the state . 
the bank of america announced wednesday that it had repaid in full at the treasury $ 45 billion ( more than 30 billion euros ) , equivalent to aid in the framework of the tarp bailout plan . 
the chain of american television cnbc indicated in a report that citigroup also envisaged repay aid received . 
the banking institutions seek to get rid of the restrictions , which accompanied the acceptance of the are , as for example the limitation of bonuses awarded to leader as well as the regulation of higher charges . 
bank of america has launched a capital increase by the sale of securities from investors who told him 19 billion dollars of fresh money . 
the rest of the money comes from the coffers of the bank that are well met thanks to the sale of several branches of other sectors . 
last wednesday evening , kenneth lewis , the director general of the bank of america has kept expressly to thank the american taxpayers : the injection of capital greatly helped to overcome a difficult period . 
the banking institution had assumed its capabilities in buying the investment bank merrill lynch at the height of the financial turmoil . 
the citigroup is also considering raise money on the financial markets to free themselves from the state . 
the american bank could launch as early as thursday , a capital increase of 20 billion dollars , reported the chain cnbc quoting banking circles . 
the spokesman for citigroup did not wish to comment on this information . 
in june the banks goldman sachs , jp morgan chase and morgan stanley had repaid the public funds that they had received . 
election accelerated 
ultimately , it is when even spent more quickly than expected . 
just two weeks after the purge of the current taking the post of chief redacteur nikolaus brender by the board of the german chain zdf , the successor is already appointed . 
the commission wanted to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment . 
peter frey , who runs the drafting berlin zdf was the big favorite . 
the chain has not wanted to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure . 
however , it seems that there was also the desire not to further undermine steward of the zdf markus sch√§chter in case the proposal would not be accepted by the board . 
frey , who is the candidate of sch√§chter , had need the vote of nine members of the committee on 14 . 
the outcome of the vote was not yet known to the closing of the drafting of this edition . 
two weeks ago , sch√§chter had proposed to the board of five-year extension of the contract of nikolaus brender but this was rejected . 
only 7 council members were in favour of the renewal of brender and 7 others had voted against . the impeachment by vote of brender represented a failure although predictable for sch√§chter . 
indeed , the cdu majority on the board had already suggested several weeks before the vote , not wanting to renew brender to his post . 
it is roland koch , the prime minister of the land of hesse , who had organised a league against the editor . 
he had refused the contract of the esteemed redacteur in chief is extended , citing the fact that the rate of listening to the emissions of information from the zdf had fallen under brender . 
that is why the protests were still taking place , almost until the vote , lashing out at the growing political influence exerted on the zdf . 
at the end there was even 35 experts in public law who had intruded in the debate and who believed that the action of koch was unconstitutional . 
but this is for nothing . 
peter frey : who is it ? 
peter frey was born on 4 august 1957 to bingen . 
he has studied the sciences-politiques , the pedagogy etles romance languages ( spanish ) . 
he then worked at s√ºdwestfunk ( radio body of rhineland-palatinate ) and the german daily frankfurter rundschau ( national ) . 
in 1983 he becomes editor in the zdf first in news magazine " heute-journal " ( paper today ) . 
then its journey continues : from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy r√©dacteur-en-chef then ; then corresponding to washington in 1991 / 1992 , then , and until 1998 he was head and presenter of " morgenmagazins " ( emission of fortnightly information presented the morning ) ; until 2001 he was responsible for the service of foreign policy of the zdf then head of the berlin drafting . 
after the disgrace of brender , when it had just been elected journalist of the year by the journal medium magazin specialist , the greens have announced that they laid down a constitutional complaint 
the enemy of koch on the board , the prime minister of rhineland-palatinate kurt beck , said last week that the l√§nder should transform the intergovernmental treaty of the zdf so that the proposals to staff of steward cannot be blocked by a political majority biased . 
however , beck has no plans to ask for the withdrawal of politicians members of the committees for monitoring the zdf . 
peter frey , the likely successor to brender had manoeuvred cleverly to the council of administration vehemently criticising the commission in its decision to sack brender . 
thanks to this show of independence journalistic sch√§chter was able to propose for the post of r√©dacteur-en-chef without losing face , even as the board could elect without the soupconne to put in the post a supporter policy . 
in the representations arithmetic of parties , frey is classified , liberal left . 
cleansing in university studies 
partial success for students : after a year of educational strike the ministers of education and cultural affairs l√§nder decide to be more accommodating : at a meeting between ministers and the delegates of the conference of vice-chancellors , an agreement has been developed stating that the working conditions of students bachelor and masters had to be improved . 
in the future , students should be able to overcome their studies . 
they are particularly agreed to reduce the weight of the examinations : a single review should allow us to close the module of study chosen . 
in addition , the burden of work will have to be reconsid√©e to ensure " realistic proportions and acceptable . " 
the political authorities and higher education institutions want to facilitate the recognition of exams between universities and abroad . 
the states are also committed to hold joint structural requirements more flexible for the smuggling of bachelor and masters . 
at the regional level , there should be no different regulation of a land to the other . 
less examinations 
since the beginning of the student protests last june , the education minister l√§nder and university rectors have repeatedly in the mouth the buzzword : " √©tudiabilit√© . " 
but for the first time , this expression seems to take a practical significance . 
the accreditation council has decided to greatly reduce the number of some exams : " each module must be reached by a single examination , " writes a document of a thirty pages on the future conditions for admission to the university cycles . 
reinhold grimm , president of the council of accreditation says that significantly reducing the burden of the examinations we should be able to stop the slide , which hurting considerably in the √©tudiabilit√© . 
" √©tudiabilit√© " should also be , in the future , the decisive criterion of the organization of studies . 
the modules as the substance must be examined carefully to see if we can avoid this feeling of stifling that it sometimes feels in the choice of course . 
hamburg / berlin - according to the latest knowledge on kunduz raid , the opposition believes that the minister of defense karl-theodor zu guttenberg ( csu ) is guilty of deliberate deception . 
students should " have the opportunity and the leeway to allow and encourage the personal initiative . " 
the new regulation will apply to access to the new university rounds but will also be adapted to the existing cycles . 
these cycles must be " r√©accr√©dit√©s " every five years , which means , however , that it is only by 2015 that all rounds have been examined . 
there are 10 agencies competent accreditation on the entire federal territory who depend on accreditation council created by the l√§nder . 
in october , the ministers of education had exerted some pressure on the l√§nder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes are not too loaded and the regime exams not too strict . 
in some l√§nder , universities and specialist colleges have already heard with their regional ministries to take the appropriate measures . 
the rhineland-palatinate is so far the only land to have agreed to give more money to the development of the bologna process . 
with these funds , universities must organise massive programmes and strengthen the offices of educational guidance as well as the offices of examinations and the service of international relations 
the l√§nder and universities to provide a budget of 10 million euros . 
in early 2010 , the government wants to submit to parliament an amendment to the law on the institutions of higher education . 
following this , there will be no more than a single review to close his studies . 
the organisation studies must be more flexible , more , it must be able to ensure the recognition of increased notes other institutions of higher education and access to the master 's needs to be simplified . 
by the end of next year , the " √©tudiabilit√© " all the university cycles will be examined . 
last thursday , the government and the opposition again have debated the question of study conditions in the country . 
the decisions were appreciated but there have been some criticisms . 
the federal president of the union of students socialists has indicated that he would like the organisation of the educational policy is more in the future " behind closed doors " of ministers and the rectors of universities . 
at the latest after the strike educational , students as people concerned should be able to speak a little . 
the future diplom√©s of higher education we received the support of president delegates from the conference of vice-chancellors ( hrk ) margret wintermantel : " the experience of students we is very useful , " she said thursday during a meeting with the education ministers l√§nder with which the hrk is working on a plan to reform common . 
for the trade union of education and science ( gew ) the decisions taken in bonn do not go far enough . he is calling for the law and the possibility for each graduate bachelor to register to a cycle of masters . 
andreas keller member of the steering committee of gew request that the l√§nder provide students bachelor today , that tomorrow there will be enough places for studies in the masters and the conditions of studies as good as possible . 
the l√§nder must therefore hire more responsible . 
by contrast , the ministers of education have not mentioned the possibility of ease access to the masters . 
more than a note at the bottom of page on herta m√ºller 
it is by these words " arrival in germany and it is a beautiful , almost more control ... " that begins the poet werner s√∂llner , in which he th√©matise in scraps phrases puzzling , the experiences of a dissident arrived in germany that won the freedom , but has lost at the same time its territory language . 
werner s√∂llner , born in 1951 to banat in romania , was first professor of german and english to bucharest and , subsequently , director of collection in a publishing house for youth before settling in frankfurt on the hand . 
s√∂llner has received various literary prize ; in 1993 , he was the much-desired professorship of poetry of goethe university in frankfurt and since 2002 it is director of the forum of literature of hesse to the house of artist of mousonturm in frankfurt . 
he has done a lot of talk about him in literary circles not last tuesday , during a congress in munich , whose theme was " the german literature in romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your files securitate . " 
visibly destabilized and embarrassed , s√∂llner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his colleagues germano-roumains writers like richard wagner , william totok , franz hodjak , and helmuth frauendorfer that he had worked as an informant for the police securitate policy . 
s√∂llner received in 1989 , the price of the german language , together with some of the participants . 
the trials of recruitment had begun insidiously in 1971 . 
i am , concludes s√∂llner " so someone who has not been able to resist the trials of intimidation of the securitate . " 
the poet werner s√∂llner is the informant walter ( im walter ) . 
almost simultaneously with the honoration nobel prize for herta m√ºller and his literary disentangled copies with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship , the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of german authors from romania , for a case which clearly shows the abyss and the heinous act of a political system , based on police surveillance and espionage . 
werner s√∂llner is , as far as we can tell by the current knowledge , not just guilty but also victim . 
in his own dossier securitate , im walter has played a role , ensures the specialist literature michael markel after the confession of s√∂llner and it refers to the positive influence of im walter who had intervened in its favour . 
" he had been able to learn from all the difficult situations at the time , " after markel . 
markel moralde felt the need to make this comment . 
the form in which s√∂llner made his statement and before this public was unexpected , however , the admission of a former dissident its cooperation with the romanian secret services is , in fact , not so surprising . 
germany is a reserve enjoyable for the spies of the securitate had already written herta m√ºller in july in the journal " die zeit , " having read the 914 pages of his own dossier . 
we can assume that the victims have made of speculation and sometimes have guessed what real names last hid the names of loans sorin , voicu and also walter . 
instead of germany where between time consultation of files of the stasi is a process reliable , the attitude to the legacy of the files of the securitate is still very confused . 
a systematic explanation has been repeatedly frustrated and slowed in the past . 
it was not until 1999 that a national council corresponding to the institution birthler has been created to work to assimilation of archives of the securitate ( cnsas ) but the return of the files has dragged on since . 
there are since 2005 a law which defines the management of archives . 
that the influence of former members of the securitate in romania is still very high , is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the securitate of temesvar which , after the announcement of the award of the nobel prize to herta m√ºller , is so dismissive very extended to the winner . 
she had a psychosis , and ultimately had questioned only once . 
the disgrace of power was thought to be able to speak here , without any gene , under the guise of freedom of expression . 
of course , inevitable questions are involved in the case s√∂llner as so often happens in a context of guilt hidden . 
why now ? which has been deprived ? the reaction of the listeners , the admission of s√∂llner , gives us hope that the result of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst to know that by accusations and a sense of shame . 
on the genesis of the work of herta m√ºller , who has yesterday received the nobel prize , it is more than a note at the bottom of the page . 
turmoil in the champions league 
we had the impression that a representative came here , best coming straight from a christmas party cool , on which the manufacturer of articles of sport had spread its goods when the new coach vfb christian gross monta at a quarter to midnight in a mercedes c class , he had just call , an orange plastic bag of supplier to the hand . 
the man , whose skull bald drew attention , allowed himself to drive in the city that it was still foreign . 
otherwise our quinquag√©naire could take itself the wheel - he had not drunk alcohol , and this was not drunk happiness . 
he had spent a pleasant evening but tomorrow we had to go back to work . 
because it is now that it was going to start . 
the words of switzerland that we had to take three days earlier were clear : " we have reached the final eighth of , " that is to say in the champions league thanks to our 3 : 1 against unirea urziceni romania " but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by the success . it will be a brutal struggle not to fall . " 
the " hard work " we expected sunday . 
here , it is to repeat in mainz the results of the champions league on a daily basis . 
and it will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three goals of hurried marica ( 5 . ) , tr√§sch ( 8 . ) and pogrebnyak ( 11 ) . 
lottery 
the eighth final of the champions league match go 16 . / 17 . + 23 . / 24 february / return match 9 . / 10 . + 16 . / 17 march ) will be drawn to the fate the 18 december in nyon . 
the joy of the entry of the successor to cap pistols babbel was therefore moderate . 
and the joy was not only moderate among those who brought a chance , which had forwarded professionals in stuttgart destabilised , motivated and the pleasure of play . 
i have been to see the players and i told them that they should concentrate on their strengths , i have advised them to be more courageous , explained the plumber " souls " - gross - the recipe for success that sounded if bienmais who was more of an effect with the healer babbel . 
it has triggered a certain magic , confessed jens lehmann - supporter of babbel - , " in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that you would never have believed possible . " 
and sami khedira who , after weeks of pause to injury , proposed as the best player thanks to his dynamism , tried to describe the " phenomenon " seen by a proverbial " fresh winds " and the method of work of the new leader : " this is someone who is taking action and requires discipline . 
that is what we need in the current situation . " 
but apparently babbel had missed . 
the vfb stuttgart has not yet passed the course , warned the manager horst heldt 
for the moment , vfb stuttgart are in need of tenacity . 
just as gross , the players and the manager tightlipped about to overstate the victory against a defense totally overwhelmed and weakened guests romanians . 
they had also won in glasgow before having had four days later a bad awakening to leverkusen with the 0 : 4 , objecta khedira . 
horst heldt , the manager , signala they had well reached one of the goals of the season but they had other which were still very far . 
we have not yet past the difficult hurdle . 
that heldt the day of his 40th anniversary does not have the heart to celebrate , even after the first victory at home for three months , is due to the events of the weekend that a television interview the guardian of aim jens lehmann did pick up just before the start of the game . 
there are decisions that other take and not jens , contrecarrait heldt , in response to the criticism of lehmann . 
he accused the direction of weakness of style and said that it had decided to change of coach under the pressure of pubertaires fans . 
lehmann had judged also as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and envy the fact that his day of free after games he has been removed . 
the statements of lehmann were " marked by a pure selfishness " slid heldt and announced the consequences for the guardian of goal . 
they risked more become friends for life these two 40-year-olds . 
in any cast , they agreed to everything else , that is to say that without the work of the group by the coach replaced , the strong sports representation restive and would not have been possible . 
babbel and his assistants have been " for a large part in the success " r√©torqu√®rent heldt and lehmann together - and even the man in the plastic bag acquies√ßa . 
world championship of lorries 
hot battle in bern : kevin johnson -style challenger constantly verbally and gestuellement the champion of the world vitali klitschkos . 
but after 12 rounds difficult ukrainian advocated in 1764 his title of the world champion of hgvs , according to the version of the federation wbc . 
has the unanimity of judges he implied the points . 
hamburg - vitali klitschko retains his title of the world champion of heavy goods vehicles . 
the federation wbc announced that on the night of saturday , the champion of 38 years had won a victory to the points to the unaminit√© judges against the american kevin johnson ( 120 : 10 ) . 
for the third time klitschko defends with honour its title since his comeback on stage in october 2008 . 
before ukrainian had already won twice the title of world champion and wbc wbo federations . 
unfortunately it has not passed the long-awaited ko . 
klitschko , movie that came out 39 times winner in 41 fighting professionals , has conceded twice its defeat because of injuries . 
the challenger johnson has accept his first defeat in 24th fight . 
in the arena of berne , before 17.000 spectators , the great klitschko wanted above all to dictate the fight , the high of its 2,02 metres , by its against the left . 
johnson , of 11 inches smaller , which before the duel , had announced the end of the era klitschko , managed to avoid the blows of emp√©chant klitschko champion , and to his dangerous game against the right . 
johnson , too passive in action for a challenger , has mainly tried to move the rounds . 
although he continued to cause klitschko words and gestures attacks reached only very rarely the champion . 
it is the second boxer after timo hoffman in 2000 , has exceeded with klitschko the distance of the 12 rounds . 
the challenger had done a lot of noise in the swiss capital before the fight . 
it insulta klitschko " the dirty " zombie " is not really capable . " 
during the weighing on friday , the champion has not been able to prevent cause johnson in him removing his sunglasses nose " to be able to see its eyes . " 
fourth victory since the comeback of klitschkos . 
klitschko has imposed again in his fourth struggle since his comeback on 11 october 2008 
after a gap of nearly four years , he had beaten to the time the nigerian samuel peter in berlin and hijacked " its " wbc belt that he had previously abandon without a struggle . 
this year , defending his title of champion , it won the fight against juan carlos gomez of cuba , and in september against chris arreola of the us . 
" i just took a blow in this fight and am in perfect shape , " said klitschko to explain its rapid return on the ring . 
his r√®ve is to try to bring in the family the four titles , the most important . 
his brother wladimir is champion federations wbo and ibf . 
but it is the british david hague who , having d√©tron√© the great nikolai walujew - 2,13 metres - in november , bears the belts of the wba . 
this summer , hague had cancelled a match against vitali klitschko which was to have taken place in september . 
it appears that his development company intends to do play now this game at wembley stadium in london . 
the case kunduz 
frontal attack of the opposition : the head of the green group , j√ºrgen trittin , has accused the minister of defense guttenberg of lying in the case of the case kunduz . 
the spd party and the left ( the left ) ask the chancellor explanations . 
hamburg / berlin - after considering the latest information on the air attack of kunduz , the opposition has accused the minister of defence karl-theodor zu guttenberg ( csu ) to have d√©lib√©r√©mentdissimul√© some facts . 
the minister has intentionally " made a fiction " on the murderous hits two tankers in september , said the head of the green group , j√ºrgen trittin , on saturday during the emission of information of the chain " tagesschau ard " ( the journal of 20h ) . 
clearly , this means that he lied . 
the order to kill , was given in total disregard for the rules of the international security assistance force in afghanistan ( isaf ) . 
it is , in essence , the content of the report available to nato and which has been read by mr guttenberg trittin , said . 
last friday , according to new revelations of the media , the aim of lafrappe was in reality , not to destroy the stolen trucks , but sought to eliminate two taliban leaders important . 
according to the report of the inquiry of nato , 142 people had been killed or injured in the attack american airline which was launched at the request of the german colonel goerg klein , military commander of kunduz . 
the greens , the spd and the left have asked saturday chancellor angela merkel ( cdu ) , to vote as soon as possible before the federal parliament and reveal what guttenberg really knew on the incident . 
j√ºrgen trittin and his colleague from the green party renate k√ºnast are of the opinion that mrs merkel must say clearly if the strategy of targeted massacre is part of the government 's afghan policy f√©d√©ralet if the chancellery , the army and intelligence services have approved the new strategy . 
the government spokesman categorically reject these criticisms . 
the chancellery has in no way influenced the interventions of the army in afghanistan , he said . 
on saturday , the voices were increasingly strong to express doutesquant the real reasons the referral of the inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan and the secretary of state peter wichert , such that it had been presented by the ministry . 
according to the intelligence of the newspaper spiegel , the information that they had called to guttenberg concerning the attack tankers were both accurate and complete . 
officially , they would have concealed the existence of the report of nato and hidden the minister some details troublesome . 
in the vicinity of the two senior officials , it suggests , however , that they have informed the ministry of defence of the existence of several reports , including a document of two pages of colonel klein as well as a report by military police . 
" the frankfurter allgemeiner sonntagszeitung reported that " wichert would have meanwhile demanded in a letter a clarification of the facts . 
so far , it has not been answered 
on saturday , the ministry did not wish to comment on the allegations and referred to the committee of inquiry of the federal parliament which was going to be the next wednesday in order to provide the light on the events in question . 
the worlds of dream 
some see , while awake , images and hear voices that nobody else sees or hears . 
it is not only among the sick mental or under the influence of drugs , that the limits between imagination and reality mix . 
as long as these phenomena occur during sleep , everything is going very well . 
when we are laying in our bedrooms overshadowed , we can do without barriers to dreams and wildest fantasies . 
however that , awake , experienced dream , hear and see things that others do not perceive , has quickly the reputation in our western world to be crazy or junkie , or at least be an original . 
such images and voices do not appear that among the mental ill or under the effect of the drugs . 
this is our imagination that is in question : this is the same neural activity which allows us to design houses , paint pictures or write novels , but that sometimes prompts the boundaries between the dream , madness and reality to melt . 
a state of conscious awakening , taking the form of a dream , can be presented in the most diverse forms , in the best case we call this visions , at worst madness . 
but even if the trigger and the effect distinguish themselves , the visions of the mystical hildegard von bingen , the experiences of drugs in the prophet of the new age carlos castaneda , the latter of chamanes , psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to the process very similar . 
there are hallucinations or delusions when the balance , substances neurotransmettrices of the brain - first dopamine , noradrenaline , serotonin and ach√©tylcholine - breaks down and that the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted . 
hallucinations complex and wild thoughts are very often during a psychosis , schizophrenic . 
the force of earth 's attraction has more power on the person . 
since antiquity , philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between the madness and the dream . 
for aristotle , hallucinations were a form of r√™ve-√©veill√© ; wilhelm griesinger , one of the founders of modern psychiatry , found in 1861 " a great resemblance between the madness and the dream , " to sigmund freud the dream was even " a psychosis with all irregularities , imaginations , delusions and sensory illusions that the composed . " 
we are in the autumn of 2001 when henning t turns into a comic strip character . 
his body is in two dimensions to the criardes colors . 
the land attraction has more power on him , the tidal hangs from the ceiling . 
he feels a blow . 
behind him creatures of winged devil , grima√ßantes bloodstained , mouths , showing the teeth . 
they continue , give it a few feet with heavy boots flamboyantes , the cast against the walls , he feels the pain throughout the body . 
the thundering voice , evil , roar , coming out of the walls and the radio . 
it can no longer bear these voices who insult and humiliate him . 
henning t. severs two cables of its chain stereo , in fact a loop and attaches it to a hook set the ceiling . 
it gets on a baffle and happens the loop around the neck . 
he jumps . 
the loop stands out . 
that is a lesson to you , shouting the voice in a chorus to extract the eardrum . " goes in a clinic and fais-toi cure ! " 
today henning t. has 40 years ago , he lived six psychoses acute , the last date of 2 years , the first of nearly 20 years . 
it has been triggered by lsd . 
the diagnosis : schizo-affective psychosis , paranoid , in addition , it is has bipolar disorder , he takes medication for depression , the mania , schizophrenia . 
he has learned to live with his illness , he is married for three years . 
during the psychosis i lived fears terrible and despondency deep . 
illusions are a harsh reality . 
around one percent of the population is suffering at least once in their lives schizophrenia ; in the psychiatric clinic is the most common illness after the depression . 
in a crisis of schizophrenia , people can no longer make the difference between the inside and the outside world , they are in a state of hyper arousal , which means that they can suffer from hallucinations , megalomania , relational madness or persecution . 
it is very common to hear of votes - the voices that command , which elicited comments or chat . 
the optical hallucinations are not uncommon either . 
the person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the trivial , the brain can no longer filter the disruptive signals , the conscious is drowned under the sensations . 
just as the dream , the hype opens the floodgates to a tide of ideas and fantasies outcome of deeper layers of consciousness . 
the perception of reality in the hype is centered on the subject , according to professor thomas fuchs , head of the department of psychiatry of chu of heidelberg ( allgemeine psychiatry im universit√§tsklinikum ) . 
the schizophrenic is in the centre of the situation , all meaning focused on him . 
at the same time it is reflected in a passive role , it is like a dream , overcome by events and may not act on them in an active . 
that is why the schizophrenic often feel threatened , controlled , manipulated . 
in general they do not have the opportunity to adjust the reality , illusions are a cruel reality , wake up is excluded . 
to experience a time in his life of a hallucination . 
unlike the dream , according to fuchs , " the sensory structure space and the reality that is seen during the psychosis is fundamentally retained . " 
the thoughts and wild hallucinations are based on the reality , the alienation of the experienced takes place in a real framework . 
why our brain it this kind of antics , is still a mystery to researchers . 
exceptional situations can bring everyone to momentarily lose the perception of reality , according to fuchs . 
but only a small number of people develop a psychosis . 
there seems to have a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia , but studies of twins have shown that the genes are not the only factors . 
researchers assume that the people involved are tiny brain damage . 
we assume that the neural maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development , for example , by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy , explains fuchs . 
but what is still unexplained , this is the way the anomaly of the neural system happens and also the fact that it is not for many years . 
environmental factors also play a role - stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis , however , if there is predisposition . 
of even the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they operate on the neurotransmitters . 
when our brain heats up . 
this is crazy , we said professor of psychology erich kasten of l√ºbeck is that the suffering psychotic their hallucinations and take medicines expensive for getting rid of it while others buy drugs very expensive for obtaining them . 
the perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a matter of perspective . 
kasten brings together for ten years of reports on hallucinations and phenomena of images illusory : last year he published his results in a book entitled " the imaginary world in our head . " 
the hallucinations do well among the concomitant phenomena typical psychoses but also an impressive number of many other diseases . 
there are among they psychological problems such as borderline or depression but also the migraine , epilepsy , multiple sclerosis , alzheimer 's disease or head injury . 
it is surprising that in certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations . 
the hallucinations , according to kasten , consists of fragments of memories that are normally inhib√©s . 
they take form when the areas of the brain sensory perceptions , are overactive or not enough refr√©n√©es ; when our brain 's warm but also when there is lack of stimulation . 
drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or a psychosis . 
but the lack of stimulus , stress , the sorrows of love or other exceptional mental states . 
in recent studies , a third of participants acknowledges having done at least once in his life experience a hallucination . 
in summer 2005 sarah k. 16 years ago , she lives a small town of previous pomerania and it goes to the school . 
a young girl to do everything to normal to tell the truth . 
if there had not the images and voices . 
during the recess , sometimes a boy , thin , the long hair ch√¢tain , send him the floor . 
when she meets his comrades watch , surprised - nobody else sees or hears this boy . 
they believe that this young girl timid is a lunatic dreamer but sarah k not dream , it is certain . 
it is awake , hear and see this boy as she sees and hears the girl who is sitting next to it on the bench . 
it can even see its presence temporarily . 
it is a pleasant sensation , she finds this young sympathetic . 
am i crazy ? , wonder it sometimes . 
but she knows that this young and other visions are not real and that they are going to disappear again . 
the night the outbreaks are , in general , frightening 
often the visions are heavy . 
when it is in class , it is that it cannot follow the course , because the professor is right presenting a new pupil in her eyes and her ears when it is invisible to others and that the teacher is visibly explaining equations in the picture . 
the night the outbreaks are , in general , frightening . 
when , in the darkness of his bedroom , it expects the sleep which happens all too rarely and far too late , it often cannot distinguish if it is awake or dream already , if the images that she sees , faces grima√ßants or the girl with sanguinolentes cuts on the arms and legs are in front of their eyes open or closed . 
let me quiet , it screams to these creatures . 
it does not speak to his parents and his friends , they would for a crazy . 
autumn 2009 . sarah k. is now 20 years old . 
it has had its masters last year and she lives with his friend . 
it was a year ago hallucinations have ceased . 
since she came in contact by the internet with the psychologist kasten she knows very well that it is not crazy . 
the madness is also a work of art of despair . 
when someone is socially isolated or has not enough incentives , the likelihood is that he has hallucinations after a certain time . 
i assume that the brain is not quite busy , means that there are of animation . 
sarah k. , single girl , was afraid of other children when she was small and playing often alone . 
the hallucinations began when she learned to 13 years , that the man she called daddy , since she was in age of thinking , was not his real father . 
these are the same brain regions that are active for the visual hallucinations and acoustic , and for the impressions and real noises , so it is very difficult for people like sarah k to tell the difference between the illusion and reality . " every experience , " according to kasten " takes place in the brain , the reality is formed from there . 
hallucinations are also images that form in the brain , which is why they seem so real . " 
for kasten night , dreams are also a form of hallucination . 
the hallucinations of healthy people differ not fundamentally those acute psychoses . 
unlike the schizophrenic , the person mentally healthy is able to recognise that the fantasies are not actual pictures . 
that is why kasten advises her patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent . 
there is only a step between the dream and the hallucination . 
in our world too focused on the conscience has unfortunately been quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for diseases , according to michael schmidt-degenhard , a professor at heidelberg and doctor head of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy of the hospital florence nightingale in d√ºsseldorf . 
a psychosis is a serious illness , painful but which also contains something positive , creator - the madness is a work of art of despair . 
schmidt-degenhard has studied the form of so-called oniro√Øde experience , a particular form of the change of consciousness awake by the dream . 
the experienced oniro√Ødes semi-r√™ves are very complex which are perceived as real by anyone who lives and that he cannot differentiate the dream even when it is in a state of awareness . 
the state of consciousness oniro√Øde manifests itself for a trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathie which fully aware , are the experience of a paralysis engine . 
according to schmidt-degenhard , when a human being is threatened by a loss of itself and the world , due to a complete inability and sustainable move , it replaces the real situation which undermines his life , by his own fantasy world which is divorced from reality . 
it is a state of mental limit between the dream and the hallucination . 
as it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality , a change in the world has to take place , but the real situation is represented in the imagination . 
it is , in fact , a form of means and interpretation , in a situation intolerable in itself , a capacity of organisation which is given , to men , not to sink into the nothingness of the loss of consciousness . 
everything is real even later in the memories . 
the zurichois peter classen cornelius , art historian also describes his experiences oniro√Ødes in his book " change of heart " as action to safeguard the soul . 
it has 49 years ago , at a time when its aware hand for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed a transplant ; meanwhile , his body is sentenced to sit still in critical care . 
claussen plunges in a world that it has created all coins , visit places foreigners , journey in time . it sees in old man in a bed sanatorium rail , a robot at his bedside care on her health . 
he lives in the middle ages among the noble that manufacture drugs to basis of blood . 
it is kidnapped by a greek motorbikes which takes him in his country , he surf with his hospital bed in the n√©v√© of the alps and meeting a korean mafia . 
it absorbs completely in this fantasy world , everything is real even later in his memories . 
according to claussen these domestic travel differ fundamentally from any dream . 
the dream is a state quite different , " he writes in describing what he has experienced . 
on the contrary dreams , the memories from the mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later . 
we can even say that they are much more distinctive and more intensive the experience real . 
the intensity of this had been splintered the horizon of our other everyday experiences , according to the psychiatrist schmidt-degenhard . 
ultimately , the delusions oniro√Ødes , psychoses , hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how much our internal representations of external reality are fragile even in a state of eve . 
any change of consciousness , sums up the psychologist kasten " can cause a distortion of what we call reality . " 
an experience that can also be quite enriching . 
the first snow can fall . 
burda 
27 years ago , children will take the continuation of the publishing house . 
the appointment of kallen as ceo of editions burda is an intermediate solution : more long term , hubert burda hope that his two children take up the group of press , he told the newspaper spiegel . 
the holding company must remain 100 % a family business . 
hamburg - has long term , the publisher hubert burda sees his company in the hands of its children 
the two children will inherit to 27 years and are committed to integrate society , said hubert burda , 69 years , spiegel . 
all the details have been settled in advance . 
the question of whether they will be active in the company will arise in the future . 
it will also see if they are capable of . 
we cannot impose its children to 25 employees without whether they have the capacity to deal with it . 
that will blow away a children as well as the company . 
burda had announced last thursday that it was withdrawing from the post pr√©sident-directeur-g√©n√©ral from the months of january and that his successor was paul-bernhard kallen . 
kallen , 52 years , is a member of the board since 1999 . 
it was first responsible for the technology sector . 
subsequently he held the sector treasury that is to say that it was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of j√ºrgen todenh√∂fer he was the head of marketing , the sector foreigner , the impression and finance . 
and for the first time this is not a family member who is the head of editions burda . 
the children of burda respectively 19 and 17 years , his son felix , which would have today 42 years , died a few years ago . 
the nommination of kallen also serves to make the connection of the 10 or 15 years " 
burda specifies that the holding company must remain 100 % between the hands of the family . 
the ruins have always happened in the families who have left lead by a compulsive desire for capital , which have made enormous speculation unfortunate in thinking that they could climb ever higher . 
this has never been my strategy . 
i have never had r√™vede universal power , said burda . 
i am absolutely not in the role of a tutor as could be springer and i do not intend to be part of these international leagues as the time , these companies have taken much too much importance .

zapatero predicts " a future of peace " for the sector of the engine 
the president of the government , jos√© luis rodr√≠guez zapatero , predicts " a future of peace " for the spanish automobile industry which , he said , is the main export sector of the country . 
during the presentation of the economic report of the president of the government for 2009 , zapatero has recalled the measures taken by the executive during the year in order to support the automobile sector . 
" without a plan of competitiveness in the automotive sector , we would now have a landscape of abandonment , closure of some of our main production sites , " said the president of the government .

mazda3 i-stop : a sustainable sporting spirit 
mazda intends to prove that the sporting spirit is not angry with respect for the environment . 
to this end , she has to include on the mazda3 the system of judgment and engine start , called i-stop , a device which , at least for the moment , is available only on the engine 2.0 in essence of 150 horses . 
this second generation of mazda3 be illustrated by the note that it has achieved in its entirety . 
the details , the finishing of the vehicle , the board , the behaviour , the mechanics , the system i-stop ... 
all these aspects are remarkable on the new mazda3 . 
starting with the post of conduct , it turns out that the seats are fronts ergonomics and a setting excellent . 
the touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant . 
by continuing with the whole formed by the picture of control and the games console , we see how mazda has continued in the japanese tendency to create a design of interior futuristic , with many buttons and orders , as well as colorful in red and blue . 
this style reminds us , in part , the honda civic . 
that is why we can say that both the mazda3 that the civic , all two japanese , contrast with the sobriety of german products , and especially with the volkswagen golf , that all want to surpass . 
continuing with the japanese car , this compact presents a habitability more than enough to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort . 
add to this a great boot the forms regular . 
the system of judgment and automatic start-up of the engine , at least for the moment , is available only on the petrol engine of two litres and 150 horses and with change manuel of the six speeds . 
this engine is a true happiness . it is distinguished by its finesse , his low noise , its benefits and the mastery of its consumption . 
indeed , although the mazda3 most requested are the diesel models , those who do not carry out a large number of miles per year should not exclude this i-stop with petrol engine , both for its great comfort of speed that for its consumption under control . 
on the level of equipment , the model chosen for the test is sports , in other words that which has the largest number of elements of series . 
among the series , the assistant to change of direction ( rvm ) , which removes the angle death , controls traction and stability , the regulator of speed , the mirror photosensitive internal , the on-board computer on a screen of great size , the parking sensors , the independent air conditioning , the sensor of rain and light , the bluetooth and the bluetooth audio , as well as the wheels of alignment of 17 inches , are particularly remarkable . 
moreover , as if this equipment was not enough , this version had the pack schedules , which for eur 1 500 more , includes , among other elements of the adaptive headlights bi-x√©non and audio system bose with charger records . 
conclusion 
the mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best tight cars in its class . 
it illustrates in particular by the quality of the materials used , by his behavior and by its level of equipment high . 
in addition , those who are not doing a lot of miles per year will be able to choose the version i-stop associated with only the petrol engine 2.0 150 horses . 
the only drawback of this model is its high price , which lies between 21 770 euros for finishing luxury and 23 eur 270 for the model tested , the sport . 
in return for this important sum , the mazda3 will give us every day a large dose of satisfaction .

the promise of fonpeek 
peek is extremely limited , it is a mechanism which allows only to look at his e-mail , without offering the possibility if only to see certain type of enclosures or surf the internet . 
he tabled its five minutes of fame in the united states , when the magazine the act as one of the products of the year . 
in truth , it is more difficult to see in the street , but the idea seems interesting , especially for young people . 
unlike the smart phones , peek offers a price and a very low monthly subscription , or less than half of what it costs , for example , the subscription data of the iphone . 
given his success , the company has launched two new devices : one designed exclusively for twitter , the other with a free service of data to life , for six times more expensive than the peek . 
fonpeek , presented yesterday at the event the web , is the european version of invention and its third incarnation . 
it is also limited its grand-fr√®re american , but includes a surprise . 
the price of its monthly subscription , around 12 euros , includes the roaming across europe . 
those who travel with a smart phone already know what represents the fact of abandoning the data when you cross a border or desperately seeking a cafeteria on wi-fi ( or a connection of fon ) to check his mail . 
the idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it is a long time that it should operate . 
indeed , some operators have special arrangements and options journey , but for me , i would need to have made a theory in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small print . 
the repeated reminders to the european commission to propose roaming fees affordable in the whole of europe have had a barely perceptible . 
outside their country of origin , people hesitate to use the data , and it was not wrong . 
a small device as the fonpeek ( it is still curious , he is called fon so that it does not have wifi ) offers this type of tariffs , means that operators are starting to think differently and to study various proposals allowing them to make their data network . 
the kindle is another good example , he understands the downloading of books and other research on the internet . 
without subscription and without soup . 
it is a device connected and you pay during its purchase and not every month . 
and that is what i hope to see a day for the fonpeek : an option to purchase with access to life as peek proposes already in the united states . 
not that i want to buy it . 
i look at my mail on my phone , thank you . 
i would simply because i believe that this is a more fair formula for the consumer . 
it would be interesting to see a computer with the same system . 
the favorite color of michelle 
the yellow is , without doubt , the favorite color of the first lady of the united states . 
if it went to the inauguration of barack obama to the presidency of the united states with a dress and a coat of this color , she has , indeed , chosen the same for the match in the second time , without doubt , the most important of his life : the award in oslo the nobel peace prize . 
michelle obama wore a model very similar in these two occasions : in addition to their color ressemblante , drawing a yellow to green with reflections brilliant , both times , the holding consisted of three parts : the dress , the jacket and the coat , in the same tissues , and was adorned with a large embroidery or a collier . 
so a first glance , it would appear that the first lady of the united states follows the wake of the princess of asturias and has chosen to get the same kept . 
but the fabric in which are carved up the two blocs makes them very different . 
if the assumption of office , it was a delicate manoeuvring thick , however , she was in oslo a velvet printed . 
accessories also are different : green shoes to heel way for the first opportunity , and a similar model , but golden , this time . 
hairdressing it , too , has changed : the hair are now met while she was released the last time . 
75 % of working mothers have had problems professionals because of their maternity 
discrimination at work has increased in recent years , especially for women of young people who want to be mothers . 
it is this that reveals the study " fertility and career women in spain , " carried out by the csic in collaboration with the instituto the mujer . 
the inquiry , carried out on 9 737 women of 15 to 75 years , leaves no room for doubt : 75 % of working mothers have seen their career limited because of motherhood . 
the study indicates that there are many differences on the beginning of life as a couple , and the number of children , if the woman is working or not , and the type of employment occupied . 
those who have not of activity outside the home , work part-time work or have a little stable , are earlier in couple , have their first pregnancy sooner and have more children . 
however , women who have a stable job , mainly in the public sector , postpone the entry in life as a couple , and the first pregnancy , and have fewer children . 
women between 35 and 49 years with a fixed work have their first child , on average , 3,7 years after being installed as couples . this figure rises to 4,1 among those who work in the public sector . " these data show that women who have a stable job had need more time in their lives to get it , which has led to the postponement of the union and the arrival of the children . 
in addition , the type of employment exercised influence largely motherhood , but less the starting date of common life , " explains the researcher of csic margarita delgado . 
the level of studies is another factor that widening the gap of the age of marriage of women and their first child . 
according to the survey , the higher the level of training is high , the more they marry and have their first child later . 
the difference is also maintains among women of the same generation . 
for example , in the group have between 35 and 49 years , those who have made studies basic and higher respectively have been mothers for the first time to 25,1 and 32,1 years on average . 
" another disctinction also appears between women , depending on their level of studies . 
while those who have done the basic studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job , those who have done studies of average level or above reverse this programme and give priority to obtaining a stable work as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child , " says mrs delgado . 
diane kruger also is much 
the or√©al paris has just add a new name to its list of ambassadors jalous√©e : diane kruger . 
from next year , the german actress will embody the image of several products of the brand , entonnant the universal currency " because i am worth well . "

a cowardly attack 
last week , my mother , which has about 70 years , was walking in our neighborhood of the city of fuenlabrada , when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent by her side and our dog , a sang-m√©l√© , saved the aps and weighing no more than six pounds , and without saying a word , they assen√®rent two strokes of feet which left the dog seriously injured . 
our outrage is huge because we do not see this as there are fun to attack free of charge a small animal without defence which , in addition , was in leaves . 
add to this the indignation of a woman who was walking calmly and who , when she injuria these individuals , in came to fear for his physical integrity , since a √©nergum√®ne who attack an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman , a child , an old man , or , in short , anyone lower than him . 
the episode came to 17 hours , a tuesday as another , in a neighborhood usually quiet . 
the dog has g√©mi all day . 
of course , we have filed complaints to the police station in the neighborhood , even if we doubt that this serves to much , and not to touch the sensitivities , we just want to say that the cowardly killers were spanish . 
the indignation has led us to denounce this fact . 
we do not understand what is happening among young people for that they are fun to mistreat free a defenceless animal which gives us the affection , friendship and keeps us airline . 
we do not know where is the good education and respect of animals and people . 
michelin and fesvial , sets for wearing helmets 
the michelin tyre manufacturer , in cooperation with the spanish foundation for traffic safety ( fesvial ) , has launched a campaign to encourage wearing helmets , mainly among motorcyclists youngsters , as have announced today the two structures . 
this initiative is intended to raise awareness of the importance of wearing helmets , since it is the only element of protection to prevent injury to the head , or even death , in the event of an accident in two wheels . 
michelin has indicated that this campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety , which " goes beyond the design and manufacture of products always more safe " and said that it contributed to this goal by other actions to educational and informative . 
this new campaign of encouragement to the port of the helmet in two wheels , under the motto " to be but not to be , " will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages of motorcycles , in order to ensure the widest spread . 
finally , michelin has stressed that road safety " is a constant concern " for the company , because as a tyre manufacturer two-wheeled vehicles , one of its main goals is to develop products always safer . 
the sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing 
after almost two years , the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel . 
the 9 425 vehicles registered in november in spain represent an increase of 12,6 % compared to 2008 , and what is more important , they are the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline , according to the figures from the trade union business sectors of manufacturers anfac and ganvam , the dealers . 
however , it should be qualify the good news , since the reference for comparison , the month of november 2008 , has been particularly bad , with a decrease of 60 % compared to the previous year . 
as a result , despite the events of last month , the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40 % below those of the previous year . 
since january , if you add up all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles ( derived from cars , pickup truck , vans , fourgons light and lorries to lightweight chassis ) 95 853 have been sold . 
the big clouds that affect the more their demand have not provided dispelled . indeed , although they are also bought by individuals , most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises , who pay in almost 100 % of cases thanks to an external funding . 
thus , in more restrictions involved by limiting the bank lending , we need to add other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation . 
faced with this situation , and unlike cars , aid to the purchase of the 2000e have little used . 
in addition to the individuals , the self-employed and small businesses who want to acquire a commercial vehicle slight less 3,5 tonnes with a level of co2 emissions which does not exceed the 160 grams per kilometre , can also benefit from it , but the number of operations speaks for itself . 
yesterday , among ganvam , we recalled again the need for the administration to attach attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles ( lorries and buses ) . 
the association of dealers provides a year 2010 similar to that which ends , for which it calculates a drop in sales ( for passenger cars and 4x4s ) of 19 % . 
the emergency braking is now obligatory 
as has occurred with the system anti-lock brakes abs and , as this will take place with the esp stability control , the braking systems of emergency will be a mandatory part on european cars . 
they are already mandatory in cars of tourism and light commercial vehicles , while newly registered for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been set until the end of february 2011 . 
the measure , imposed by the european union , is intended to strengthen the protection of pedestrians , even if , by his mode of action , it can also help prevent many rear shocks . 
the assistant emergency braking is increasing the pressure on the brakes in emergency cases detected by the system through kicked given by the driver . 
but it does not always keeps the pressure until the end . 
according to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars bosch , a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to rely on the brake before the collision , and half of them had not benefited from its full force . 
up to 1 100 accidents 
the intervention of aid , revancha , requires the most of the brake system , reducing the distance that the car needs to stop . 
according to a study of the eu , if all cars were equipped with this type of elements , until 1 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be prevented each year . 
this reduction would be even more important with popularizing of the so-called intelligent systems emergency braking : we calculate that a sinister on four with injuries would be avoided . 
in this case , the vehicle is equipped with a system which , thanks to a radar or a camera detects the obstacles and warns the driver , in addition to act slightly on the brakes . 
if the driver reacts , it aid by increasing the pressure on the pedal , if that is necessary . 
if it does not act , and although the collision is inevitable , the device is the maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimise the damage . 
general motors postponed until january the plan for opel 
while workers at opel 's figueruelas plant ( zaragoza ) have been warned by nick reilly , the new president of general motors ( gm ) europe , that the production of the new meriva model would be launched during the first week of april - probably the 8 - , according to javier ortega , the north american manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the rescue of opel .
