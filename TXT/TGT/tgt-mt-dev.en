surgeons in los angeles have said that they were outraged , said mr camus . 
i heard about a possible judicial procedure to come , he said . 
jean-claude camus has estimated that johnny hallyday was " party far too fast for los angeles , with the permission of the parisian surgeon . " 
i had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and i was amazed , given that i myself had two hernies discales , he added . 
a little earlier on rtl , he had indicated that the singer was apparently " party without drain , nothing , " after his operation in paris . 
dr stéphane delajoux is very experienced in the middle of art . 
he had made the actress marie trintignant in vilnius , a few days before his death , in a clinic of neuilly-sur-seine where he was at the time . 
in 2007 , it had also made the actress charlotte gainsbourg to reduce a hématome following a brain hemorrhage . 
but it is also a doctor to the reputation sulfureuse , repeatedly condemned by justice , in cases of medical liability , as well as for tax evasion and fraud . 
olivier metzner me , the lawyer of the order of doctors , has been accused of being " a man without scruples " continued " regularly " before the council of the next , and who is " far from being appropriate . " 
after several days of silence , dr. stéphane delajoux spoke friday through his lawyer , david koubbi . 
it has indicated that the speech was " quite well " and that the tests post-opératoires were " normal " . 
the operation " was not hemorrhagic and was therefore not the laying of a drain , " he added . 
in any event , the tour of the singer , whose troubles for health are multiplying since this summer , seems aside . 
obviously , a resumption of the tour on 8 january ( in amiens , ndlr ) as expected , it seems very short , said mr camus . 
the association udf tone and increase the amount the new centre not to use its acronym 
the association udf , controlled by the modem françois bayrou , responded friday to the takeover attempt of the president of the new centre , hervé morin , the acronym of the ex-parti giscardien , putting it in remains not to use it on any support , under pain of prosecution . 
hervé morin has publicly announced its intention to recover the acronym udf , ruling that françois bayrou does not deserve to defend his legacy policy after having reached out to the left . 
the defence minister , whose party is a partner of the ump , had also planned to confirm this strategy on saturday before the national council of the nc . 
to support its approach , it has received the support of the member hervé de charette ( ex-ump happened in nc ) which claims ownership of the brand udf to have been the first to the table in 2004 at the national institute of industrial property . 
but on friday evening , the office of the association udf , controlled by the friends of françois bayrou who do not intend to let themselves be deprived , is out of his silence to launch a formal notice to the minister and member , summoning the no longer use the acronym and convey to them the property of the brand , under pain of prosecution . 
you have multiplied , these days , the statements indicating that you were going to offer your political movement of + resume + the acronym udf , writing the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau , including françois bayrou and marielle de sarnez the modem , as senator jean arthuis of the alliance centrist . 
you also believed to follow up on your militant material and on page of care of your site , the name of this movement , the + new centre + , the slogan + the udf today + , also see the signatories of the letter . 
as you know , you have no right to the use of this symbol , explains the office of the udf that remains the nc to withdraw " immediately the mention of the name of the udf all support as well as ( its ) website " . 
it also asks hervé de charette " to convey the property of ( the ) marks to its rightful copyright holders . " 
if you were not , the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of adherents of the udf , prevent the signatories . 
in their letter they stipulate that the udf " is a fully-fledged political movement since 1978 " and recalling that mr morin and his friends had " made the choice " of leaving in 2007 " to create a movement competitor , as others had done in 2002 , to create the ump . " 
the new centre does so , according to them , no right to use the acronym udf ( union for french democracy ) . 
they also recall that the last congress of the udf voted in 2007 its accession to the modem for three years and the creation of an office responsible for defending " the material and moral interests " of the training founded by valéry giscard d 'estaing . 
as for hervé de charette , pursues the office , " when it has tabled the brand , " he was " more adhering to the udf for three years , " but the ump . 
it benefits scandalously and fraudulently the abscence depositing the acronym for the udf carry out to his account . 
this inappropriate is turning into crime , dénoncent-ils , before to mock , on the strategy of the nc : " it seems to us that in politics , as in life , it is more worthy to make a name for yourself to try to get out of the anonymity by taking fraudulently a name which has not law . " 
case liliane bettencourt : françois-marie banier will be judged for abuse of weakness 
the court in nanterre decided friday to judge the artist françois-marie banier to determine if , as in accuses the daughter of the billionaire liliane bettencourt , it has taken advantage of a state of weakness of the 80-year-old for the plunder of part of his fortune . 
the photographer of 62 years , known for his photographs of stars , will be judged on 15 and 16 april 2010 for abuse of weakness , a criminal offence to a maximum penalty of three years in prison and 375.000 euros fine . 
this decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families of france , in which a mother and daughter are squabbling with each other while taking the reins of the empire of cosmetics the oréal . 
but the 15th house alleged has also ordered that a medical expertise of liliane bettencourt , aged 87 , should be waged collectively by three doctors . 
heir and main shareholder of the oréal has always refused to submit to such a review , at least not in the terms offered by the public prosecutor of nanterre during the investigation . 
doctors appointed on friday will issue a report before 10 march 2010 by saying especially if liliane bettencourt was able to find in a state of weakness and what periods . 
i think it will . 
i am going to talk , said at the exit of the hearing mrs bettencourt 's lawyer , georges kiejman . 
for its part , the lawyer of françoise bettencourt-meyers , olivier metzner , welcomed the decision of the court . 
this is excellent news ( ... ) the expertise will show that he ( mr banier ) has manipulated this elderly lady that we must protect , he said . 
for two years , the single girl liliane bettencourt has engaged in criminal proceedings against françois-marie banier , photographer and touche-à-tout artist , which it accuses of having benefited for years from the weakness of his mother to obtain a billion euros of donations , in the form of cheques , life insurance contracts or paintings of masters . 
for its part , liliane bettencourt has always refuted have been manipulated by the photographer , which it regards as a longstanding friend . 
while the court should examine the admissibility of the action taken by mrs bettencourt-meyers , the pleadings lawyers have sometimes turned to large family display friday . 
thus , the lawyer of liliane bettencourt reported three letters sent by his client ( in 1999 , 2003 and 2005 ) to his notary , in which she said beware the husband of françoise bettencourt-meyers . 
in the letter dated 2003 liliane bettencourt added , according to the lawyer : " could you explain to my daughter that i wrote to banier once , twice a day for 15 years . 
françoise , i have never been able to speak to him since his marriage " . 
for its part , the public prosecutor of nanterre has again estimated that the complainant was not admissible to act as a judge of the supervisory authorities refused these last few days with its request to open a process of judicial protection for his mother . 
liliane bettencourt " has full capacity to act , it is not under protection and has no sponsor . 
nobody else has to act in his place , " said the representative of the public prosecutor , marie-chrsitine daubigney . 
the tribunal has finally decided that it is consulted once the trial will take place on the admissibility of mrs bettencourt-meyers . 
managerial revolution or end of economic intelligence ? 
if nothing changes in the governance of big french companies , our struggle for the development of the economic intelligence will have been in vain ... 
for more than a decade , the attitude of the management of large companies toward its employees , recalls the position of the companies toward consumers before the revolution marketing : it is about to join the staff to " values " determined to high as they once were , to impose the consumer products invented by the technicians of the factory . 
by putting the customer at the heart of the company , the marketing revolution has called the strategies of conquest of markets to the place ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected factors of clienteles preferences of back regularly ! 
a demobilisation of employees can lead to a deadly demoralisation . 
suicides at france telecom , psa and renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon which particularly affects the frameworks . 
this demobilization seriously undermining the development of all intellectual functions of the company , including r & d and , even more , the intelligence economic . 
indeed , ie " requires all the stakeholders ( ... ) a pro-active and a forward-looking vision " ; it requires the part of employees a commitment that the revenue management bedevil authoritarian completely . 
that is why we are calling for a revolution managerial skills to set the staff at the centre of the company in the same way that the customer . 
the usefulness of any internal surveys 
opinion polls -comme internal the questionnaire submitted by orange to its salariés- will encourage this revolution in the practices managériales ? 
unfortunately , i fear not . 
- firstly because i saw that , faced with a new situation , any structure is eventually , after detours , primarily ... what it has always done . ! 
- then , because authoritarianism -une pathologies of pouvoir- grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures . 
- finally , because most of the leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior . 
from the great engineering schools , they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology . 
they adopt , by intellectual comfort , the old theory behavioriste , cranked up recently by the " neuroscience " american and widely distributed , unbeknownst to them , by the institutes of studies and the media . 
thus , suggesting that it is possible to handle the " levers " ( sic ) of the commitment of executives , a recent survey of ipsos appeared in the figaro.fr it reinforces the leaders in a posture of governance , mechanistic unsuited to the world today . 
identify and measure the factors of mobilisation 
on the contrary , the revolution managerial skills necessary to the proper functioning of the modern companies , suppose to adopt a final vision of human behavior . 
it is to incorporate in any reasoning or practice of governance , a fundamental observation : for employees , the commitment to the company is only possible if it is clear as a means of achieving a part of their dreams , their ambitions , of their projects . 
currently , only the studies from the analysis motifonctionnelle adopt this design of the motives of the employees . 
these studies have shown that they consider their company based on a predetermined ideology that allows them , through their image seen of the company , to assess what it offers them to achieve their life plans . 
thanks to the identification and to the extent these factors of mobilisation , business leaders can control , predict and anticipate their " social performance " and put their management of human resources " to the place . " 
they create a breeding ground for development of a concerted economic intelligence robust and effective . 
oslo speech : " just war " is worth of praise to right to obama 
the american right has welcomed friday the speech the eve in oslo by barack obama , pleased that the nobel peace prize 2009 has defended the concept of " just war " against the enemies of the united states . 
the conservatives , who had brocardé awarding the prize to mr obama on 9 october , applauded this time the speech , like sarah palin , former vice-presidential candidate in the 2008 elections . 
i liked what he said , said mrs palin , heroine of the right wing of the republican party in the usa today newspaper , adding having itself addressed the subject of the war " sometimes necessary " in his memoirs that have just been published . 
the war is , of course , the last thing in my opinion that the americans want to have to do , but it is necessary . 
we must stop these terrorists everything out there , it has estimated . 
mr obama , who has inherited the two wars of his predecessor george w. bush in iraq and afghanistan , has used thursday to oslo to justify the use of force , a way to explain his decision to send additional troops to afghanistan 30.000 nine days earlier . 
another opponent of mr obama , newt gingrich , has estimated that the president had done to oslo " a very good job . " 
i found that the speech was really very well , welcomed the former chairman of the house of representatives , which has especially liked the reference to " the existence of evil in the world " in the presidential words . 
by some hand , i found this speech quite historic , said mr gingrich , questioned during the radio programme " the takeaway . " 
the former elected , regarded by some as a possible candidate for the republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election , has said it is pleased to have seen " a president left " remind members of the nobel committee " that they would not be free and could not put a price of peace if the use of force did not exist . " 
for michael gerson pen , former george w. bush handed over to the washington post columnist , mr obama gave a speech " very american . " 
in addition to present themselves in " citizen of the world " as " he always does , " " he spoke as an american president , " reminding the european " that they live in a bubble of security that they have not created , and they do not do much to preserve it , " said mr gerson . 
among the few right not to be convinced , a falcon to the bush era , the former ambassador to the united nations john bolton , has called the speech " dull , spouted and without inspiration " on the site national review online . 
has the left of the president , the democratic representative dennis kucinich has alarmed to see barack obama justify the use of force . 
when we wraps the war in the notion of justice , we can easily justify the killing of innocent people , he warned . 
the press centre-left glowing , however , remained in the place of the president . 
the los angeles times , while continuing to think that the nobel was awarded prematurely to mr obama , has described his speech " superproduction " even for a speaker known for his talent . 
the speech of oslo " should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflicts , poverty and oppression , " has reignited the californian daily . 
mr obama " gave the speech that " we need , has estimated the new york times , deeming it " both dark and edifying . " 
drivers : three marathons for an agreement that saves the supplies of christmas 
after three sessions of négociations-marathon , unions of the road sector and tlf , only employers organisation to be stayed until the end , arrived friday night in an agreement that puts an end to the strike and the threat to the supply of christmas . 
in the sitting signatures on friday evening , the secretary of state for transport , dominique bussereau , is " pleased " of this agreement , after several sessions of negotiations , launched on wednesday morning . 
after a second night of discussions the negotiators were left in the morning on friday , with the hope of signing quickly by the end of the morning the text of the agreement . 
and even if three employers ( fntr , unostra , otre ) had slammed the door . 
but it took more than six hours of a meeting began at 11 a. m so that everyone agrees and 6 to the text was signed . 
the conflict " would have been very damaging for businesses " and " it was feared that it vienna disrupt the holiday season , " said mr bussereau . 
the text provides a wage increases of 4 % for the lowest wages ( in the local and regional road transport ) , and 2,9 % for the highest ( international transport ) . 
in hourly rate for the bas-salaires , " you go from 8,72 eur 9,06 . 
it 's not a big thing , but we are very far , said patrice closed ( fo ) . 
this or we will give the order to our activists that there are no blockages , not blockade of refuelling centres . 
but we can always have a few that are not happy , he added . 
philippe grillot , president of tlf , welcomed " a good agreement , " even though it was " difficult to concede the increases on the top earners given international competition . " 
according to him , the increases will be of the order of 170 euros for the monthly low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest . 
that is the agreement of common sense and the respect of employees , said maxim dumont ( cfdt ) , while thierry douine ( cftc ) has welcomed a " historic agreement . " 
richard jaubert ( cgt ) has raised " a compromise acceptable . " 
the agreement also provides for the upgrading of travel costs of 3 % , and the holding of general state of road transport in the first half of 2010 , which will allow us to address the issue of a 13th months and modernisation of the collective bargaining agreement . 
mr bussereau has reminded us that " a drop of 100 million euros in employer contributions " has been the subject of a government amendment to the bill of amending finances for 2009 , voted thursday night on friday by the national assembly . 
the government will ask the senate to vote " in the same term . " 
the signing of tlf allows the agreement applies in a prime time to businesses adhérentes this organization , and in a second time , to the whole profession , in the case of extension by the minister of labour . 
it will be , " as soon as possible , " assured mr bussereau . 
the opposition of employers can only delay the process . 
the fntr has denounced a " fool , " because the 100 million euros " had already been promised the sector to compensate for some of the carbon tax . " 
the secretary of state for transport has forced to negotiate in the urgency , not in conclusion of a shared analysis , but not to thwart the next eaters turkey store , has deplored the unostra . 
for the otre , the agreement risk " digging the grave of a very large number of smes in the sector in the next 12 months . "

the interconnection with sncf will be suspended at nanterre prefecture , which will force passengers to change train . 
the galleries lafayette , who expect 200.000 clients every day , were happy the fact that " the ratp made efforts to serve the big shops . " 
the rer has crosses from west to east agglomeration of paris . 
the ratp stretch short of nanterre saint-germain-en-laye and to boissy-saint-léger and marne-la-vallée .

and in the morning , the station of saint-germain-en-laye ( yvelines ) was much less crowded than usual , for example , in the absence of middle school students and high school students . 
has boissy-saint-léger ( val-de-marne ) , jack nbakina , engineer of 29 years , explained to be lifted " half an hour earlier , to be sure to arrive at the time . " 
the station saint-lazare has not undergone saturation , has indicated the sncf , which had planned a framework of officials and security forces .

the turkish courts dissolved the pro-kurdish decision with serious consequences 
the turkish constitutional court said friday the dissolution of the main pro-kurdish party in the country , a decision which was immediately followed by demonstrations of anger in the kurdish community , in the south-east of the country and istanbul . 
this decision could greatly complicate the task of the government , which has just reach out to the kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict . 
the democratic society party ( dtp ) was dissolved because it had become a " home of activities prejudicial to the independence of the state and to its unity indivisible , " said the press the president of the court hasim kiliç , at the end of four days of deliberations . 
the decision was taken to the unanimity of the 11 judges , while a qualified majority of seven was required to give the dissolution , said mr kiliç , adding that 37 senior party , including its president ahmet türk and the member aysel tugluk , are banned from politics for five years . 
the judge also announced the closure of the parliamentary immunity had enjoyed türk mr and mrs tugluk by the treasury and the confiscation of assets in the party . 
the dtp has 21 seats in parliament ( on 550 ) . 
its leaders had warned before the verdict that members leave parliament rather than sit as members without label . 
the decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the court of cassation abdurrahman yalçinkaya , which accuses the dtp to obey the " guidelines " of the kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) , considered a terrorist organisation by ankara and many countries . 
many observers believe that the dtp is the showcase legal policy rebels of the pkk . 
the party holds , however , that it has " no organic " links with the pkk but refuses to describe this terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with him . 
the court 's verdict comes at a time when the government has to reach out to the kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights , to try to stem the support of the kurds to the pkk and put an end to the conflict . 
the leaders of the dtp had said that a dissolution could lead to an escalation of tension in the south-east anatolian , where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the pkk leader abdullah öcalan degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks . 
when the news of justice , a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the dtp in diyarbakir , the main city in the south-east populated by majority of kurds . 
the police fired tear-gas grenades and used water cannon , while protesters throwing molotov cocktails or stones , with insurrections . 
a hundred people protested also in istanbul . 
after the verdict , mr türk said that the decision of the justice system was " deepening despair . " 
turkey cannot resolve this issue ( kurdish , ndlr ) by banning a party , he said in the press . 
the government , formed by a party from the islamist movement , has also deplored the decision . 
we are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties . 
it solves nothing , said minister of energy taner yildiz . 
this decision is a total torpedoing the democratic opening launched by the government , said political analyst ahmet insel . 
one can expect , of course , a reaction of the pkk , he added . 
on thursday , the pkk has claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of turkey , one of the deadliest of these last few months . 
the first snow can fall 
what would wolfgang brauburger , it is a winter of rigorous . 
but the head of the service of spadework and sablage roads ( fes ) makes it clear that this is not to annoy the citizens . 
it is simply that the agents can test the technique of vehicles and learn to control them . 
and after the métérologues , it could well be for this weekend . 
more than 300 agents and 120 vehicles is ready to tackle the snow and ice . 
the fes follows a very elaborate plan . 
mr brauburger explains that as soon as it starts to neiger on the city of frankfurt and that temperatures down below zero , large vehicles of sablage travel 20 main routes used ( so-called routes has ) . 
this includes the streets to great movement , the main arteries , as the neue weg and hanauer landstraße . 
are also included the access firefighters , the routes of public transport , the walkability and streets in slope like the atzelbergstraße . 
the agents of fes start their service to three hours of the morning . 
in times of need , the no 1040 miles of roads must be salt with a road basis which adheres well , in 3 hours maximum . 
that is why the service of fes starts at 3h in the morning " so that the roads to be released when starts the trafficking of daily migration . " 
where it gets more difficult , it is when the snow starts to fall à7h30 in the morning . 
this causes problems , says the head of the service of spadework and sablage roads " because no driver is prepared to miss the salting vehicles . " 
then , if it does more snow , we access routes and roads of servicing - as the rat-beil-straße . 
the sidings and streets latérales come last . 
mr brauburger knows that it is always a few complaints . 
has five hours of the morning , the team 's pedestrian fes gets in the way to reach in priority areas deemed dangerous and the passages . 
about the bike lanes , the services of fes usually do not deal with it . 
mr brauburger specify that there is a special service in frankfurt is responsible to monitor the state bridges between 22 hours and 4 . 30 . 
as the ice to form very quickly on these surfaces , the vehicles of intervening salting as soon as the temperature falls below 2 degrees . 
it also happens that the police to appeal to this special service snack of need . 
the cradle of dinosaurs 
the tawa hallae looked like the other carnivorous dinosaurs : this upright was about 2 feet long for 1,50m high , after its members were powerful , his skull lying was provided teeth acérées recourbées , his short arms and third countries were coming to an end by claws in sickle and he had a long tail . 
if this species had lived a few million years later , it would not have been exceptional . 
but , as reports sertling nesbitt of the university of texas in austin and his colleagues in the journal science on thursday , the tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs containing the morpho-functional characteristics . 
this animal lived 215 million years ago in new mexico who faisaità the time part land masses of supercontinent , the pangea and was to the equator . 
sertling nesbitt said that the discovery of tawa sheds a new light the evolution of the first dinosaurs . 
indeed , it tells us the ties of kin , the distribution and characteristics of the latter . 
it is in 2006 that sertling nesbitt has undertaken searches in the company of other these paleontologists , on the site of gohst ranch in northern new mexico 
randall irmis of the natural history museum in utah and a member of the team searches tells it happens sometimes find a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a layer sédimentaire dating from the trias . 
scientists have very soon realised that a portion of these bones belonged to a new species . 
the surveys have updated the remains of five specimens . 
a discovery that confirms the theories about the beginnings of dinosaur evolution . 
researchers have dubbed it the name of tawa after the word of the indians hopi people for the god of the sun . 
for sterling nesbitt , it is a quite exceptional discovery : the fossils of dinosaurs from the trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of bone incomplete . 
all the experts in paleontology do not share this enthusiasm . 
for example , martin sander of the university of bonn does not find that this discovery is particularly dramatic , it says , however , that it enables us to confirm some theories about the beginnings of dinosaur evolution . 
according to the current state of knowledge , the dinosaurs have emerged on earth there is about 230 million years ago . 
most fossil of the older , however , are fragmented and incomplete which makes it very difficult the classification of all first dinosaurs . 
the experts are wondering , among other things , to what time the sauriens were divided into three groups of major developments : the théropodes ( carnivores ) who understand the t. rex and the velociraptor emerged later and whose down the birds , the sauropodes quadrupedal animals , the long neck , and those who are related and the herbivores ornithischiens including the species such as the triceratops and stégosaure . 
according to the studies of s. nesbitt and his colleagues , tawa is one of the first théropodes . 
this species to present a report interesting features both primitive and developed , said s. nesbitt . 
researchers have found signs that suggest that the tawa hallae possèdait small air bags in his bones in the skull , just as the birds that are the descendants of théropodes . 
these small pockets of air facilitate the breath of birds compared to mammals . 
it seems that in the tawa hallae , the vertebrae have also been partially met air . 
according to randall irmis , the tawa is one of the oldest théropodes with small air bags in its bones . 
as the lines related the immense sauropodes owned also air bags and a backbone slight , we can assume that they already had a common ancestor of this innovation beneficial . 
three successive waves of migration to north america . 
as the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in south america , researchers have concluded that the sauriens were reported there . 
consequently , the three major lineages of evolution are divided and have spread from south america to the rest of the world that is to say the whole land masses who formed the supercontinent pangea . 
this seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of these paleontologists has also found the remains of two other théropodes which are not particularly related . 
the three species can disembark from a common ancestor would have migrated , say researchers . 
alan turner of the natural history museum in new york and co-author of the journal science studies said that there would have been at least three waves of migration to north america . 
of course there are a few inconsistencies . 
martin sander , paleontologist in bonn said that there is a species even more , the former silesaure , who lived in poland which belongs to a group related to dinosaurs . 
according to him it may give a mistaken view because there is in south america a large number of fossils of dinosaurs that have been preserved so that there is virtually no on other continents . 
by contrast , how dinosaurs are they managed to become the dominant tétrapodes of the secondary era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line the branch of reptiles , is still a mystery . 
at the time of the trias , dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles , such as with ancestors of present-day crocodiles and with many other sauriens . 
towards the end of the trias dinosaurs are spread over the entire planet , thereby promoting the development of many new species while others who were related , have disappeared between the trias and the jurassic . 
such a success , however , is not eternal . 
to explain this transformation , martin sander sees two hypotheses . 
there may have been a mass extinction to which the dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles have disappeared . 
or so , the dinosaurs were better suited and they have therefore been able to eliminate the competition on the ground . 
in any case , such a success is not eternal . 
150 million years later , the fall of a meteorite favorisal' development of a group of animals that had also developed during the trias and since that time essentially in the shadows : it was mammals . 
the solidarity of vienna in sao paulo 
the list is long and there are signatories of the world . 
there are those of professors from the university of toronto , of the university of cambridge , the university of vienna , or berkeley in california .

last week , the president of the university werner müller-estler did evacuate buildings occupied by students and teachers in grèveaprès that walls and works of art have been daubed with graffiti . 
five students were injured during the evacuation . 
the signatories believe the damage did not justify " a violent also intervention from the commando police against students and teachers who had held their own progress . " 
the evacuation represents an " unacceptable breach " to freedom of research and education . 
the fact of focus exclusively on the acts of vandalism serves only to " delegitimise and criminalise the protest " and tries to forget the reasons for the mobilisation . 
the steering committee of the university is taken out of the debates that would be needed . 
lecturers are demanding that the criminal prosecution to be suspended immediately . 
the majority of the occupiers has not taken part in the degradation . 
legitimacy of protests

we understand the sense of protests but do not accept vandalism , has expressed the cdu member of the regional parliament peter beuth . 
the groups of the opposition party , the greens and the left ( the left ) did not share that opinion . 
the csu takes the pretext of a few walls peinturlurés to criminalise the protests , said janine wissler party of the left ( left ) 
instead of thinking about arguments and demands of students , shrugs off . 
the party of the left has tabled a motion which , after the minister of the interior to submit a report on the conditions of the intervention of the police . 
the new " silicon-valley " 
for a long time she had the reputation of city secret , banned the western visitors . 
zelenograd , one of the ten districts of moscow , was under the soviet regime , a place of research of the secret weapons , under strict supervision . 
today , with its 216 000 people to 37 miles from the center of moscow , the municipality has the reputation of being the " silicon valley soviet " . 
important places of production and research into micro and nanoélectronique are implanted . 
as of september 2008 representatives of zelenograd created links with riedberg , place of science mehr - with university institutes and societies in the centre of innovations in frankfurt ( fiz ) .

in 2010 , representatives of the fiz and smes , whose strong point is scientific research , will zelenograd for a seminar . 
scientific echange 
it is a scientific exchange sustainable . 
but also economic relations . 
it will allow the company to fiz into the russian market . 
unlike scientific societies russians want to obtain contracts in germany . 
zelenograd is the seat of institutions and companies soviet research famous . 
there is the institute of electrical engineering in moscow , the big firms sitronics and rosssijskaja-elektronika . 
the community was founded in 1958 as " socialist planned city " for research in weapons . 
zelenograd ( literal translation " green city " ) takes its name wooded hills in the heart which research centres are implanted . 
the project s21 : a brake for stuttgart 
we cannot put high enough the scale of the project stuttgart 21 . 
for its supporters , it is nothing less than " new heart of europe . " 
if you want . s21 , it is much more than the burial of a railway station , more than a massive construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of baden-württemberg , in a despairing chaos of yards for a decade . 
stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 1980s . 
the stations front line , with approaches that third countries were coming to an end in full city , had a reputation at the time to be the relics of the technique of transport in the 19th century that were effect of sabot brake modern rail traffic because it was once a lot of time to get the engine of the back to the front . 
arrival , ruling the short , departure - that is what he should do . 
that is why the stations front line must disappear : in frankfurt and munich . 
and in stuttgart , too : a station of passing trains , which is half-way around on the rail trans-european between paris and budapest / bratislava where the slogan " heart of europe . " 
the project s21 will really begin , although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible to reality . 
even the most ambitious planners have acknowledged that the cost , to bury the station in the respective capitals of hesse and bavaria , was exorbitant . 
indeed , the stations front line are really more problems for the entry and exit since there are modern trains , reversible with autorails and voiture-pilote at both ends . 
however it is now launching the achievement of stuttgart 21 next to the new route of the inter-city line towards ulm . 
the policies regional and municipal prevailed . 
the company of the railways is in part because it is the taxpayer who made the costs of the risks of biggest infrastructure project of the federal republic and not the public . 
from the point of view town-planning this project is relatively well justified . 
you get a urban space which - according to the graphs planners generated by computer - will be very . 
for the system of rail transport the s21 is harmful . 
the station of passage and the enlargement of the section are designed for a traffic people which allowed - and that is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth . 
then there is still not competition cheap flights . 
the policy of the modern traffic should first focus on strengthening freight traffic because transport by rail is much more environmentally friendly as by truck on the road . 
but the new route , with its inclinaisons , is not to freight trains . 
the s21 , and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects . 
for example , six billion euros will be swallowed up in the draft of the swabian . 
this is the official figure . 
experts believe that 10 to 15 billion is more realistic . 
one thing is for sure , in the next decade the money involved for other points of interface and congestion in the network . 
the list of the ministry of transport mentions in any sixty large projects . 
one of the most important is the enlargement of the section through the rhine valley of 180 good kilometres . 
since 1987 the line is built in slow motion . 
it would be really urgent to support here in the substance of the fungus . 
but the project s21 fact the effect of a sabot braking . 
the route of the rhine valley is becoming the bottleneck freight traffic international , and this in the heart of europe . 
the government is considering the judgment on the airport 
the regional parliament of wiesbaden , the national government has raised the possibility of appeal to the judgement of the administrative court of hesse on the ban of air flights at night . 
the minister of economics dieter posch ( fdp ) has announced that the coalition cdu / fdp had entrusted experts to examine from a legal point of view the ruling by the administrative court and which is a document containing more than 400 pages . 
the court of kassel justified in a written document that the land should adapt the regulation on the ban of night flights in the case or the construction of the track to aterrissage north-west of frankfurt airport would be fulfilled . 
the authorisation of attérir for 17 aircraft between 23 : and five in the morning , as envisaged by the national government , is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against the night air pollution . 
the coalition must have decided for january 4 , if it wants to make an appeals process against the ruling . 
the opposition criticism this deadline and trying to put pressure on the government representative for celui-cirenonce the appeal of the federal administrative court of leipzig . 
the head of the parliamentary group spd torsten schäfer-gümbel invite the cdu and the fdp to return to their promise made before the election , and was to ban night flights . otherwise , it will be condidéré as a breach total to a word . 
it is so damned hard to be allowed to keep its word , said the leader of the greens tariq al-wazir alluding to the fdp éléctoral slogan " we keep our promises . " 
the minister dieter posch refute accusations of schäfer-gümbel which claims that the national government is trying to allow when even the night flights using " avocasserie and roublardises . " 
it takes time to make a precise legal review . 
the coalition does not want to take a decision on the basis of a " rapid first impression . " 
it must be that the decision is legally reliable , said stefan müller ( fdp ) . 
the interpretation of the opposition on the statements of his fraction on the ban of night flights is completely érronée . 
us banks repay the aid 
the big us banks , very affected by the crisis , have taken away from their ties to the state . 
the bank of america announced wednesday that it had repaid in full at the treasury $ 45 billion ( more than 30 billion euros ) , equivalent to aid in the framework of the tarp bailout plan . 
the chain of american television cnbc indicated in a report that citigroup also envisaged repay aid received . 
the banking institutions seek to get rid of the restrictions , which accompanied the acceptance of the are , as for example the limitation of bonuses awarded to leader as well as the regulation of higher charges . 
bank of america has launched a capital increase by the sale of securities from investors who told him 19 billion dollars of fresh money . 
the rest of the money comes from the coffers of the bank that are well met thanks to the sale of several branches of other sectors . 
last wednesday evening , kenneth lewis , the director general of the bank of america has kept expressly to thank the american taxpayers : the injection of capital greatly helped to overcome a difficult period . 
the banking institution had assumed its capabilities in buying the investment bank merrill lynch at the height of the financial turmoil . 
the citigroup is also considering raise money on the financial markets to free themselves from the state . 
the american bank could launch as early as thursday , a capital increase of 20 billion dollars , reported the chain cnbc quoting banking circles . 
the spokesman for citigroup did not wish to comment on this information . 
in june the banks goldman sachs , jp morgan chase and morgan stanley had repaid the public funds that they had received . 
election accelerated 
ultimately , it is when even spent more quickly than expected . 
just two weeks after the purge of the current taking the post of chief redacteur nikolaus brender by the board of the german chain zdf , the successor is already appointed . 
the commission wanted to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment . 
peter frey , who runs the drafting berlin zdf was the big favorite . 
the chain has not wanted to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure . 
however , it seems that there was also the desire not to further undermine steward of the zdf markus schächter in case the proposal would not be accepted by the board . 
frey , who is the candidate of schächter , had need the vote of nine members of the committee on 14 . 
the outcome of the vote was not yet known to the closing of the drafting of this edition . 
two weeks ago , schächter had proposed to the board of five-year extension of the contract of nikolaus brender but this was rejected . 
only 7 council members were in favour of the renewal of brender and 7 others had voted against . the impeachment by vote of brender represented a failure although predictable for schächter . 
indeed , the cdu majority on the board had already suggested several weeks before the vote , not wanting to renew brender to his post . 
it is roland koch , the prime minister of the land of hesse , who had organised a league against the editor . 
he had refused the contract of the esteemed redacteur in chief is extended , citing the fact that the rate of listening to the emissions of information from the zdf had fallen under brender . 
that is why the protests were still taking place , almost until the vote , lashing out at the growing political influence exerted on the zdf . 
at the end there was even 35 experts in public law who had intruded in the debate and who believed that the action of koch was unconstitutional . 
but this is for nothing . 
peter frey : who is it ? 
peter frey was born on 4 august 1957 to bingen . 
he has studied the sciences-politiques , the pedagogy etles romance languages ( spanish ) . 
he then worked at südwestfunk ( radio body of rhineland-palatinate ) and the german daily frankfurter rundschau ( national ) . 
in 1983 he becomes editor in the zdf first in news magazine " heute-journal " ( paper today ) . 
then its journey continues : from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy rédacteur-en-chef then ; then corresponding to washington in 1991 / 1992 , then , and until 1998 he was head and presenter of " morgenmagazins " ( emission of fortnightly information presented the morning ) ; until 2001 he was responsible for the service of foreign policy of the zdf then head of the berlin drafting . 
after the disgrace of brender , when it had just been elected journalist of the year by the journal medium magazin specialist , the greens have announced that they laid down a constitutional complaint 
the enemy of koch on the board , the prime minister of rhineland-palatinate kurt beck , said last week that the länder should transform the intergovernmental treaty of the zdf so that the proposals to staff of steward cannot be blocked by a political majority biased . 
however , beck has no plans to ask for the withdrawal of politicians members of the committees for monitoring the zdf . 
peter frey , the likely successor to brender had manoeuvred cleverly to the council of administration vehemently criticising the commission in its decision to sack brender . 
thanks to this show of independence journalistic schächter was able to propose for the post of rédacteur-en-chef without losing face , even as the board could elect without the soupconne to put in the post a supporter policy . 
in the representations arithmetic of parties , frey is classified , liberal left . 
cleansing in university studies 
partial success for students : after a year of educational strike the ministers of education and cultural affairs länder decide to be more accommodating : at a meeting between ministers and the delegates of the conference of vice-chancellors , an agreement has been developed stating that the working conditions of students bachelor and masters had to be improved . 
in the future , students should be able to overcome their studies . 
they are particularly agreed to reduce the weight of the examinations : a single review should allow us to close the module of study chosen . 
in addition , the burden of work will have to be reconsidée to ensure " realistic proportions and acceptable . " 
the political authorities and higher education institutions want to facilitate the recognition of exams between universities and abroad . 
the states are also committed to hold joint structural requirements more flexible for the smuggling of bachelor and masters . 
at the regional level , there should be no different regulation of a land to the other . 
less examinations 
since the beginning of the student protests last june , the education minister länder and university rectors have repeatedly in the mouth the buzzword : " étudiabilité . " 
but for the first time , this expression seems to take a practical significance . 
the accreditation council has decided to greatly reduce the number of some exams : " each module must be reached by a single examination , " writes a document of a thirty pages on the future conditions for admission to the university cycles . 
reinhold grimm , president of the council of accreditation says that significantly reducing the burden of the examinations we should be able to stop the slide , which hurting considerably in the étudiabilité . 
" étudiabilité " should also be , in the future , the decisive criterion of the organization of studies . 
the modules as the substance must be examined carefully to see if we can avoid this feeling of stifling that it sometimes feels in the choice of course . 
hamburg / berlin - according to the latest knowledge on kunduz raid , the opposition believes that the minister of defense karl-theodor zu guttenberg ( csu ) is guilty of deliberate deception . 
students should " have the opportunity and the leeway to allow and encourage the personal initiative . " 
the new regulation will apply to access to the new university rounds but will also be adapted to the existing cycles . 
these cycles must be " réaccrédités " every five years , which means , however , that it is only by 2015 that all rounds have been examined . 
there are 10 agencies competent accreditation on the entire federal territory who depend on accreditation council created by the länder . 
in october , the ministers of education had exerted some pressure on the länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes are not too loaded and the regime exams not too strict . 
in some länder , universities and specialist colleges have already heard with their regional ministries to take the appropriate measures . 
the rhineland-palatinate is so far the only land to have agreed to give more money to the development of the bologna process . 
with these funds , universities must organise massive programmes and strengthen the offices of educational guidance as well as the offices of examinations and the service of international relations 
the länder and universities to provide a budget of 10 million euros . 
in early 2010 , the government wants to submit to parliament an amendment to the law on the institutions of higher education . 
following this , there will be no more than a single review to close his studies . 
the organisation studies must be more flexible , more , it must be able to ensure the recognition of increased notes other institutions of higher education and access to the master 's needs to be simplified . 
by the end of next year , the " étudiabilité " all the university cycles will be examined . 
last thursday , the government and the opposition again have debated the question of study conditions in the country . 
the decisions were appreciated but there have been some criticisms . 
the federal president of the union of students socialists has indicated that he would like the organisation of the educational policy is more in the future " behind closed doors " of ministers and the rectors of universities . 
at the latest after the strike educational , students as people concerned should be able to speak a little . 
the future diplomés of higher education we received the support of president delegates from the conference of vice-chancellors ( hrk ) margret wintermantel : " the experience of students we is very useful , " she said thursday during a meeting with the education ministers länder with which the hrk is working on a plan to reform common . 
for the trade union of education and science ( gew ) the decisions taken in bonn do not go far enough . he is calling for the law and the possibility for each graduate bachelor to register to a cycle of masters . 
andreas keller member of the steering committee of gew request that the länder provide students bachelor today , that tomorrow there will be enough places for studies in the masters and the conditions of studies as good as possible . 
the länder must therefore hire more responsible . 
by contrast , the ministers of education have not mentioned the possibility of ease access to the masters . 
more than a note at the bottom of page on herta müller 
it is by these words " arrival in germany and it is a beautiful , almost more control ... " that begins the poet werner söllner , in which he thématise in scraps phrases puzzling , the experiences of a dissident arrived in germany that won the freedom , but has lost at the same time its territory language . 
werner söllner , born in 1951 to banat in romania , was first professor of german and english to bucharest and , subsequently , director of collection in a publishing house for youth before settling in frankfurt on the hand . 
söllner has received various literary prize ; in 1993 , he was the much-desired professorship of poetry of goethe university in frankfurt and since 2002 it is director of the forum of literature of hesse to the house of artist of mousonturm in frankfurt . 
he has done a lot of talk about him in literary circles not last tuesday , during a congress in munich , whose theme was " the german literature in romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your files securitate . " 
visibly destabilized and embarrassed , söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his colleagues germano-roumains writers like richard wagner , william totok , franz hodjak , and helmuth frauendorfer that he had worked as an informant for the police securitate policy . 
söllner received in 1989 , the price of the german language , together with some of the participants . 
the trials of recruitment had begun insidiously in 1971 . 
i am , concludes söllner " so someone who has not been able to resist the trials of intimidation of the securitate . " 
the poet werner söllner is the informant walter ( im walter ) . 
almost simultaneously with the honoration nobel prize for herta müller and his literary disentangled copies with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship , the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of german authors from romania , for a case which clearly shows the abyss and the heinous act of a political system , based on police surveillance and espionage . 
werner söllner is , as far as we can tell by the current knowledge , not just guilty but also victim . 
in his own dossier securitate , im walter has played a role , ensures the specialist literature michael markel after the confession of söllner and it refers to the positive influence of im walter who had intervened in its favour . 
" he had been able to learn from all the difficult situations at the time , " after markel . 
markel moralde felt the need to make this comment . 
the form in which söllner made his statement and before this public was unexpected , however , the admission of a former dissident its cooperation with the romanian secret services is , in fact , not so surprising . 
germany is a reserve enjoyable for the spies of the securitate had already written herta müller in july in the journal " die zeit , " having read the 914 pages of his own dossier . 
we can assume that the victims have made of speculation and sometimes have guessed what real names last hid the names of loans sorin , voicu and also walter . 
instead of germany where between time consultation of files of the stasi is a process reliable , the attitude to the legacy of the files of the securitate is still very confused . 
a systematic explanation has been repeatedly frustrated and slowed in the past . 
it was not until 1999 that a national council corresponding to the institution birthler has been created to work to assimilation of archives of the securitate ( cnsas ) but the return of the files has dragged on since . 
there are since 2005 a law which defines the management of archives . 
that the influence of former members of the securitate in romania is still very high , is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the securitate of temesvar which , after the announcement of the award of the nobel prize to herta müller , is so dismissive very extended to the winner . 
she had a psychosis , and ultimately had questioned only once . 
the disgrace of power was thought to be able to speak here , without any gene , under the guise of freedom of expression . 
of course , inevitable questions are involved in the case söllner as so often happens in a context of guilt hidden . 
why now ? which has been deprived ? the reaction of the listeners , the admission of söllner , gives us hope that the result of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst to know that by accusations and a sense of shame . 
on the genesis of the work of herta müller , who has yesterday received the nobel prize , it is more than a note at the bottom of the page . 
turmoil in the champions league 
we had the impression that a representative came here , best coming straight from a christmas party cool , on which the manufacturer of articles of sport had spread its goods when the new coach vfb christian gross monta at a quarter to midnight in a mercedes c class , he had just call , an orange plastic bag of supplier to the hand . 
the man , whose skull bald drew attention , allowed himself to drive in the city that it was still foreign . 
otherwise our quinquagénaire could take itself the wheel - he had not drunk alcohol , and this was not drunk happiness . 
he had spent a pleasant evening but tomorrow we had to go back to work . 
because it is now that it was going to start . 
the words of switzerland that we had to take three days earlier were clear : " we have reached the final eighth of , " that is to say in the champions league thanks to our 3 : 1 against unirea urziceni romania " but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by the success . it will be a brutal struggle not to fall . " 
the " hard work " we expected sunday . 
here , it is to repeat in mainz the results of the champions league on a daily basis . 
and it will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three goals of hurried marica ( 5 . ) , träsch ( 8 . ) and pogrebnyak ( 11 ) . 
lottery 
the eighth final of the champions league match go 16 . / 17 . + 23 . / 24 february / return match 9 . / 10 . + 16 . / 17 march ) will be drawn to the fate the 18 december in nyon . 
the joy of the entry of the successor to cap pistols babbel was therefore moderate . 
and the joy was not only moderate among those who brought a chance , which had forwarded professionals in stuttgart destabilised , motivated and the pleasure of play . 
i have been to see the players and i told them that they should concentrate on their strengths , i have advised them to be more courageous , explained the plumber " souls " - gross - the recipe for success that sounded if bienmais who was more of an effect with the healer babbel . 
it has triggered a certain magic , confessed jens lehmann - supporter of babbel - , " in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that you would never have believed possible . " 
and sami khedira who , after weeks of pause to injury , proposed as the best player thanks to his dynamism , tried to describe the " phenomenon " seen by a proverbial " fresh winds " and the method of work of the new leader : " this is someone who is taking action and requires discipline . 
that is what we need in the current situation . " 
but apparently babbel had missed . 
the vfb stuttgart has not yet passed the course , warned the manager horst heldt 
for the moment , vfb stuttgart are in need of tenacity . 
just as gross , the players and the manager tightlipped about to overstate the victory against a defense totally overwhelmed and weakened guests romanians . 
they had also won in glasgow before having had four days later a bad awakening to leverkusen with the 0 : 4 , objecta khedira . 
horst heldt , the manager , signala they had well reached one of the goals of the season but they had other which were still very far . 
we have not yet past the difficult hurdle . 
that heldt the day of his 40th anniversary does not have the heart to celebrate , even after the first victory at home for three months , is due to the events of the weekend that a television interview the guardian of aim jens lehmann did pick up just before the start of the game . 
there are decisions that other take and not jens , contrecarrait heldt , in response to the criticism of lehmann . 
he accused the direction of weakness of style and said that it had decided to change of coach under the pressure of pubertaires fans . 
lehmann had judged also as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and envy the fact that his day of free after games he has been removed . 
the statements of lehmann were " marked by a pure selfishness " slid heldt and announced the consequences for the guardian of goal . 
they risked more become friends for life these two 40-year-olds . 
in any cast , they agreed to everything else , that is to say that without the work of the group by the coach replaced , the strong sports representation restive and would not have been possible . 
babbel and his assistants have been " for a large part in the success " rétorquèrent heldt and lehmann together - and even the man in the plastic bag acquiesça .

hot battle in bern : kevin johnson -style challenger constantly verbally and gestuellement the champion of the world vitali klitschkos .

johnson , of 11 inches smaller , which before the duel , had announced the end of the era klitschko , managed to avoid the blows of empéchant klitschko champion , and to his dangerous game against the right .

this summer , hague had cancelled a match against vitali klitschko which was to have taken place in september . 
it appears that his development company intends to do play now this game at wembley stadium in london . 
the case kunduz 
frontal attack of the opposition : the head of the green group , jürgen trittin , has accused the minister of defense guttenberg of lying in the case of the case kunduz . 
the spd party and the left ( the left ) ask the chancellor explanations . 
hamburg / berlin - after considering the latest information on the air attack of kunduz , the opposition has accused the minister of defence karl-theodor zu guttenberg ( csu ) to have délibérémentdissimulé some facts . 
the minister has intentionally " made a fiction " on the murderous hits two tankers in september , said the head of the green group , jürgen trittin , on saturday during the emission of information of the chain " tagesschau ard " ( the journal of 20h ) . 
clearly , this means that he lied . 
the order to kill , was given in total disregard for the rules of the international security assistance force in afghanistan ( isaf ) . 
it is , in essence , the content of the report available to nato and which has been read by mr guttenberg trittin , said . 
last friday , according to new revelations of the media , the aim of lafrappe was in reality , not to destroy the stolen trucks , but sought to eliminate two taliban leaders important . 
according to the report of the inquiry of nato , 142 people had been killed or injured in the attack american airline which was launched at the request of the german colonel goerg klein , military commander of kunduz . 
the greens , the spd and the left have asked saturday chancellor angela merkel ( cdu ) , to vote as soon as possible before the federal parliament and reveal what guttenberg really knew on the incident . 
jürgen trittin and his colleague from the green party renate künast are of the opinion that mrs merkel must say clearly if the strategy of targeted massacre is part of the government 's afghan policy fédéralet if the chancellery , the army and intelligence services have approved the new strategy . 
the government spokesman categorically reject these criticisms . 
the chancellery has in no way influenced the interventions of the army in afghanistan , he said . 
on saturday , the voices were increasingly strong to express doutesquant the real reasons the referral of the inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan and the secretary of state peter wichert , such that it had been presented by the ministry . 
according to the intelligence of the newspaper spiegel , the information that they had called to guttenberg concerning the attack tankers were both accurate and complete . 
officially , they would have concealed the existence of the report of nato and hidden the minister some details troublesome . 
in the vicinity of the two senior officials , it suggests , however , that they have informed the ministry of defence of the existence of several reports , including a document of two pages of colonel klein as well as a report by military police . 
" the frankfurter allgemeiner sonntagszeitung reported that " wichert would have meanwhile demanded in a letter a clarification of the facts . 
so far , it has not been answered 
on saturday , the ministry did not wish to comment on the allegations and referred to the committee of inquiry of the federal parliament which was going to be the next wednesday in order to provide the light on the events in question . 
the worlds of dream 
some see , while awake , images and hear voices that nobody else sees or hears . 
it is not only among the sick mental or under the influence of drugs , that the limits between imagination and reality mix . 
as long as these phenomena occur during sleep , everything is going very well . 
when we are laying in our bedrooms overshadowed , we can do without barriers to dreams and wildest fantasies . 
however that , awake , experienced dream , hear and see things that others do not perceive , has quickly the reputation in our western world to be crazy or junkie , or at least be an original . 
such images and voices do not appear that among the mental ill or under the effect of the drugs . 
this is our imagination that is in question : this is the same neural activity which allows us to design houses , paint pictures or write novels , but that sometimes prompts the boundaries between the dream , madness and reality to melt . 
a state of conscious awakening , taking the form of a dream , can be presented in the most diverse forms , in the best case we call this visions , at worst madness . 
but even if the trigger and the effect distinguish themselves , the visions of the mystical hildegard von bingen , the experiences of drugs in the prophet of the new age carlos castaneda , the latter of chamanes , psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to the process very similar . 
there are hallucinations or delusions when the balance , substances neurotransmettrices of the brain - first dopamine , noradrenaline , serotonin and achétylcholine - breaks down and that the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted . 
hallucinations complex and wild thoughts are very often during a psychosis , schizophrenic . 
the force of earth 's attraction has more power on the person . 
since antiquity , philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between the madness and the dream . 
for aristotle , hallucinations were a form of rêve-éveillé ; wilhelm griesinger , one of the founders of modern psychiatry , found in 1861 " a great resemblance between the madness and the dream , " to sigmund freud the dream was even " a psychosis with all irregularities , imaginations , delusions and sensory illusions that the composed . " 
we are in the autumn of 2001 when henning t turns into a comic strip character . 
his body is in two dimensions to the criardes colors . 
the land attraction has more power on him , the tidal hangs from the ceiling . 
he feels a blow . 
behind him creatures of winged devil , grimaçantes bloodstained , mouths , showing the teeth . 
they continue , give it a few feet with heavy boots flamboyantes , the cast against the walls , he feels the pain throughout the body . 
the thundering voice , evil , roar , coming out of the walls and the radio . 
it can no longer bear these voices who insult and humiliate him . 
henning t. severs two cables of its chain stereo , in fact a loop and attaches it to a hook set the ceiling . 
it gets on a baffle and happens the loop around the neck . 
he jumps . 
the loop stands out . 
that is a lesson to you , shouting the voice in a chorus to extract the eardrum . " goes in a clinic and fais-toi cure ! " 
today henning t. has 40 years ago , he lived six psychoses acute , the last date of 2 years , the first of nearly 20 years . 
it has been triggered by lsd . 
the diagnosis : schizo-affective psychosis , paranoid , in addition , it is has bipolar disorder , he takes medication for depression , the mania , schizophrenia . 
he has learned to live with his illness , he is married for three years . 
during the psychosis i lived fears terrible and despondency deep . 
illusions are a harsh reality . 
around one percent of the population is suffering at least once in their lives schizophrenia ; in the psychiatric clinic is the most common illness after the depression . 
in a crisis of schizophrenia , people can no longer make the difference between the inside and the outside world , they are in a state of hyper arousal , which means that they can suffer from hallucinations , megalomania , relational madness or persecution . 
it is very common to hear of votes - the voices that command , which elicited comments or chat . 
the optical hallucinations are not uncommon either . 
the person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the trivial , the brain can no longer filter the disruptive signals , the conscious is drowned under the sensations . 
just as the dream , the hype opens the floodgates to a tide of ideas and fantasies outcome of deeper layers of consciousness . 
the perception of reality in the hype is centered on the subject , according to professor thomas fuchs , head of the department of psychiatry of chu of heidelberg ( allgemeine psychiatry im universitätsklinikum ) . 
the schizophrenic is in the centre of the situation , all meaning focused on him . 
at the same time it is reflected in a passive role , it is like a dream , overcome by events and may not act on them in an active . 
that is why the schizophrenic often feel threatened , controlled , manipulated . 
in general they do not have the opportunity to adjust the reality , illusions are a cruel reality , wake up is excluded . 
to experience a time in his life of a hallucination . 
unlike the dream , according to fuchs , " the sensory structure space and the reality that is seen during the psychosis is fundamentally retained . " 
the thoughts and wild hallucinations are based on the reality , the alienation of the experienced takes place in a real framework . 
why our brain it this kind of antics , is still a mystery to researchers . 
exceptional situations can bring everyone to momentarily lose the perception of reality , according to fuchs . 
but only a small number of people develop a psychosis . 
there seems to have a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia , but studies of twins have shown that the genes are not the only factors . 
researchers assume that the people involved are tiny brain damage . 
we assume that the neural maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development , for example , by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy , explains fuchs . 
but what is still unexplained , this is the way the anomaly of the neural system happens and also the fact that it is not for many years . 
environmental factors also play a role - stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis , however , if there is predisposition . 
of even the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they operate on the neurotransmitters . 
when our brain heats up . 
this is crazy , we said professor of psychology erich kasten of lübeck is that the suffering psychotic their hallucinations and take medicines expensive for getting rid of it while others buy drugs very expensive for obtaining them . 
the perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a matter of perspective . 
kasten brings together for ten years of reports on hallucinations and phenomena of images illusory : last year he published his results in a book entitled " the imaginary world in our head . " 
the hallucinations do well among the concomitant phenomena typical psychoses but also an impressive number of many other diseases . 
there are among they psychological problems such as borderline or depression but also the migraine , epilepsy , multiple sclerosis , alzheimer 's disease or head injury . 
it is surprising that in certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations . 
the hallucinations , according to kasten , consists of fragments of memories that are normally inhibés . 
they take form when the areas of the brain sensory perceptions , are overactive or not enough refrénées ; when our brain 's warm but also when there is lack of stimulation . 
drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or a psychosis . 
but the lack of stimulus , stress , the sorrows of love or other exceptional mental states . 
in recent studies , a third of participants acknowledges having done at least once in his life experience a hallucination . 
in summer 2005 sarah k. 16 years ago , she lives a small town of previous pomerania and it goes to the school . 
a young girl to do everything to normal to tell the truth . 
if there had not the images and voices . 
during the recess , sometimes a boy , thin , the long hair châtain , send him the floor . 
when she meets his comrades watch , surprised - nobody else sees or hears this boy . 
they believe that this young girl timid is a lunatic dreamer but sarah k not dream , it is certain . 
it is awake , hear and see this boy as she sees and hears the girl who is sitting next to it on the bench . 
it can even see its presence temporarily . 
it is a pleasant sensation , she finds this young sympathetic . 
am i crazy ? , wonder it sometimes . 
but she knows that this young and other visions are not real and that they are going to disappear again . 
the night the outbreaks are , in general , frightening 
often the visions are heavy . 
when it is in class , it is that it cannot follow the course , because the professor is right presenting a new pupil in her eyes and her ears when it is invisible to others and that the teacher is visibly explaining equations in the picture . 
the night the outbreaks are , in general , frightening . 
when , in the darkness of his bedroom , it expects the sleep which happens all too rarely and far too late , it often cannot distinguish if it is awake or dream already , if the images that she sees , faces grimaçants or the girl with sanguinolentes cuts on the arms and legs are in front of their eyes open or closed . 
let me quiet , it screams to these creatures . 
it does not speak to his parents and his friends , they would for a crazy . 
autumn 2009 . sarah k. is now 20 years old . 
it has had its masters last year and she lives with his friend . 
it was a year ago hallucinations have ceased . 
since she came in contact by the internet with the psychologist kasten she knows very well that it is not crazy . 
the madness is also a work of art of despair . 
when someone is socially isolated or has not enough incentives , the likelihood is that he has hallucinations after a certain time . 
i assume that the brain is not quite busy , means that there are of animation . 
sarah k. , single girl , was afraid of other children when she was small and playing often alone . 
the hallucinations began when she learned to 13 years , that the man she called daddy , since she was in age of thinking , was not his real father . 
these are the same brain regions that are active for the visual hallucinations and acoustic , and for the impressions and real noises , so it is very difficult for people like sarah k to tell the difference between the illusion and reality . " every experience , " according to kasten " takes place in the brain , the reality is formed from there . 
hallucinations are also images that form in the brain , which is why they seem so real . " 
for kasten night , dreams are also a form of hallucination . 
the hallucinations of healthy people differ not fundamentally those acute psychoses . 
unlike the schizophrenic , the person mentally healthy is able to recognise that the fantasies are not actual pictures . 
that is why kasten advises her patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent . 
there is only a step between the dream and the hallucination . 
in our world too focused on the conscience has unfortunately been quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for diseases , according to michael schmidt-degenhard , a professor at heidelberg and doctor head of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy of the hospital florence nightingale in düsseldorf . 
a psychosis is a serious illness , painful but which also contains something positive , creator - the madness is a work of art of despair . 
schmidt-degenhard has studied the form of so-called oniroïde experience , a particular form of the change of consciousness awake by the dream . 
the experienced oniroïdes semi-rêves are very complex which are perceived as real by anyone who lives and that he cannot differentiate the dream even when it is in a state of awareness . 
the state of consciousness oniroïde manifests itself for a trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathie which fully aware , are the experience of a paralysis engine . 
according to schmidt-degenhard , when a human being is threatened by a loss of itself and the world , due to a complete inability and sustainable move , it replaces the real situation which undermines his life , by his own fantasy world which is divorced from reality . 
it is a state of mental limit between the dream and the hallucination . 
as it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality , a change in the world has to take place , but the real situation is represented in the imagination . 
it is , in fact , a form of means and interpretation , in a situation intolerable in itself , a capacity of organisation which is given , to men , not to sink into the nothingness of the loss of consciousness . 
everything is real even later in the memories . 
the zurichois peter classen cornelius , art historian also describes his experiences oniroïdes in his book " change of heart " as action to safeguard the soul . 
it has 49 years ago , at a time when its aware hand for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed a transplant ; meanwhile , his body is sentenced to sit still in critical care . 
claussen plunges in a world that it has created all coins , visit places foreigners , journey in time . it sees in old man in a bed sanatorium rail , a robot at his bedside care on her health . 
he lives in the middle ages among the noble that manufacture drugs to basis of blood . 
it is kidnapped by a greek motorbikes which takes him in his country , he surf with his hospital bed in the névé of the alps and meeting a korean mafia . 
it absorbs completely in this fantasy world , everything is real even later in his memories . 
according to claussen these domestic travel differ fundamentally from any dream . 
the dream is a state quite different , " he writes in describing what he has experienced . 
on the contrary dreams , the memories from the mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later . 
we can even say that they are much more distinctive and more intensive the experience real . 
the intensity of this had been splintered the horizon of our other everyday experiences , according to the psychiatrist schmidt-degenhard . 
ultimately , the delusions oniroïdes , psychoses , hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how much our internal representations of external reality are fragile even in a state of eve . 
any change of consciousness , sums up the psychologist kasten " can cause a distortion of what we call reality . " 
an experience that can also be quite enriching . 
the first snow can fall . 
burda 
27 years ago , children will take the continuation of the publishing house . 
the appointment of kallen as ceo of editions burda is an intermediate solution : more long term , hubert burda hope that his two children take up the group of press , he told the newspaper spiegel . 
the holding company must remain 100 % a family business . 
hamburg - has long term , the publisher hubert burda sees his company in the hands of its children 
the two children will inherit to 27 years and are committed to integrate society , said hubert burda , 69 years , spiegel . 
all the details have been settled in advance . 
the question of whether they will be active in the company will arise in the future . 
it will also see if they are capable of . 
we cannot impose its children to 25 employees without whether they have the capacity to deal with it . 
that will blow away a children as well as the company . 
burda had announced last thursday that it was withdrawing from the post président-directeur-général from the months of january and that his successor was paul-bernhard kallen . 
kallen , 52 years , is a member of the board since 1999 . 
it was first responsible for the technology sector . 
subsequently he held the sector treasury that is to say that it was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of jürgen todenhöfer he was the head of marketing , the sector foreigner , the impression and finance . 
and for the first time this is not a family member who is the head of editions burda . 
the children of burda respectively 19 and 17 years , his son felix , which would have today 42 years , died a few years ago . 
the nommination of kallen also serves to make the connection of the 10 or 15 years " 
burda specifies that the holding company must remain 100 % between the hands of the family . 
the ruins have always happened in the families who have left lead by a compulsive desire for capital , which have made enormous speculation unfortunate in thinking that they could climb ever higher . 
this has never been my strategy . 
i have never had rêvede universal power , said burda . 
i am absolutely not in the role of a tutor as could be springer and i do not intend to be part of these international leagues as the time , these companies have taken much too much importance .

zapatero predicts " a future of peace " for the sector of the engine 
the president of the government , josé luis rodríguez zapatero , predicts " a future of peace " for the spanish automobile industry which , he said , is the main export sector of the country . 
during the presentation of the economic report of the president of the government for 2009 , zapatero has recalled the measures taken by the executive during the year in order to support the automobile sector . 
" without a plan of competitiveness in the automotive sector , we would now have a landscape of abandonment , closure of some of our main production sites , " said the president of the government .

mazda3 i-stop : a sustainable sporting spirit 
mazda intends to prove that the sporting spirit is not angry with respect for the environment . 
to this end , she has to include on the mazda3 the system of judgment and engine start , called i-stop , a device which , at least for the moment , is available only on the engine 2.0 in essence of 150 horses . 
this second generation of mazda3 be illustrated by the note that it has achieved in its entirety . 
the details , the finishing of the vehicle , the board , the behaviour , the mechanics , the system i-stop ... 
all these aspects are remarkable on the new mazda3 . 
starting with the post of conduct , it turns out that the seats are fronts ergonomics and a setting excellent . 
the touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant . 
by continuing with the whole formed by the picture of control and the games console , we see how mazda has continued in the japanese tendency to create a design of interior futuristic , with many buttons and orders , as well as colorful in red and blue . 
this style reminds us , in part , the honda civic . 
that is why we can say that both the mazda3 that the civic , all two japanese , contrast with the sobriety of german products , and especially with the volkswagen golf , that all want to surpass . 
continuing with the japanese car , this compact presents a habitability more than enough to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort . 
add to this a great boot the forms regular . 
the system of judgment and automatic start-up of the engine , at least for the moment , is available only on the petrol engine of two litres and 150 horses and with change manuel of the six speeds . 
this engine is a true happiness . it is distinguished by its finesse , his low noise , its benefits and the mastery of its consumption . 
indeed , although the mazda3 most requested are the diesel models , those who do not carry out a large number of miles per year should not exclude this i-stop with petrol engine , both for its great comfort of speed that for its consumption under control . 
on the level of equipment , the model chosen for the test is sports , in other words that which has the largest number of elements of series . 
among the series , the assistant to change of direction ( rvm ) , which removes the angle death , controls traction and stability , the regulator of speed , the mirror photosensitive internal , the on-board computer on a screen of great size , the parking sensors , the independent air conditioning , the sensor of rain and light , the bluetooth and the bluetooth audio , as well as the wheels of alignment of 17 inches , are particularly remarkable . 
moreover , as if this equipment was not enough , this version had the pack schedules , which for eur 1 500 more , includes , among other elements of the adaptive headlights bi-xénon and audio system bose with charger records . 
conclusion 
the mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best tight cars in its class . 
it illustrates in particular by the quality of the materials used , by his behavior and by its level of equipment high . 
in addition , those who are not doing a lot of miles per year will be able to choose the version i-stop associated with only the petrol engine 2.0 150 horses . 
the only drawback of this model is its high price , which lies between 21 770 euros for finishing luxury and 23 eur 270 for the model tested , the sport . 
in return for this important sum , the mazda3 will give us every day a large dose of satisfaction .

the promise of fonpeek 
peek is extremely limited , it is a mechanism which allows only to look at his e-mail , without offering the possibility if only to see certain type of enclosures or surf the internet . 
he tabled its five minutes of fame in the united states , when the magazine the act as one of the products of the year . 
in truth , it is more difficult to see in the street , but the idea seems interesting , especially for young people . 
unlike the smart phones , peek offers a price and a very low monthly subscription , or less than half of what it costs , for example , the subscription data of the iphone . 
given his success , the company has launched two new devices : one designed exclusively for twitter , the other with a free service of data to life , for six times more expensive than the peek . 
fonpeek , presented yesterday at the event the web , is the european version of invention and its third incarnation . 
it is also limited its grand-frère american , but includes a surprise . 
the price of its monthly subscription , around 12 euros , includes the roaming across europe . 
those who travel with a smart phone already know what represents the fact of abandoning the data when you cross a border or desperately seeking a cafeteria on wi-fi ( or a connection of fon ) to check his mail . 
the idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it is a long time that it should operate . 
indeed , some operators have special arrangements and options journey , but for me , i would need to have made a theory in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small print . 
the repeated reminders to the european commission to propose roaming fees affordable in the whole of europe have had a barely perceptible . 
outside their country of origin , people hesitate to use the data , and it was not wrong . 
a small device as the fonpeek ( it is still curious , he is called fon so that it does not have wifi ) offers this type of tariffs , means that operators are starting to think differently and to study various proposals allowing them to make their data network . 
the kindle is another good example , he understands the downloading of books and other research on the internet . 
without subscription and without soup . 
it is a device connected and you pay during its purchase and not every month . 
and that is what i hope to see a day for the fonpeek : an option to purchase with access to life as peek proposes already in the united states . 
not that i want to buy it . 
i look at my mail on my phone , thank you . 
i would simply because i believe that this is a more fair formula for the consumer . 
it would be interesting to see a computer with the same system . 
the favorite color of michelle 
the yellow is , without doubt , the favorite color of the first lady of the united states . 
if it went to the inauguration of barack obama to the presidency of the united states with a dress and a coat of this color , she has , indeed , chosen the same for the match in the second time , without doubt , the most important of his life : the award in oslo the nobel peace prize . 
michelle obama wore a model very similar in these two occasions : in addition to their color ressemblante , drawing a yellow to green with reflections brilliant , both times , the holding consisted of three parts : the dress , the jacket and the coat , in the same tissues , and was adorned with a large embroidery or a collier . 
so a first glance , it would appear that the first lady of the united states follows the wake of the princess of asturias and has chosen to get the same kept . 
but the fabric in which are carved up the two blocs makes them very different . 
if the assumption of office , it was a delicate manoeuvring thick , however , she was in oslo a velvet printed . 
accessories also are different : green shoes to heel way for the first opportunity , and a similar model , but golden , this time . 
hairdressing it , too , has changed : the hair are now met while she was released the last time . 
75 % of working mothers have had problems professionals because of their maternity 
discrimination at work has increased in recent years , especially for women of young people who want to be mothers . 
it is this that reveals the study " fertility and career women in spain , " carried out by the csic in collaboration with the instituto the mujer . 
the inquiry , carried out on 9 737 women of 15 to 75 years , leaves no room for doubt : 75 % of working mothers have seen their career limited because of motherhood . 
the study indicates that there are many differences on the beginning of life as a couple , and the number of children , if the woman is working or not , and the type of employment occupied . 
those who have not of activity outside the home , work part-time work or have a little stable , are earlier in couple , have their first pregnancy sooner and have more children . 
however , women who have a stable job , mainly in the public sector , postpone the entry in life as a couple , and the first pregnancy , and have fewer children . 
women between 35 and 49 years with a fixed work have their first child , on average , 3,7 years after being installed as couples . this figure rises to 4,1 among those who work in the public sector . " these data show that women who have a stable job had need more time in their lives to get it , which has led to the postponement of the union and the arrival of the children . 
in addition , the type of employment exercised influence largely motherhood , but less the starting date of common life , " explains the researcher of csic margarita delgado . 
the level of studies is another factor that widening the gap of the age of marriage of women and their first child . 
according to the survey , the higher the level of training is high , the more they marry and have their first child later . 
the difference is also maintains among women of the same generation . 
for example , in the group have between 35 and 49 years , those who have made studies basic and higher respectively have been mothers for the first time to 25,1 and 32,1 years on average . 
" another disctinction also appears between women , depending on their level of studies . 
while those who have done the basic studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job , those who have done studies of average level or above reverse this programme and give priority to obtaining a stable work as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child , " says mrs delgado .

a cowardly attack 
last week , my mother , which has about 70 years , was walking in our neighborhood of the city of fuenlabrada , when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent by her side and our dog , a sang-mélé , saved the aps and weighing no more than six pounds , and without saying a word , they assenèrent two strokes of feet which left the dog seriously injured . 
our outrage is huge because we do not see this as there are fun to attack free of charge a small animal without defence which , in addition , was in leaves . 
add to this the indignation of a woman who was walking calmly and who , when she injuria these individuals , in came to fear for his physical integrity , since a énergumène who attack an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman , a child , an old man , or , in short , anyone lower than him . 
the episode came to 17 hours , a tuesday as another , in a neighborhood usually quiet . 
the dog has gémi all day . 
of course , we have filed complaints to the police station in the neighborhood , even if we doubt that this serves to much , and not to touch the sensitivities , we just want to say that the cowardly killers were spanish . 
the indignation has led us to denounce this fact . 
we do not understand what is happening among young people for that they are fun to mistreat free a defenceless animal which gives us the affection , friendship and keeps us airline . 
we do not know where is the good education and respect of animals and people . 
michelin and fesvial , sets for wearing helmets 
the michelin tyre manufacturer , in cooperation with the spanish foundation for traffic safety ( fesvial ) , has launched a campaign to encourage wearing helmets , mainly among motorcyclists youngsters , as have announced today the two structures . 
this initiative is intended to raise awareness of the importance of wearing helmets , since it is the only element of protection to prevent injury to the head , or even death , in the event of an accident in two wheels . 
michelin has indicated that this campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety , which " goes beyond the design and manufacture of products always more safe " and said that it contributed to this goal by other actions to educational and informative . 
this new campaign of encouragement to the port of the helmet in two wheels , under the motto " to be but not to be , " will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages of motorcycles , in order to ensure the widest spread . 
finally , michelin has stressed that road safety " is a constant concern " for the company , because as a tyre manufacturer two-wheeled vehicles , one of its main goals is to develop products always safer . 
the sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing 
after almost two years , the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel . 
the 9 425 vehicles registered in november in spain represent an increase of 12,6 % compared to 2008 , and what is more important , they are the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline , according to the figures from the trade union business sectors of manufacturers anfac and ganvam , the dealers . 
however , it should be qualify the good news , since the reference for comparison , the month of november 2008 , has been particularly bad , with a decrease of 60 % compared to the previous year . 
as a result , despite the events of last month , the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40 % below those of the previous year . 
since january , if you add up all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles ( derived from cars , pickup truck , vans , fourgons light and lorries to lightweight chassis ) 95 853 have been sold . 
the big clouds that affect the more their demand have not provided dispelled . indeed , although they are also bought by individuals , most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises , who pay in almost 100 % of cases thanks to an external funding . 
thus , in more restrictions involved by limiting the bank lending , we need to add other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation . 
faced with this situation , and unlike cars , aid to the purchase of the 2000e have little used . 
in addition to the individuals , the self-employed and small businesses who want to acquire a commercial vehicle slight less 3,5 tonnes with a level of co2 emissions which does not exceed the 160 grams per kilometre , can also benefit from it , but the number of operations speaks for itself . 
yesterday , among ganvam , we recalled again the need for the administration to attach attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles ( lorries and buses ) . 
the association of dealers provides a year 2010 similar to that which ends , for which it calculates a drop in sales ( for passenger cars and 4x4s ) of 19 % . 
the emergency braking is now obligatory 
as has occurred with the system anti-lock brakes abs and , as this will take place with the esp stability control , the braking systems of emergency will be a mandatory part on european cars . 
they are already mandatory in cars of tourism and light commercial vehicles , while newly registered for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been set until the end of february 2011 . 
the measure , imposed by the european union , is intended to strengthen the protection of pedestrians , even if , by his mode of action , it can also help prevent many rear shocks . 
the assistant emergency braking is increasing the pressure on the brakes in emergency cases detected by the system through kicked given by the driver . 
but it does not always keeps the pressure until the end . 
according to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars bosch , a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to rely on the brake before the collision , and half of them had not benefited from its full force . 
up to 1 100 accidents 
the intervention of aid , revancha , requires the most of the brake system , reducing the distance that the car needs to stop . 
according to a study of the eu , if all cars were equipped with this type of elements , until 1 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be prevented each year . 
this reduction would be even more important with popularizing of the so-called intelligent systems emergency braking : we calculate that a sinister on four with injuries would be avoided . 
in this case , the vehicle is equipped with a system which , thanks to a radar or a camera detects the obstacles and warns the driver , in addition to act slightly on the brakes . 
if the driver reacts , it aid by increasing the pressure on the pedal , if that is necessary . 
if it does not act , and although the collision is inevitable , the device is the maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimise the damage . 
general motors postponed until january the plan for opel 
while workers at opel 's figueruelas plant ( zaragoza ) have been warned by nick reilly , the new president of general motors ( gm ) europe , that the production of the new meriva model would be launched during the first week of april - probably the 8 - , according to javier ortega , the north american manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the rescue of opel . 
nick reilly , the new president of gm europe , each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the relevant part . 
and this can mean that the final document , which will first be subjected to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories , be postponed until early 2010 . 
however , in gm , it ensures that a decision on the sale of saab should be taken in the next few days .
