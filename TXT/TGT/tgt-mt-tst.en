yet a crucial step for the balkans 
since the world is focused on iraq , north korea and a possible crisis with iran on the issue of nuclear weapons , kosovo happening a little unnoticed . 
the public will soon have the opportunity to again turn its attention to this province during a decision on his fate . 
the united states and their european friends have repeatedly announced their intention to take before the end of the year the difficult decision to separate or not kosovo from serbia . 
this decision , crucial to the future of an unstable region , will test the determination and the unity of the west . 
the talks this year in vienna , orchestrated by the united nations , have shown that an agreement between serbia and kosovo on a " final status " will never see the light of day . 
negotiations are continuing , but , as with much tact the negotiator of the un and former finnish president martti ahtisaari on the security council , they died in the facts . 
no serbian leader will not accept the independence of kosovo , because nationalism remains the dominant political force in the country . 
indeed , prime minister vojislav kostunica , apostle of serbian nationalism , has sought by all means to undermine the interim government of kosovo . 
it is eager to hold a national referendum this month on a new constitution without parliamentary debate serious or the usual training of the public . 
the main goal of this new constitution takes in his preamble , which maintains the kosovo in its status of inalienable part of serbia . 
the kosovo albanians have said that they will not accept no link with serbia , so tiny that it is . 
throughout the 1990s , they are practically out of kosovo managed by the serbs by creating institutions parallels . 
their mass exodus of forced to 1999 and the nato intervention that followed , putting an end to the reign of serbia and establishing a quasi-state under the aegis of the un , has made intolerable any other solution than independence . 
within a month or two , the contact group of the balkans , either the united states , the united kingdom , france , germany , italy and russia , will consider the recommendations of ahtisaari on the final status of kosovo and will propose perhaps a solution to the security council , which must take the final decision . 
in public , all the members of the contact group tried to leave the issue the final status of kosovo open , but in private the united states and some of his allies have said the two parties that they would propose the independence this year . 
some members of the security council , including russia and china , take a dim view or remain sceptical about a solution imposed , and few governments are for the division of the territory of another country , compelling person under any circumstances . 
the choice of the security council to approve the independence depends largely on the possibility of preventing a russian veto , which will require considerable diplomatic efforts . 
the nature of the independence granted is also important . 
the independent kosovo must be able to live in safety and its minorities must be protected . 
the north of kosovo , today largely under the control of belgrade , must not be partitioned of fact while the being no name . 
in order to reduce the blow to serbia , it must be that the security council avoids grant independence so distorted that the new state cannot really work . 
if the security council fails to take a decision on a final status , it will cause a critical situation : kosovo will declare independence unilaterally and all nations must decide not to recognise the new state . 
if that happens , it is very likely that the serbs in the north of kosovo will declare their own independence . 
at a minimum , serbia will strongly campaign against any recognition . 
in fact , the government of serbia are already trying to convince the west to delay the decision until mid-2007 . 
he claims that if kosovo becomes independent , the ultra-nationalist radical party will be there again in power at the next elections , and believes that hold elections as early as this year will spur the contact group to postpone its proposal to the security council . 
in addition , the government has encouraged the leaders of the republika srpska from bosnia to threaten to organise their own referendum on the separation of a bosnia still fragile . 
and they continue to push , unsuccessfully , for the referral of ahtisaari in order to extend the discussions in vienna . 
the timing of the organisation of the constitutional referendum appears to be part of this strategy dilatory . 
some hope that a postponement will stimulate violence in kosovo and pushes the west to reconsider the independence of kosovo . 
this tactic may be working . 
many eu countries are concerned about the implications of the withdrawal of territory of a country , as well as the impact of the independence of kosovo on serbian democracy . 
given the political instability of serbia , they doubt the damage that would cause a postponement in the short term , which would be mostly self-inflicted . 
but postpone the decision would only allow kostunica to find new ways to make it even more difficult a decision by the security council . 
the west must ignore the siren song of belgrade . 
serbian politics will be chaotic and unstable in the near future , and serbian politicians will try to use this situation as an excuse to avoid facing up to the loss of kosovo . 
in the same way , links between serbia and kosovo , whatever the circumstances , will be problematic . 
but a failure to make a decision today permanently on the final status of kosovo will produce a worse situation in the balkans , will hamper the progress of serbia towards the west and its accession to the eu , blames the ethnic minorities in kosovo to a dangerous ambiguity and will undermine fragile states such as bosnia and macedonia . 
the only realistic solution for kosovo is independence . 
if serbia wants to join the west , it must not abandon this opportunity in fall for his nationalist past . 
dawn new and dangerous for south korea 
the decision to north korea to expel the inspectors in atomic energy of the united nations is one more reason to look at the election of roh moo hyun to the presidency of south korea two weeks earlier as a historic landslide . 
the beginning of his term coincides not just with one of the most dangerous episodes of the korean peninsula for decades , but his presidency will also be the witness to a test of relations between the us and south korea to a degree never reached in the past . 
the victory of roh on lee hoi chang shows a change of generation in the korean policy , with a youth determined to win a freedom of movement in its relations with the united states . 
in fact , the differences of generation were the decisive factor in the race for the presidential election , replacing the regional feelings domin√®rent each race for the presidency before it . 
according to one report , more than 60 % of the population of 20-30 years ago voted for roh , creating a gap of 2,3 % in this race for the presidency where were found for the first time in 31 years two men face to face , fighting shoulder to shoulder . 
the position populist nationalist and roh will be quickly and sorely tested by reality when he will take his post in february . 
but one that combines the generational change that brought to power with a strong popular will continue the commitments to north korea , beyond the fact that north korea continues to strengthen itself on the nuclear plan , and the recipe is complete in a dispute with the us . 
roh , a self-taught legal who succeeds the examination of the bar without ever go to university and doing his right , has managed to convince the electorate that it would open a new era in politics , that better reflects a south korea enriched and whose middle class has strengthened , overturning the political games dominated by insiders , the regional disputes and the struggles of factions . 
his style and his rhetoric pushed for the image new ( for korea ! ) to a man of the people involved in the elimination of networks of favoritism and corruption bloated . 
for the first time in modern history of korea , the presidential campaign has really been the place of debates on the central issues facing the country has to face , rather than focusing on the parties and personalities . 
the candidate roh has called for new relations between south korea and the united states , based on the principle of independence and equality . 
thus , he announced no longer want to be in the wake of the us or wanting to travel to washington to take just the traditional picture . he has also promised to continue the policy of president kim dae jung , called " the policy of ray of sunshine " in its engagement with the north . 
it is remarkable that roh has won the election despite the decision of north korea reactivating its nuclear reactors arrested since 1994 . 
a few years earlier , such a gesture would have condemned the candidacy of roh . 
that it has surpassed this obstacle without a change of position on the commitment to north korea demonstrates that times have changed radically . 
the popular envy pressing for change rather than a comfortable situation now becomes the main concern of any average korean . 
the election campaign roh has also benefited from a growing trend for anti-americanism . 
the acquittal by an american military tribunal of two american soldiers who killed accidentally aboard their armored vehicle two korean schoolgirls in june sparked off of the street demonstrations across the country . 
although president george w. bush has apologized to two times for the deaths of two small girls , the requirements continued to accumulate to amend the agreement on the status of the armed forces ( status of force agreement , sofa ) , which governs the legal treatment reserved for american troops stationed in south korea . 
the koreans insist that the american soldiers who commit crimes should be judged by the courts koreans . 
this expression of national pride injured was possible after the extraordinary performance of the south korean team at the football world cup last summer , which helped convince the koreans to full maturity of their country , and this fact can now defend themselves without the presence of the 37 , 000 us soldiers . 
in fact , many koreans who see now the american presence , and not the communist regime in north korea , as the biggest obstacle to the unification . 
according to a recent poll , only 54,8 % of koreans still support the maintenance of american troops in the country , while 31,7 % oppose it . 
these feelings will form part of the test of diplomacy which will give its forms to the presidency of roh since its inception , since it must rethink relations between korea and the united states at the same time as the bush administration is agitated about north korea 's nuclear ambitions and its role in the spread of weapons of mass destruction in rogue states . 
for the moment , the korean voters , apparently insensitive to threats presented by the north korea 's nuclear weapons , support the policy of roh for the maintenance of dialogue and trade with the north . 
under the presidency of roh , the internal politics of south korea and its relations with the united states and north korea will require a total to nine . 
he will stay on the verge of maintaining security in the peninsula while remaining committed to america and with the support of his electorate ? 
reconciling these targets would be a difficult test for even the most experienced politician and the more cynical , let alone whether president roh can succeed is the divination . 
any failure , however , means the prospects so horrific that nobody can really wish him . 
each his path to peace 
over the next three weeks , the israeli army will do an exercise unprecedented : instead of defending the country against external enemies or terrorists , it will evacuate , by force if necessary , 9,000 israelis from their homes . 
the unilateral withdrawal of israel is the culmination of a deep political change caused by two convictions somewhat contradictory that have characterised the policies of prime minister ariel sharon since 2003 : first , that the " road map " initially launched by the united states is going nowhere , and then , that the status quo is untenable . 
for sharon , there is no doubt that the 9,000 jewish settlers living among 1,2 million palestinians in the gaza strip have no future . 
therefore , fault of negotiations , a unilateral withdrawal is the only sensible approach to the reduction of violence and stabilisation . 
this policy has deeply divided israel . the settlers , for the most religious , but not all , have felt betrayed by sharon , " the father of the settlements . " 
today is the israeli left which , although reluctant one realises that the new pragmatism preached by sharon is perhaps the first step in the right direction . 
just as de gaulle in algeria , sharon has redistributed maps of israeli policy . 
these last few weeks have been the framework of massive demonstrations , some nearing violence . number of settlers have declared that they do not follow the orders of evacuation . 
the army and the police have mobilized almost 50,000 troops to carry out evictions . 
this approach by force is traumatic not only for the settlers , but also for many other israelis . 
the next few days and weeks can only tell us if the evacuation happens peacefully or not . 
in the meantime , sharon has paid dearly for its policy . 
right-wing parties have left the coalition to power , it has lost its majority in his own likud party , and his finance minister , benjamin netanyahu , has left his government . 
it is only by inviting the labour party of shimon peres in his cabinet that sharon has managed to retain its parliamentary majority . 
the question is , of course , on the situation after the withdrawal from gaza . 
initially , this withdrawal left many governments sceptical , but they have come to realise , as we say in washington , that was the only thing to do . 
among them , as among the palestinians , some hope that after the withdrawal from gaza , it will be possible to return to the road map and to resume the negotiations which will lead to a final agreement between israel and the palestinians . 
this is a huge mistake . 
even if it is motivated by the best of intentions , hope to revive the road map is not realistic . 
future negotiations will have to deal with the issue of final borders between israel and palestine , the fate of 200,000 jewish settlers in the west bank , the status of jerusalem and the problem of the 1947-48 palestinian refugees . 
the chasm between the israeli and palestinian positions on these issues has not diminished since the failed negotiations to camp david in 2000 , while the fear and lack of trust have only grow . 
try to engage in negotiations in such circumstances would be not only a futile exercise , but could simply strengthen further remoteness and suspicion in the two camps . 
the failure of the annan plan for cyprus suggests that good intentions are not enough -- and the disagreements in cyprus were miniscule compared to what divides israelis and palestinians . 
that is it possible to do ? 
the only rational way to proceed is probably to recognise that the unilateral moves of each side can further promote the cause of the decline in violence and reconciliation final . 
on the israeli side , other withdrawals of dozens of small isolated settlements in the west bank , forcing the evacuation of 20,000 to 30,000 settlers , could prove politically feasible and would give the palestinians a contiguous territory in the west bank . 
on the palestinian side , the consolidation of control by the palestinian authority of a dozen security services and militias would be an important step forward . 
the palestinian leader , abu mazen , acknowledges , but the question is whether it is capable of . 
the palestinian authority could also engage on the difficult path to say the refugees that , contrary to what have said 50 years of palestinian propaganda , they do not return in israel , but will have to settle in the west bank and gaza , areas that will be part of the palestinian state . 
in an ideal world , the conflicts settle to strength of agreements and treaties . 
but in real life , as the examples of cyprus , bosnia and kosovo , the stabilisation and the slow decline in violence can sometimes achieve the same goal , even without formal agreement . 
the lack of plausible alternative , one can only hope that this will also be the case for the israelis and the palestinians . 
a new world ? 
berlin : as old horses fringants returning to sound the clarion , the strategists of the cold war , feel their rate of adrenalin increase while missile defence is up to the headlines . 
admittedly , the defence against missiles proposed by bill clinton ( reluctantly ) and george w. bush ( with enthusiasm ) -- and overwhelmingly supported by congress am√©ricain- does not look like the dream of war star done by ronald reagan 20 years ago : the missile defence programme ( nuclear missile defense ) , american missile defence system , nuclear is supposed to catch a modest number of warheads and does not a full protection against the missiles enemies . 
however the question revives the old debates about deterrence , of mutual assured destruction and nuclear arms control , and revived the rivalry between the nuclear powers at a time when nuclear weapons have lost much of their right to be . 
oddly , even though it is not certain that the missile defence programme to succeed , the debate is in full swing . 
and even if the system works , it will take between 10 and 15 years ago , perhaps more , before it is operational . 
also the words are mounting about something that , if there is one day , may have little impact . 
the governments normally cautious are taking their brands as if the future the expected at the corner of the wood . 
how to explain this strange behaviour ? 
certainly not by a blind faith in technology . 
after all , the history of missile defence is full of examples of technological disappointments for its supporters , that they are part of the government or not . 
no sane person cannot assume that what we have never managed before , destroy a small number of warheads in flight , is going to be a night . 
of the three tests which have been carried out so far , one has missed partially , the other two completely , this is the reason why the president clinton has preferred to pass the problem to his successor . 
if president bush , as he mentioned , practice now in favour of a new formula , it will be even more time to develop the architecture and design a programme of trial . 
and we cannot be sure it will work . 
governments are worried at the moment , not because of what will be possible or not , but about the intentions real or imagined of america . 
although the americans say loud and clear that the missile defence programme is not directed against anyone , that the only goal of the united states is to protect their citizens against states such as iraq or north korea , almost everybody is convinced the contrary : the russians fear that americans do not want to cement their military superiority ( and the inferiority of russia ) forever ; the chinese are afraid that the missile defence programme is a sign of america 's determination that taiwan remains independent , europeans fear that the plans of america do not create tensions with russia and between the united states of europe . 
because what is important is the political intentions and not technical capabilities , it is now that the missile defence programme creates problems : it is pushing russia to the confrontation , makes china nervous and strengthens a european sense of disunity with the us . 
the damage to begin as early as the starting line while the journey remains uncertain . 
the political consequences are further enhanced by the fact that , 30 years ago , the united states and the soviet union have renounced an effective defence against the strategic nuclear missiles . 
normally , a us defence project to the state of embryo , should not cause as much excitement that the missile defence programme . 
but the 1972 abm treaty banned , for an unlimited period , the systems designed to protect one or other of these two countries against such attacks . 
given the way the us proceed with the missile defence programme , they will have to violate the treaty or give a notice of six months to denounce , that the two signatories are entitled to do if they feel that it is their security vital . 
in the eyes of many , that would mean that america chooses to abandon the structure of nuclear arms control built during the last part of the cold war . 
the bush administration claims that , because the cold war is over , the formal disappearance of the abm treaty would not endanger the nuclear stability . 
but stability is as much a problem of perception policy of technical calculations . 
by limiting the anti-missile defence strategic , the old treaty offers some assurance of deterrence to the states have nuclear weapons . 
its disappearance would affect all the other agreements on the control of weapons . 
russia threat of all the tear if the us leave the abm treaty . 
even if this threat lack of credibility ( that would be damaging to the first russian interests ) , it is based on a certain logic . 
the main issue that raises the missile defence programme is not how to prepare for a world of anti-missile defence but how allay fears current policies . 
a few attempts are made quietly in the background . 
legal experts in washington suggest that moderate preparations for the construction of missile and radar sites do not violate the abm treaty and do not therefore forcing the us to denounce it . 
for the moment , the bush administration will await the results of tests before taking a decision . 
moscow and washington suggest all two that a deep reduction of their offensive nuclear arsenal is possible . 
the assurance that the us will participate in the deliberations makes the sceptics european allies more lenient . 
the most important measures designed to gain the trust , a modification of the abm treaty in order to allow a limited anti-missile defence is currently being studied . 
the " niet prior " russia will perhaps final . 
and political turmoil in which are dragged russia and europe subsides perhaps . 
but china ? 
she , she , is not part of an alliance ( as europe ) or a network of arms control treaty with which political solutions can be found ( such as russia ) , and this is one factor contributing to the instability of asia and the chinese nervousness . 
there , the trust can only be built on a rapprochement between china and the united states . 
unfortunately , there is nothing to indicate that washington was not made aware of the gravity of the problem . 
the old strategists of the cold war are very disappointed by this . 
so that they would review the vocabulary and abbreviations of the royal era of deterrence , they discover that he is a world away . 
the anti-missile defence threat not strategic stability between the us and russia but if it is poorly presented , it puts at risk the long term political vision . 
in announcing its determination to carry out a distant missile defence programme , the us has created a political turmoil which they must deal with now if we want to avoid the most damage . 
to avoid a lost generation 
everywhere , the young unemployed to the drift are a source of concern . 
they are especially a problem in developing countries which have a population explosion increasingly strong , the equivalent of the " baby boom' in the west at the end of the second world war . 
but the period that followed the war in most developed countries was an era of prosperity without precedent for the generation of the baby boom that is now approaching retirement . 
the future it will be as promising for the billion and a few young people aged 12 to 24 years of developing countries ? 
these countries should urgently combine investment and political measures to encourage young people to be trained , find work , remain healthy , start a family and exercise their citizenship . 
the benefit is considerable if they succeed : accelerated development thanks to the provision of a young population and the reduction in the rate of dependence . 
in east asia , this " d√©mographique' dividend would be at the root of most of the quarter of economic growth in the region . 
developing countries have already invested a lot in regard to the youngest . 
today , they are better educated and better health than previous generations . 
more than 80 % of the children go to primary school , up from 50 % in 1970 , and infant mortality has fallen from more than 10 % to 6,5 % over the same period . 
but governments must not just invest in favour of children , they must also begin to deal with the new generation of young people . 
however , in countries where the vast majority of children completing a primary education , few of them have access to secondary school . 
young people represent half of new cases of hiv infection . 
in the middle east and north africa , a quarter of young people are without work . 
all this raises difficult issues : what limits access to secondary education ? 
is it illiteracy remains high sometimes , even at the end of the primary , or the lack of resources ? 
why are there not more young people who know how to protect themselves against aids ? 
why companies in these countries plaignent-elles often about a lack of qualified workforce so that so many students find themselves unemployed at the exit of the university ? 
an effective policy in the direction of youth is based on three types of measures : more possibilities of success offered to young people , more skills and the offer of a second chance . 
governments must offer more chance of success to young people by improving access and quality health care and education . 
it is only in secondary education for pupils to take full advantage of primary education . 
yet , many young people are still unprepared to secondary school and squares are rare . 
employers want today of highly skilled workers . 
in countries as diverse as algeria , bangladesh , brazil , china , estonia and zambia , qualifications and inadequate training are barriers hardly franchissables . 
if we want to avoid that young people are stuck in jobs without any hope of promotion or are simply without employment , they must be able to enjoy a better education and training that meets the needs of businesses . 
several countries now trying to facilitate access to secondary education , particularly thanks to programmes of transferts' contingent , which will distribute benefits to the poor families whose children go to school regularly . 
these programmes have enabled us to increase the number of pupils at the secondary school in mexico , in ecuador , bangladesh and cambodia . 
but for these programmes have a purpose , it must be that students have the skills needed to enter secondary school . 
in morocco , for instance , more than 80 % of children are doing a first round of education , but less than 20 % reach the required standard . 
the measures are also necessary to help young people make good decisions . 
a government cannot replace the parents or the community , but it can encourage young people and their families to take charge . 
with the information it needed and a proper stimulus , young people will be better equipped to take decisions about their health or to their future . 
in cameroon , intended for young towns , a programme about the sexual hygiene , horizon young people , has helped to increase their knowledge of the matter and change their behavior . thus , the rate of young women of the use of condoms has risen from 58 % to 76 % in the group who has followed the programme . 
another example : in the dominican republic , the rate of inclusion in the high schools has increased when the pupils have been informed of the amount of wages of those who had reached the end of their secondary education , an amount that they had largely underestimated . 
in bangladesh , the project of assistance to the female secondary school has helped financially girls aged 11 to 14 years to continue their studies and delaying the time of marriage . 
governments should also offer a " second chance' to young people who have failed because of the circumstances or bad choice . 
the corresponding programmes must be well designed , properly targeted and coordinated way to provide adequate encouragement to its beneficiaries . 
thus , in sub-saharan africa , thousands of young fighters -- 100.000 in sudan alone -- hope to rebuild their lives for the time of peace , but they obviously have a need for education and employment , as well as medical and psychological support . 
with the political will , measures based on the efforts of the young people themselves to increase their chances of success and skills , and the offer of a second chance to those who need it , these countries could maximize their demographic advantage . 
they can seize this opportunity for growth to improve their prospects of development , either take the risk of a lost generation , aigrie by the lack of the future . 
the european paternalism 
the italian presidency of the european union is a huge responsibility to reinvigorate enlargement as key aspect of the new eu . 
the best place to start would be to encourage a better attitude towards the adoption of the euro for countries acceding to the union . 
in fact , the paternalistic position of eu institutions to the accession countries threatens to create a two-speed europe which will complicate the integration process . 
the accession countries have taken their share of the market in achieving the commercial integration with the countries of the union sometimes stronger than in many member countries . 
three of them --l' estonia , latvia and the lituanie-- have currency boards or a fixed exchange rate with the euro , as bulgaria , which must join the union in 2007 . 
the others have shown for several years their interest to adopt the euro at the start , in some cases unilaterally , even before entry into the eu -- a position openly supported by the national bank of poland , and to a lesser degree by the national bank of hungary and the national bank of the czech republic . 
however , despite their progress to bring their rate of inflation and interest rates closer to european levels , many candidate countries fear , with the full opening capital movements , prerequisites for accession to the eu , to be exposed to the risk of rulings brutal capital flows and crises cambiaires . 
they have learned the lessons of latin america and asia in the 1990s . 
the adoption of the euro would enable them very easily to escape to such risks and focus their efforts on the creation of real growth for their economies . 
however , the response of european institutions and especially the european central bank and the european commission was negative : the applicant countries entendirent argued that they must first spend two years in the european exchange rate mechanism ( erm ii ) , where aspiring to the euro had to prove what were able their policies . 
at the beginning , even systems board were considered unacceptable , although , as is often the case in europe , exceptions have been made : the country with the systems board could keep them even after their accession to the eu . 
the opposition of the ecb and the commission for an early adoption of the euro is misconceived . 
what should count for the european union remains that the policies of any member state are not harmful to the other member states . 
as the pointed out leszek balcerowicz , the governor of the national bank of poland , the adoption of the euro by the candidate countries creates certainly benefits for the candidate countries while being , in the worst case , absolutely no effect for the current members . 
indeed , the combined economic weight of all the candidates is far too weak -- only 6 % of gdp in the enlarged eu --pour exercise any effect on the euro . 
however , the opposition continues the institutions of the eu has led most of the candidates to abandon the idea to adopt the euro unilaterally , or as soon as possible after their entry into the european union . 
unfortunately , the stubbornness of the ecb and the commission now provide grist to the mill of the populist governments in countries homebuyers who rely on the variation of exchange rates to escape fiscal discipline that involves the adoption of the euro . 
however , such manoeuvres disqualifieraient tax probably a country wishing to enter quickly in the euro zone . 
in fact , the accession countries that have not put in place a system board have seen their budget deficits surge --d√©passant 9 % of gdp in hungary in 2002 and more than 5 % in poland , the czech republic and slovakia -- while large capital inflows have been putting pressure on their currencies to appreciate . 
this trend exposes the real economies of candidate countries to the risk of a reversal of capital flows and crises cambiaires that early adoption of the euro would eliminate . 
ironically , the candidates are lecture by officials from the ecb and the commission on the compromise between nominal convergence and real convergence . 
it would seem that the only imperative to brussels is the growth target of candidate countries , the macroeconomic stability can wait . 
large budget deficits support growth , and inflation is clearly not a problem . 
if this line of reasoning seems familiar , perhaps it is because it takes up more or less the foundations of the planning system is not sustainable by which the accession of candidate countries was suspended in the early 1990s . 
this was , of course , the adoption of economic policies focused on market forces in the former communist countries who brought the doors of eu membership . 
thus , the european institutions should drop their approach paternalistic and take seriously the concerns of the central banks of candidate countries about the risks related to the maintenance of their own currency over a long period during which their economy should open up completely capital movements . 
today , the ecb and the european commission support de facto the positions of the populist governments from eastern europe who already spend funds that they hope to achieve in the future of the part of the eu . 
it is high time that the european institutions address of more serious way the challenges and opportunities that present enlargement . 
they could start by considering the early adoption of the euro by the candidate countries of a more favourable , both for countries with a cash system than for those using a floating exchange rate . 
the european disaster of blair 
when french and dutch voters rejected the proposed european union constitution , everyone has quickly understood that the european project was in a difficult situation . 
the painful battle of last week on the future in the medium term of the budget of the union still has more confirmed the verdict . 
it has also sadly put an end to the british presidency of the european council , recalling that britain continues to maintain its old reputation of exception in the european union . 
the two facts are closely linked . 
in france and the netherlands , voters have not explained why they voted against the draft constitution . 
however , many commentators have believed that this vote expressed their protest against the admission perceived as precipitated the ten new member states , and especially the poorest countries of central and eastern europe . 
more particularly , it would seem that the voters have been afraid of losing their jobs , to the detriment of crowds of migrants from the east . this fear has been widely illustrated , at this time , by the image of the polish plumber cheap . 
the irony , of course , lies in the fact that most of the 15 old member states have refused to new countries entrants complete and immediate access to markets in the western employment . 
in any event , it was too late to protest since the ten countries were indeed become full members of the union . 
but now , the 25 member states must deal with the economic consequences of this expansion , not only on the question of the overall size of the european budget for the next seven years , but also on the distribution of contributing countries and beneficiaries . 
the key question is how the old member states are willing to pay to boost the economies late from new member countries . 
in fact , the battle took place on three fronts and has opposed britain , france and the new member states . 
traditionally , a large majority of the budget amounted to agriculture and the backward regions . 
in practice , huge amounts of money have been attributed to the big agricultural producers , either to the poorest member countries such as greece and portugal . 
these two levels , the new member states expected to benefit substantially the eu system . 
once , in budgetary terms , the big loser of the european mechanisms was the united kingdom . at the time that two thirds of the european spending amounted to agriculture , its agricultural sector was low and therefore , the british have little benefited european agricultural subsidies . 
for a long time , they have complained about the injustice of these rules , especially at this time , the united kingdom was one of the poorest member states . it is in 1984 that the conservative government of margaret thatcher demanded and got a massive rebate on the british net contribution to the eu budget . 
today , the situation has changed in three key points . first , the reform of european agricultural policy has begun and the proportion of european agricultural budget has fallen from 60 to 40 % . 
then , it is many years that britain has a faster economic growth that most of the other member states so that it has become one of the richest countries in the eu and this , even in comparison with france and germany . finally , the new member states are so poorer than the poorest of the old member states that they have a moral argument weight to ask a generous portion of the budget negotiated , whatever it is . 
the start of negotiations , six months ago , coincides with the start of the british presidency of the european council . 
tony blair , the british prime minister , has galvanized politicians by declaring before the european parliament in brussels that it was " passionately pro-european " . 
that was the message that the british pro-europeans hoped for a long time and that they expected in vain since the election of tony blair in 1997 . 
of course , it has never expressed such a feeling inside britain , over the last eight years . 
in addition , since britain has been one of the strongest advocates of enlargement to the countries of central and eastern europe , we would have expected in the budget negotiations , the government of blair is proportionately so generous that excited to new entrants . 
initially , this seemed to be the tactics adopted by the british government . 
but against all odds , it has adopted a position ethically advantageous in proposing to give up part of his budget rebate , only on condition that the rest of the european union ( and france , in particular ) agrees about the fundamental reforms in terms of european agricultural policy . 
it took time for the british understand that since president jacques chirac was a beleaguered president unsound and remaining at the elys√©e until 2007 , but without owning no power , it did not have the resources to endorse such a bargaining . 
once the british have become aware of this harsh reality , they have played their lamentable last card in the management of the negotiations . they have made offers petty and ridiculous , all mainly designed to safeguard the small british interests and , essentially , to the detriment of the new member states . 
what sad conclusion for a presidency opened with great fanfare , six months ago by the statements passionately pro-european of tony blair ! 
the full text of his speech is unambiguous . 
blair is in favour of europe , but not to it . 
he wants to be part of a political europe , but only if the other member states agree to follow the model of economic and social reform british . 
the problem is that economic and social reform is purely and simply a matter of national policy and is not part of the powers of the union . if such a reform was to have taken place in france or germany , this issue would be exclusively discussed between politicians and the french or german . 
it could only be included in the powers of the union on condition that the eu will become a real federation . 
can you say blair that it is federalist , then ? 
of course not ! 
it is above all a nationalist reckless who lives in fear of the furtive tablo√Øde press of his country . 
why , then , so he said his pro-european fervor ? 
maybe he ultimately not thought about the issue . 
europe the challenge of neoliberalism 
for more than 20 years , i argued that the high rate of unemployment of western europe could not persist . 
at the end of the 1970s , monetarists bet that only a transitory and modest increase in unemployment could contain creeping inflation - and open - of the industrial west , and that the cost of a return to effective price stability would have been worth it . 
in britain and the united states , this bet monetarist has had a happy ending . 
not in western europe . 
over the last 25 years , european unemployment has risen to measure that monetary policy is tended and that interest rates were increased to fight inflation . 
but when inflation has succumbed , unemployment has not fallen , or almost not . 
if the rate of unemployment has not reached the levels of the great depression , it remained high enough to make the long-term unemployment , or the fear of unemployment in the long term , a shocking experience . 
the governments of the companies in which the official unemployment rate remains at 10 % or more for several generations have a bad economic management . 
as a result , it seemed to me for 20 years that the balance underlying the policy in western europe -- collective bargaining and ample social insurance , on the one hand , and tight monetary policies of the other , was condemned to creak . 
european policymakers seem paralysed by a double fear . 
central bankers europe fear that their political masters their command to relax monetary policy , the structural reforms needed to unlock the aggregate offers are not granted and that the result is a return to inflation of the 1970s . 
in short , they fear that all the sacrifices made to stabilise prices have been in vain . 
politicians in western europe , for their part , fear the opposite effect . 
they worry that even after structural reforms aimed at reducing the attractiveness of unemployment insurance and motivate workers so that they are going to companies , and companies to the workers , the central bankers will continue to insist to tighten the purse-strings . 
in short , they fear that without increasing the production or employment , the net effect will simply be that an increase of poverty . 
of course , these fears are accompanied by the hope that the structural reforms and monetary expansion work in harmony , provoking a boom in employment and production without causing sizeable increase in inflation . 
but the reality is that no step towards the loosening of monetary policies have been put in place , especially with the european central bank d√©butante , anxious to establish its credibility in the fight against inflation -- and that attempts to structural reforms are hesitant , and small . 
i am led astray for 20 years ago : the systems of western europe have remained stable despite the exclusion of a large proportion of citizens of a real involvement in economic life . 
the growth of the economies of the countries of western europe has continued , despite the heavy burden of 10 % of unemployed , but not as quickly as it could . 
today , it seems that i finally have reason , if not panic , at least concern to me . 
the french have rejected the european constitution , above all ( at least according to appearances ) , because a greater european integration , are they afraid , would result in its wake the enormous costs and the disruption of neoliberalism . 
it is one thing to support the " european project " when it comes to link germany and france so closely that nobody thinks useful to make war to determine what language should be spoken in alsace-lorraine . 
it is another when the european project means that the french workers will face competition from polish plumbers , romanian farmers and sellers turks . 
in germany , voters seem to evict chancellor gerhard schroeder , because his allegiance lukewarm to the neo-liberal project their dislike . 
the problem is that they may find themselves governed for four years by angela merkel , a chancellor almost as attached to the neo-liberal than me . 
i believe that germany would do better , in ten years , with more neoliberal policies . 
but that does not appear to match the desire of the german electorate , which makes absolutely unpredictable the aspect of german politics in four years . 
moreover , the discontent of northern europe towards the central bankers , particularly of the ecb and the euro . 
not that the end of the european monetary union is decided , but it is simply that some have begun to consider a dark future where the end of emu would be put on the agenda . 
which is enough to rattle the prices of assets around the world . 
the successes of western europe since the second world war are among the most impressive and the more encouraging success of the history of the world . 
everyone should hope that united europe today build on these successes , rather than see generations of high rates of unemployment put them in danger . 
for this , the attitude of the ecb will have to change . 
europe needs a monetary policy given that the unemployment rate fell in northern europe is more important than the price stability of the continent . 
the south and east of europe will suffer inflation , it is imperative , because regions develop and industrialize , the terms of the exchange improve , and under the auspices of a monetary union , the regional inflation may be a step to take . 
the ecb should not try to balance inflation in the south and east with deflation of the north for artificial reaching targets across the entire continent . 
rescued by taxes 
what are we owe our arri√®res-arri√®res-arri√®res grandchildren ? 
what measures should we take today to reduce the risks posed to our descendants and to our planet by the increasing likelihood of global warming and climate change ? 
almost everyone -- with the exception of exxon mobil , us vice president dick cheney , of their paid servants and deluded acolytes -- understands that when humans burn hydrocarbons , carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere , where it acts like a giant coverage which absorbs the infrared radiation emitted above , warming the planet . 
similarly , almost everyone understands that the warming of the planet could be more serious , is less serious than the existing models suggest it , but that this uncertainty is not an excuse for doing nothing . 
in fact , rather , it should prompt us to better protect ourselves if we knew that global warming will be exactly according to the projections medium-sized . 
finally , almost everyone agrees that the governments , the nonprofit institutions and oil companies should spend much more money for research on energy technologies without emitting carbon , or able to remove the pollutants from the atmosphere and oceans and so cool the planet by sending more solar radiation . 
it is clear that the rich who must bear the burden of solving the problem of climate change over the next few generations . 
after all , they were able to access industrialisation and wealth in blithely pollutant . 
today , china , india and other developing countries do not have this latitude and it would be unfair to penalise them . 
it is now time to build , not dismantle or undermine , international institutions who will have to manage our response to climate change in the coming years . 
but do we need to do something else now and during the next decade ? 
economists like to think in terms of cost . 
and when they see a behavior having destructive side effects , they like the tax . 
the tax is forcing people to feel the damage they cause where it hurts -- the wallet . 
impose a tax on those who drive the 4x4 in the city , for example , is a way to encourage collective intelligence to decide that the adverse side effects are a good reason to change its behavior . 
but it must be a tax right . 
an suv who travels 17 miles into town and which consumes 3,7 litres of petrol rejected nearly 3 pounds carbon in the atmosphere . 
the tax " greenhouse effect " should be of 0,010 euros , or $ 0,38 1,15 a gallon ? 
this choice will be determined by what we learn over the years , but today , the amount of the tax depends on a philosophical question : how much do we think duty to our distant descendants ? 
the australian economist john quiggin has an illuminating discussion on his website ( 
on the other hand , critics point out that the world today is poor . average annual gdp , purchasing power parity , stands at about ‚Ç¨ 5 . 
one expects that the improvement of technologies and their spread to make the world a much richer in 2100 : with annual growth of 2 percent , it will be almost ‚Ç¨ 40.000 per head in terms of purchasing power of 2006 . 
these critics believe so we have a lot more need today this marginal expenditure of ‚Ç¨ 55 that individuals rich 2100 will need ‚Ç¨ 400 they would gain by being protected from the effects of climate change . 
but what the critics often fail to mention is that the same logic applies to the world . 
average annual per capita incomes are currently around ‚Ç¨ 30.600 in the us , japan and western europe and less than $ 6 , 000 for the poorer half of the globe . 
the same logic that we need more of ‚Ç¨ 55 today that the people of 2100 will need additional ‚Ç¨ 400 wants the rich should be taxed more , since each additional ‚Ç¨ 380 in taxes in rich countries are reflected by an increase in income per head of 55 euros in poor countries . 
in other words , if the rich are miserly today for our descendants more rich and if we decide to allow them to cope with an ecological disaster , we must now be generous with the poor of this world . 
conversely , if we are greedy , today to the poor , we need to be generous with our descendants . 
at least that is what we should do if our actions are based more on moral principles on the leitmotif of leonid brezhnev 's : " what we have taken , we bear . " 
take pharmacovigilance seriously 
the health threats -- nuclear reactors , firearms , and contaminated foods -- threaten all of us , that is why the governments are playing an active role in the limit , through regulations often successful . 
however , the situation is very different when it comes to the safety of prescription drugs . 
in fact , for the regulator , pharmacovigilance is the poor relation of the public protection . 
the scope of the problem is enormous . 
in the united states alone , it is estimated that every year the side effects are responsible for the death of 100 000 patients . 
if these figures are proven , it means that the deaths caused by drugs rank fourth or fifth leading cause of death ( according to estimates on mortality used ) . 
in addition , the direct annual hospital costs due to adverse effects will run into billions of dollars , and this is not to mention the suffering caused by the secondary effects that do not lead to hospitalization ( or die ) . 
the difficulties to determine the causes and effects should be taken into account . 
it is sometimes difficult to know whether the death or hospitalization of a patient is attributable to a particular drug , disease treated or the association of the two . 
this phenomenon is that stress the need to ensure the safety of medicines . 
the fact that all medicines , in addition to their profits , produce undesirable effects among some patients is one of the reasons to be pharmacovigilance . 
there is a need to weigh carefully the beneficial effects and unwanted medicines before the approved and use . 
these judgments vary , depending on whether they are issued by a pharmaceutical company , which expects the benefits of its sales , or by a patient who could suffer a serious side effect . 
the unfinished nature of complicating knowledge that estimate . 
the rush to put new drugs on the market often leads to an incomplete research on their safety . 
more than half of medicines approved causes a serious side effect unknown at the time of its marketing authorisation . 
one example : when the new class of painkillers called parp cox-2 was put on the market , regulators , doctors and patients ignored that these drugs could cause heart attacks and strokes . 
tens of thousands of patients innocent people , perhaps more , have suffered from those side effects before the withdrawal of the first two drugs in this class . 
it is difficult to provide a complete list and appropriate the harmful effects of medicines . 
the rate of spontaneous alerts to the regulatory agencies is low , about 1 % , and the controls are passive in many countries . 
it must also rely on the general reluctance to report the side-effects of drugs . 
doctors sometimes feel guilty and fear the trial , and pharmaceutical companies worry about threats to their profits . the regulatory agencies about they must confront the question " why this drug he has been allowed ? " 
it is particularly difficult to allocate an undesirable effect to a drug when the symptom is common in the age group the user or the disease treated . 
as the risk of heart attacks is important for the elderly , many of whom suffer from pain related to arthritis requiring treatment of painkillers , it took six years to make the link between parp cox-2 and multiplication by two or three of the risks of heart attacks . 
a recent survey harris survey in the united states concluded that 60 % of adults are not confident at all , not be very convinced that drug makers to disclose information about the adverse effects of their products . 
this scepticism is justified : internal documents obtained during recent trials show that pharmaceutical companies often declined to submit information criticism in terms of security to the regulatory agencies , as the law , and fail to communicate this information to doctors and patients . 
one of the problems is that the consequences of this neglect of the harmful effects of medicines are non-existent or minimal . 
it is time to be serious : 
¬∑ citizens and governments must make pharmacovigilance a priority , and commit the necessary resources to solve the problem . 
¬∑ the penalties for pharmaceutical companies that fails to point out and communicate the information on the safety of their medicines should be increased significantly to an effective deterrent . 
¬∑ control agencies must have the resources to enforce the laws for stricter rules are implemented . 
¬∑ the problem of pharmacovigilance must be seen as a failure of the system . 
it is not fair to blame the serious adverse effects to doctors , particularly in the absence of comprehensive information on the safety of medicines . 
the full cooperation of doctors is essential to tackle the problem , but it means that we must put an end to their fear of ending up in court . 
this approach works well in the aviation industry : the pilots who are reporting the mistakes they have threatened to make are not penalised . 
¬∑ patients must be better informed about the risks of drugs they are prescribed on prescription and more involved in their detection and their reporting . 
the instructions printed in tiny letters are unnecessary . 
¬∑ control undesirable effects should be more proactive . 
this request more money , which should come from the main beneficiaries of the sale of medicines : the pharmaceutical industry , in the same way that the monitoring of air safety is funded by the airlines . 
above all else , improving pharmacovigilance will depend , if we want the efforts are successful , the establishment of an independent office intended to promote , coordinate and give indications of the programme of regulation . 
that office is in the uk . 
other governments should follow this model in order to fulfil their role , neglected so far , guardian of public health . 
the virtual enemy 
five years have passed since the terrorist attacks of september 2001 on new york and washington , and yet it seems that the decision-makers have hardly learned about the workings of the terrorist cells and their weaknesses . 
the bush administration is still using the term " war against terrorism " and behaves as if it was really a war of usual type when a government in fight another . 
however , after five years of efforts , the military strategies based on the targeting of a single opponent have only made the situation worse . 
it is time to understand the new model of conflict emerging . 
for the paradigm " war " works , the bush administration referred to al-qaeda as an enemy . 
in reality , there is no great organiser or financing terrorist activities . 
the attacks in madrid , bali , and london , as well as several attempts uncovered in the united states and britain , were all characterised by their organisation dispersed . 
it is plots generated independently who have used the resources of ad hoc , often inside the country . 
these small operations also were a common internal pattern . 
the terrorist motivations differ from cell to cell , even from person to person . 
individuals can be motivated by profit or the thirst for power , or for political reasons and religious , while other act by hatred or for the big chill . 
in addition , there are big differences in terms of the risk , of rewards and imperatives as you climb the chain organisational or that you move from one cell to another . 
the conventional military models are equipped to decapitate a thing which , in this case , has no head . 
the characteristics of this new structure have already been studied in a very different context . 
terrorism is the violent version of a " virtual company agile . " 
a virtual company is a small group who together all alone in organisation just large enough to implement a collective intention . 
the virtual companies are unusually innovative and in the business sector , they are probably the only system capable of creating an effective single product . 
the industry of film production is a glaring example . 
in fact , it is without doubt the business model of the future . 
the benefits virtual businesses from their lightness in terms of stability . 
at the moment , the largest part of the price of a product finance the enormous and ineffective organisation which has assembled . 
almost all the creativity and the resolution of problems are happening in small businesses and are " integrated " later by large companies , including the infrastructure is expensive and fragile , and that retains most of the profits . 
this model is the basis of the business world of today , just as the centralisation was privileged defence strategy . 
when you buy a car to general motors , 80 cents of every dollar spent back to gm , which manages almost alone . 
small suppliers you actually provide 80 % of the value and innovation , but only receive 20 % of the reward . 
ironically , the in-depth research on alternative models have been funded by the us department of defence , which , as the biggest buyer of complex machinery of the world , wanted to goods better , cheaper and more on measure . 
the research found the conditions and the trigger mechanisms necessary to facilitate the constitution autonomous small groups opportunistic and to allow them to behave as large companies . 
unfortunately , the research programme has been cancelled before its findings may not apply to the business world , probably because it threatened to large companies . 
it is often forgotten that defense secretary donald rumsfeld has abandoned a comfortable retirement to reorganise the us army in a force smaller and more agile , using some of these same ideas . 
but the organisation of the invasion of iraq , why rumsfeld had recommended the use of fewer troops than expected , shows a poor understanding of the systems distributed . 
while the troops were deployed in the aim of an entry and a flexible withdrawal , the bush administration ends up using them for an occupation . 
the terrorists have shown a talent greatest to capitalize on the models of operations distributed . 
the crowds of texts appear in the muslim world on the strategic studies of jihad . 
the most famous in the west is the management of savagery [ the management of the brutality ] , but only because it was translated and made public . 
these books ( and trends that they indicate ) become less dogmatic and increasingly complex in terms of adoption modern techniques of management . 
their research include surely the young science of management of the virtual company : how to feed and support auto-organis√©es cells . 
the first lesson for western decision makers , perhaps , is that virtual companies rely on a culture of trust . 
certain kinds of confidence can be based on a concept of artificial " not we " rather than on real values and direct experience . 
it is for this reason that the actions of the bush administration only reinforce the dynamics of the virtual company terrorist . 
bush 's rhetoric , " us and them " clearly defines an " other " and stand as a cohesive enemy . 
his approach " war " aid islamic terrorists to consider the west as a force as united and malicious . 
in the future , the model of the virtual company will shape the way will be conducted business , which will be delivered the wars and probably the way government services will be administered . 
it promises to separate the management of the finances of the production , involving innovations and more rapid economic growth . 
however , if western governments do not develop a deep understanding of how to operate these structures , they have no chance to combat terrorist enterprise agile . 
the expansion as a solidarity 
nowadays , it is often said that the sense of solidarity of the european union has been put at risk , not to say that he has completely exploded , by enlargement to the countries of central and eastern europe . 
bulgaria and romania closer to turn the entry into the eu , and the negotiations to open up with turkey and croatia , it has become essential to question this idea . 
the values and interests of the new members of the european union more often coincide with those of the first 15 members . 
it is true , of course , that enlargement has fundamentally changed the union and given birth to new problems and political issues . 
however , the new member states in central and eastern europe are deeply embedded in the economic , social and cultural development of our continent . 
the ties that bind us have been eroded by 40 years of soviet domination , but this has not changed fundamentally the european nature of these states . 
my country , poland , has always had a profound cultural links with other european countries , particularly france . 
we have participated in all the major european developments in the field of music , literature and cinema ( with , for example , andrzej wajda films of the era 's solidarity , such as " danton , " a french co-production ) . 
in sport , too , the east europeans are integrated for a long time to the rest of europe . 
indeed , before the first world war , the national team of german football was entirely composed of players to the polish surnames . 
but , above all , there is a deep sense among poles , hungarians and the czechs , and others , who feel all europeans . 
what is the real sense of the word " solidarity " such as the dictionary defines the small robert : " relationship between people with a sense of a community of interest " . 
solidarity as the sense of a unit resulting from common interests are also clear within the 15 members of origin that members of the enlarged union today . 
the exceptions prove the rule . 
the lack of unity within the european union on the iraq issue should not be overshadowed the agreements that the member states have agreed on all other important issues in terms of international affairs . 
for the economic issues , the disagreements on a single regulation of the european union , for example , should not conceal the fact that no member state , new or historical , has never contested the community market . 
finally , the enlargement process itself is obviously a symbol of european unity civil social and cultural . 
the fact that it provoked debate and discussion does not contradict the conviction shared by all , old and new member states , that they have obligation to rebuild a continent after 40 years of division . 
remain a few questions which , if they are not fundamental source of division , are worrying . 
should we fear the fact that europe is no longer today a continent judaeo-christian purely and white ? 
the citizens of the european union whose origins are in other continents and whose religion is islamic , hindu , sikh , buddhist or be able to identify with the values and culture " european " ? 
will it be able to feel european as has always been the poles or czechs ? 
these questions are especially valuable , in fact , they cannot be avoided in the case of the possible of turkey 's accession to the european union . 
european integration is driven by the respect of the values of others ? 
is it the share or contribute to it ? 
these are burning questions . 
they are particularly difficult if we consider culture as the cement the future of europe . 
all european countries probably thought from the beginning that new entrants not europeans would be treated in the same way that the polish immigrants were assimilated german in the ruhr in the 19th century . 
the fact that this is not happened , at least on a large scale , does not mean that this must not happen . 
there is only to see the number of respectable citizens of turkish origin living in germany . 
or the large number of britons indians and pakistanis of second generation that we see now in suit tie with laptop to the hand , always between two aircraft . 
europeans must admit , however , that these individuals only represent a minority . 
number of immigrant groups in europe are themselves rejected by their communities the fact of the impossible social and economic integration . 
the constant threat of terrorism has made the insulation of islamist populations of europe even more dramatic . 
the european union simply cannot say the " solidarity " as a central value and do nothing to promote among those who feel marginalized . 
they must be allowed to feel this " relationship between people with a sense of a community of interest " . 
european solidarity may not survive this neglect and did not survive . 
after kyoto 
the treaty of the kyoto protocol is now come into force for the 126 nations that have signed to this day . 
it is now time to start questioning the following point : how to bring all nations , including the large emitters , to discuss what to do after the treaty expires in 2012 ? 
that is exactly what has recently made the european commission as he unveiled his first strategy for a post-kyoto era , which will be discussed by the european council in march . 
while the kyoto protocol represents only a modest reduction of carbon emissions in industrialized countries ( 5,2 % between 2008 and 2012 compared to 1990 levels , with varying targets the countries ) real progress can be made by supporting development efforts and preserving our planet . 
but first , all countries must integrate the climate concerns in the planning of their policies and improve their governance in key sectors such as energy , infrastructure and transport . 
in other words , we must act by being aware that climate change and its effects on the inhabitants of rich and poor countries remain a threat to world security . 
in the end , the long-term approach , probably will include a system based on rules , a system of incentives and investments at the level of technological change . 
the adaptation at national level will be increasingly recognised as a major issue which will require adequate funding . 
the treatment of the effects of climate change and the treatment of emissions reductions should not exclude one another , but be complementary . 
consider the post-kyoto world gives us the chance to start a new dialogue and to consider the new options on climate change . 
the nations could establish a more ambitious goal which would be to limit the change on the long term the temperature of the earth , then to allocate emissions rights between the countries in such a way to limit ultimately temperature increases to an acceptable level . 
that would need to increase investment in research and development on energy in order to develop new technologies and best , a process that must be supported by more solid partnerships between the public and private sectors . 
so far , with only 15 % of the world 's population , the rich countries are responsible for more than 75 % of global emissions of carbon dioxide ( co2 ) , and thus most of the damage to the environment . 
this , however , are developing countries ( and therefore the poor countries of the world ) who are the most vulnerable . 
it is unrealistic to ask to poor countries , where more than 1,6 billion people do not have access to clean energy and technologies , to bear the costs associated with the much needed technological change . 
in conjunction with its partners , the world bank supports financial strategies designed to help developing countries to settle the costs due to climate change . 
so far , more than $ 1 billion invested in projects gef ( global environment facility - funds for the global environment ) and about $ 8 billion placed in the co-financing , have been engaged in programmes related to climate change . 
while the regulatory mechanisms of kyoto and of the european system of emissions negotiable ( european trading scheme ) have contributed to the creation of an emerging market for trade carbon , the interested parties are now worried about the immediate future . 
without regulatory framework after 2012 , the new possibilities of beginnings of transactions based on projects will end by 2006 / 2007 . 
given the long period between the preparation of the projects , and the first benefits of emissions reductions , the project developers have only a few years before them to act before the payments of carbon is continuing to make a significant contribution to the financing of projects in the current context . 
the development of projects related to the infrastructure is a long process that requires between 3 and 7 years , identification via the granting of licences , financing , and the construction , until the first certification of reductions in carbon emissions . 
the projects must therefore be operational at the latest by 2007 . 
the world bank has contributed to move the financing of carbon as a tool of sustainable development and to facilitate the participation of the private sector in the market . 
the bank is focused on the representation of the interests of its countries borrowers , helping them to develop assets for the carbon trade according to their own priorities . 
but without commitment of governments to limit emissions of greenhouse gases beyond 2012 , the carbon market will remain uncertain and the private sector ( essential to the success of the market ) should not extend its participation significantly and sustainable . 
according to a recent study supported by the world bank on companies interested in the financing of carbon , only a society on five surveyed said that it was interested in emissions reductions after 2012 . 
the opportunity arises now to look to the future and mobilise the world community ( all countries without exception , albeit with different responsibilities ) in the search for a safer world , a world that would prevent the terrible risks , environmental degradation and social conflict involved by inaction . 
state of the art or art of the state ? 
september is traditionally the month when the orchestras and opera companies leave the festivals of aachen , salzburg , tanglewood and many other home . 
this session is also marked ( on both sides of the atlantic ) by the return of concerns about the means of financing of classical music . 
life american symphony is eurocentriste under almost all its aspects , except for its funding . 
while the americans rely on private donations tax deductible and revenue to finance displays of classical music , europeans prefer a direct government support . 
ironically , while the defenders of the arts in the united states have long called for the adoption of the " european model , " which has produced a rich and varied artistic life , europe is forced to change course and to guide its system of support towards greater dependence on private money and revenue . 
unfortunately , the european system of direct government funding is a victim of european economic growth slow and budget deficits . 
the problem is especially for the countries that have adopted the euro , as public spending in the arts will be limited during a time by the obligation to keep the deficit below 3 % of gdp . 
the pressure on the european institutions performing arts causes concern on several levels . 
traditionally , the european social democracies prefer to distribute goods and services rare as concerts and operas to a system of tails ( financed by huge subsidies to keep low prices ) rather than by the willingness of each to pay . 
this will now change . 
the defenders of performing arts in europe point the finger at the united states where , among others , even great conductors must participate actively in research funding and play an active role in the local community on behalf of the orchestra . 
they fear that the same thing erupted in europe . 
some conductors , refusing to handle the bowl at the same time as the stick , have rejected important posts in the united states for this reason , believing that it would thwart their art . 
it is said that daniel barenboim has left the chicago symphony orchestra in part because he objected to the fundraising demands expected of him . 
but the american experience shows that use of big names in the field of art , as the conductors , to participate in the collection of funds , does not necessarily in the artistic aspect of the job . 
michael tilson thomas in san francisco , for example , has combined collection of funds effective and artistic direction to propel the san francisco symphony at the summit of north american orchestras . 
the europeans , worried about the idea that greater dependence on private money to mean a conservative programming , should also be reassuring to see that the san francisco symphony has one of the most audacious repertoires of the united states . 
if the public has tastes progressives , private money and innovative programming are entirely compatible . 
the corollary is that public money makes possible an adventurous programming even if the taste of the public tends to be conservative . 
this is one of the reasons why artists in europe like public money ; he unleashes an exclusive regime , beethoven and mozart . 
in addition , the public can come to appreciate a repertoire adventurous to force that he proposes . 
of course , if the public purse are reduced for the performing arts , not only do they have to be more dependent on private money , but the price of places will increase . 
some regret , and prefer the system of tail for obtaining tickets because they fear that higher tariffs do not jeopardise the public future excluding the young . 
but low prices for the performing arts do not solve the thorny problem of access of young people . 
first of all , the young may not benefit from the cheap seats simply because whatever the price , classical music is of no interest to them . 
then , even if they want to go there , it is sometimes impossible to obtain places , which are often more available because subscriptions remain between the same hands year after year . 
what is the point of having low prices , which are predominantly used to subsidise the same holders of subscriptions , if there are no seats ? 
if the taste for classical music must be subsidized , it must encourage better targeted subsidies rather than low prices . 
the best way to attract youth to the performing arts is through education . 
given that the orchestras americans cannot count on schools or the government to provide the basic music education needed to ensure a constant public to classical music , some orchestras are themselves with private money . 
in san francisco , for example , the symphony runs a project called keeping score , funded with private funds to the tune of $ 23 million , which includes a national television series of radio broadcasts , an interactive learning music and school music programs . 
this type of programme innovative applies as much to european orchestras that americans . 
the problem of youth and access to the performing arts exists on both sides of the atlantic . 
just as the poor quality of the music education to the state school . 
if the orchestras do not care about their own future , they may simply not be . 
respect for the law , to the russian 
everywhere in the world , we are concerned about the disappearance of political freedoms in russia vladimir putin . 
the russians themselves are practically the only ones not to worry about this creeping authoritarianism . 
they seem less concerned about the political freedoms that by social protection : pensions , domestic violence , rights of the child or police brutality . 
in reality , most russians are indifferent to the efforts by the government to restrict the freedom of the press and the right to protest . 
this apathy makes my job as a mediator , an institution in the duma ( parliament ) to protect the political rights in russia , difficult or impossible . 
the ombudsman serves as a bridge between the authorities and the people ; it is trying to resolve the conflicts between the organs of the state to citizens . 
my office is open not only to the russian citizens , but also to foreign nationals and stateless persons who believe that their political rights have been threatened . 
we apply the russian constitution , but also the principles of international law and human rights standards , sometimes even in contradiction with our constitution . 
for example , as a mediator , i am opposed to the restriction of the right of russians to be juries . 
those who wanted to limit the use of feared juries supposedly for national security . 
my office has worked closely with the state to ensure that most of the trials are held with jury . 
similarly , my office has defended the liberal weekly novoe vremya , subject to pressure by the city of moscow on the pretext of a commercial dispute concerning a lease . 
the dispute is not resolved , but due to my speech the moscow authorities are forced to take account of the negative attitude of the public in their attempts to censor this newspaper . 
of course , russia offers examples of problems relating to the fundamental political freedoms and much more to the fore , as the dirty war in chechnya or the yukos affair . 
my office is as much as possible of chechnya , although it is not easy for moscow . 
i could spend all my time , but russia account 89 regions and countless human rights problems to solve . 
that is why i have suggested to putin that chechnya to have its own regional mediator , on place permanently . 
the new chechen authorities seem to be welcomed . 
as regards the yukos affair , my office cannot intervene in any legal process underway . 
lawyers for the former director general of yukos , mikhail khodorkovsky , complained to the european court of human rights in strasbourg . 
if khodorkovsky contesting the final decision of the russian courts , it will no doubt appeal before this jurisdiction . 
this is only at this point that i be able to give my opinion . 
many observers point out , however , that the people that are the subject of a criminal investigation should be released on bail and not imprisoned . 
for others , it is not possible in the case of khodorkovsky : it is very rich and could thus easily escape justice and flee abroad . 
that is precisely what made the other individuals accused in the yukos affair . 
all these problems in the field of human rights highlight the unfinished nature of russian legal institutions . 
for example , the duma has put too much time to adopt legislation on the pressure groups , which in most democracies developed clearly defines the behaviour acceptable and unacceptable . 
khodorkovsky might not have so much trouble if such laws existed . 
but the absence of legislation is directly linked to the absence of clear ideas . 
human rights in russia are often flouted simply because the people do not know they have these rights . 
the most important objective for my office is that everyone learns to better defend their rights , and that the authorities are taking into account the complaints of ordinary russians . 
unfortunately , most bureaucrats despise the values of human rights . 
but the real difficulty for my office is not ignorance or legal loopholes : it is the fact that in a legal system inadequately developed such as russia , my authority is essentially personal , and requires the support of the media . 
the notions of human rights is still rudimentary , we can best hope a realization that gradually spread . 
my strategic objective is to make a better understanding of the ombudsman 's office , in order to get more respect and recognition of the citizens and the state . 
it is almost impossible without cooperation with non-governmental organisations of human rights in russia . 
i believe that one of my tasks is to encourage contacts between these groups and the authorities . 
the government 's response to these initiatives will better whether and to what extent the putin government intends to include the political and human rights in the context of his " dictatorship of the law . " 
the pope conservative revolutionary 
twenty-five years ago , the polish people has surprised that one of them , cardinal karol wojtyla of krakow , has been appointed to the papacy . 
some people are frightened , others have shed tears of joy . 
here , as a famous writer , " the second baptism of poland . " 
but even in our euphoria , we did not expect that the new pope is changing far not only poland , but the world . 
his first visit to his home country shortly after his inauguration has shown the world the power of the new pope . 
the communist police has disappeared from the main streets of warsaw , the streets have become models of order . 
after decades of deprivation of their autonomy , the poles have suddenly regained their ability to self-determination . 
by saying out loud that " there can be no europe without an independent poland on the card , " the pope has managed to sweep the colonisation unfair post-war had permeated poland to soviet power . 
then , at auschwitz , the pope said : " i speak on behalf of all those whose rights are unknown and trampled in the world , i am talking about because i am connected , we are all linked by the truth . " 
has this place , in this golgotha of modern times , he has called the poles who remembered their families gaz√©es in the cr√©matoire of auschwitz , as well as those frozen in the concentration camps in siberia , a fraternity devoted to combating hatred and revenge , even justified . 
some see the pope as the man who caused a religious revival ; others take for a man of peace . 
some see him as a defender of the poor , others a criticism of the liberation theology . 
for the people of poland , john paul ii , doing human rights the focal point of his teaching , will be forever the man who gave us the courage and hope , who has restored historic our identity . 
indeed , during the first decade of his reign , the pope has put all its efforts in the fight against the dictatorship , and particularly the communist dictatorship . 
the strategy made by the pope to the catholic church and its ability to mobilise millions of believers to his cause meant that no one can never repeat the question posed by stalin : " how many divisions the pope there ? " 
john paul ii has shown that the moral strength is a weapon powerful enough to undo the division of the world created in yalta . 
perhaps in part because of their strong position anti-communist , the catholic church and john paul ii often receive the label of " conservatives " . 
this accusation suggests that the church cannot coexist easily with a pluralist democracy . 
it is true that in the fight against communism , the church has been polish rather conservative , thank god ! 
it has been conservative in its absolute loyalty to the evangelicals , values to the truth of the faith , to its historical identity . 
for a system which advocated atheism official and the lie legalised , the church has represented a reproach alive . 
however , with the demise of communism , the problem encountered by john paul ii and his church at the moment is the following : in what language the evangelical values can be expressed in a world in which the evil is not represented by a political system , but is present in every soul ? 
what is the message of the pope for the post-communist world that he has helped to create ? 
john paul ii undoubtedly keeps its distance with the liberal ideas and liberal state , he often tax of permissiveness and moral relativism . 
the pope 's statements are often marred a criticism of individualism in the name of the values collective . 
he considers the flaws of liberalism as particularly pernicious in post-communist countries . 
the market economy , despite its successes practices , often seems , in his eyes , miss a heart , and to a human face . 
it sees the market promotes entrepreneurship at the expense of human solidarity . 
john paul ii so passionate about not for modern western society , with its separation from the world of values , and he opposed to the moral sensitivities of companies just out of several decades of dictatorship . 
as alexander solzhenitsyn , the pope tends to believe that it is above all in the resistance to totalitarianism that man can become truly free and preserve the fundamental values of civilisation . 
i confess that i consider the legacy of communism with greater scepticism . 
the totalitarian pressure has indeed created exceptional men as john paul ii and alexander solzhenitsyn , people who consider that religious faith has bought the freedom from the lies and solitude . 
but it has also created men such as andrei sakharov and vaclav havel , who have defended their supreme values by referring to a secular humanism and speaking on its behalf . 
however , for most people , life under a totalitarian dictatorship was certainly nothing ennoblissant ; it was more of a daily immersion in the lies , the spiritual depravity and corruption material . 
that is why the post-communist societies do no nobility or disinterest which trancheraient deeply with the west . 
the defeat of communism has left a large black hole in the souls of the communities , a hole that is now given by ideas of nationalism , intolerance and western consumerism . 
but the intuition first of john paul ii is correct : the post-communist world ( from the east and west ) is a spiritual crisis and the pope wishes to undermine it in to be aware of the importance of values higher . 
indeed , by its words and by example that it shows , the pope disrupts the world : they want to live in the wealth and comfort , and the pope reminds us that we also have to live with dignity . 
no labels can only apply to john paul ii , who often represents a set of contrary : rejection of compromise / ecumenism , tenacity / enthusiasm , intellectual opening / insistence on theological orthodoxy . 
this is a conservative in love with freedom and a supporter of peace which condemns the injustice , but which reminds us that the clemency is more important than justice . 
it is in that it embodies the paradox that is christianity : the sacred principles and sustainable associated with understanding and tolerance . 
twenty-five years after the departure of john paul ii in rome , we poles him remain grateful for having helped us to regain our freedom . 
it is a good thing that john paul ii is among us . 
a world in which everything is changing needs a watchdog to monitor what does not change . 
the syndrome interventionist 
kosovo often plays the role of conflit-test for the concept of intervention " humanitarian . " 
but while iraq between in the spiral of chaos , diplomats and the leaders of all nationalities are wondering again if it is appropriate for alliances of nations or for the international community to intervene when a sovereign country seems unable or unwilling to defend its citizens against genocide or war crimes , ethnic cleansing . 
at the centre of this debate is the so-called doctrine of the " responsibility to protect " . 
as a mediator in kosovo appointed by the united nations for the past five years , i have had the unique opportunity to observe the effects of this doctrine , after nato intervention in the former yugoslavia in 1999 . 
kosovo has become an international experience of building society , conducted by the administrative mission caretaker of the un in kosovo ( unmik ) . 
experience is the right word here . 
indeed , kosovo was transformed into a test tube international intervention . 
i have lived and worked long enough in kosovo to see the result , and i claim that such experiments require more in-depth research . 
it is clear that the need for international intervention in the event of a crisis depends on each specific period , and a rapid response is often necessary . 
however , military factors , where such interventions are envisaged it is vitally important to concentrate the international policy discussions on the rapid deployment of civilian presence and security related to one another . 
it is even more true when the human suffering is caused by community conflicts , as was the case in kosovo . 
the immediate deployment of a civil presence and adequate safety directly after the end of the nato bombing of 1999 could provide appropriate mechanisms of protection against the backlash which has enabled the victims to become perpetrators . 
the peacekeeping forces of nato did not prevent the kidnappings , the disappearances , the murderous revenge and the massive destruction of property by ethnic albanian groups that resulted in a large ethnic cleansing reversed the population non-albanaise serbian ( mostly ) . 
a consequence of this neglect , a residue deleterious social and political behind the current kosovo . 
instead of calming the community conflicts , inter-ethnic hatred is more virulent than ever . 
in addition to the lack of security and civilian presence to reassure each community in general , the lack of legal mechanism to make justice quickly for the crimes committed during and after the intervention has created additional tension . 
this tension is so pervasive , in fact , that any prospect of start the if necessary reconciliation process must now be postponed to a distant future . 
similarly , kosovo , the international community has spent little time to help the veterans to consider their collective responsibility for the atrocities , that their personal involvement has been directly or indirectly . 
without such an effort , try to improve the situation is tantamount to build a house on a pile of sand . 
this lack of foresight and projects on the legacy of armed intervention is not only dangerous for the people officially " saved " , it is also counterproductive . 
when a humanitarian intervention is not structured to ensure a basic security , the underlying antagonism that inspired the speech at the base are that strengthened , not diminished . 
six years after the intervention of nato , kosovo seems further than ever of stability and social peace . 
despite the renewed insurance of the un authorities that kosovo is on the path to reconciliation and real autonomy , the representatives of nato indicate that there are plans to maintain a long-term military presence in the province in order to " ensure that the political process will be put in place with success . " 
this brings me to another key issue : an exit strategy as possible is as important to the success of any future humanitarian intervention that the strategy of entry . 
for international intervention has a real chance to succeed , it needs from the outset to define the criteria of " success " . 
only such clarity can properly put an end to the commitment of international players . 
in kosovo , such a clarity is and has been lacking ; as a result , nato and the un have no clear idea at the time or on the way in which they both need to withdraw . 
one day , someone has rightly said that it is easy to bomb , but much more difficult to rebuild ; it is relatively easy to undo a regime militarily , but it is much more difficult to build a robust civil society and sustainable in its place . 
the united nations general assembly should keep this idea in mind when it begins to codify the doctrine of the " responsibility to protect " . 
the divisions of the right wing in central europe 
eastern europe it will achieve a degree of political stability ? 
since 1989 , the results of the elections have continued to oscillate between the right and the left . 
vicktor orban , the young and shrewd hungarian prime minister it will put an end to this situation ? 
thanks to a brutal programme designed to absorb his political rivals on his right , fidesz ( hungarian civic party ) has managed to have almost as members that the socialist party on his left . 
it has also benefited from internal conflicts in the socialist party , that damaged one of its main assets policies : its strict discipline and professionalism , inherited from communism . 
the efforts made by vicktor orban to bring together under the banner of fidesz a divided right have been partially successful and are unique in eastern europe . 
since the collapse of communism in the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia , the parties of the right moderate are fragmented and lack of a genuine political perspective . 
although these countries has not yet fully addressed several tens of years of communist management , the divisions of the right have facilitated the election victory of the left , sometimes embodied by the former communists . 
the right-wing forces in central europe face problems similar to those encountered by right-wing parties elsewhere in europe , where you can see the social democrats reclaiming the liberal ideas , come to occupy them alone the centre of the political spectrum . 
in central europe , this phenomenon has been amplified by the fact that the parties in power , all political persuasions , have had to privatise the economy and introduce under pressure from the european union , reforms that in the west would have been performed by the right . 
in several countries of central europe , the left-wing parties have been better placed to carry out these reforms that the right , because , paradoxically , they have greater legitimacy for this . 
many people believe that the socialists are not may launch in privatisation or is not set to social protection if there had not absolute necessity . 
in central europe , the fundamental problem of the right is his lack of identity , clearly defined . 
although the politicians from the moderate right claim formally traditional ideologies , liberalism or conservatism for example , their electorate , little accustomed to western political concepts , do not always understand the meaning of those words . 
many opinion polls show that a significant part of the electorate of the different countries of central europe is itself on the right , but decades of communism to type paternalistic moved far to the left , the centre of gravity of the region . 
so a person can simultaneously declare themselves liberal and ask that the government continues to subsidize energy , education and housing . 
under the communist regimes , ideology was merely a tool at the service of power . 
as to this time , even today many people accept formally ideological labels , but does not want that to the extent that they can remove a tangible benefit in the short term . 
this cynicism toward the ideologies creates the brutal turnaround of the electorate . 
the problem of identity is exacerbated by the resurgence of nationalism . most of the countries of central europe in which the construction of the national identity has been delayed by communism succumb to nationalist sentiments that can be manipulated by the politicians . 
although some of them say they are right , the image of vladimir meciar , the former slovak prime minister , are in fact populists demagogues and authoritarian . 
the current situation of the right in the countries of central europe is also explained by their history and their tradition . 
the political developments in czechoslovakia during the past twenty years of communism has alienated the czech republic and slovakia , poland and hungary . 
while poland and hungary have suffered under communism a internal liberalisation that has allowed a part of the activity beyond semi-officiellement communist control , czechoslovakia has experienced a strict regime n√©o-staliniste after the soviet invasion of 1968 . 
in 1989 , when the communist regimes collapsed , the communist parties of poland and hungary have become left-wing parties , democratic and credible . they were able to oppose effectively to the parties of the right that is created . 
but in czechoslovakia , the rigid communist party has not been able to give birth to a democratic party strong , encr√© left . 
faced with this gap , the moderate right has had its hands free and was able to retain a certain unity until 1997 . 
but the absence of a strong opposition has led to the collapse of the right , which is divided and has lost a common language . 
in slovakia , a country in which the nationalist sentiments have played an important role after 1989 , the political forces do not come for the moment on a left-right axis . 
the main political battles between the nationalist and populist forces on the one hand , petrol undemocratic , and on the other hand the forces that are fighting for democracy . 
the threat of a return to power of meciar led all democrats , both right and left , to stand in the same camp . 
even in these circumstances , the right remains divided , allowing a possible return to power of meciar . 
in hungary , the right has been a victim of the opposition between conservatives and populist on one side , and the liberals belonging mostly to urban classes on the other . 
the right-wing parties have not yet agreed to whether they must align the ideologies of traditional western inspiration or on a form of nationalism conservative to the hungarian . 
although the current ruling coalition , made up of conservatives and populist , has achieved some success , the moment of truth of the right is not yet arrived . 
the polish right represents the most difficult . 
its problems date back to the days of communism , when the solidarity trade union has become the main opposition movement to the communists , while the unions are in general to the left . 
since the fall of communism , various groups close of solidarity have wanted to embody the right , trouble in the political discourse . 
christian democrat parties linked to the church and the liberal parties have been to a certain extent marginalised . 
the situation is even more complex than it must count with the populist and nationalist parties . they are relatively powerful , because they can rely on the peasantry which is an important electoral base in poland . 
as in other post-communist countries , it is mainly the democratic forces for the left , which have benefited from the divisions of the right . 
fed up with wal-mart ? 
do you want to know what vid√©o-clip will soon shaking policymakers around the world ? 
the economist thomas holmes , following a scenario looks a disturbing to the spread of a global epidemic , has prepared a simulation dynamic cartographic showing the expansion of wal-mart stores in the united states . 
starting with the epicentre to bentonville , in arkansas , where sam walton opened its first store in 1962 , the blinds big-box [ magasins-bo√Ætes ] giants wal-mart have now increased to the point that the average american now live in less than seven miles of one of these shops . 
it is interesting to note that the shops are moving in the way of the flakes of a flower which is getting and is spreading . 
rather than jump directly to the coasts , since 80 percent of americans live within a radius of 50 miles of the atlantic and the pacific , wal-mart has extended organically through a chain of suppliers in constant expansion . 
even if every new shop steals a part of the customer stores , wal-mart established in the surrounding area , the effectiveness of supply steadily improving helps to maintain the overall growth of the chain . 
we love it or hate , wal-mart is undeniably the perfect example of the costs and benefits of globalisation modern . 
consumers spend considerably less than in traditional stores . 
for example , the economists believe that the food at wal-mart is 25 % cheaper than in a chain of supermarkets . 
the difference in prices for many other consumer products is even higher . 
see the astonishing fact : with some other shops in the same style : target , best buy and home depot , wal-mart account for around 50 % of the increase in productivity america 's much-vaunted compared to europe over the last ten years . 
fifty percent ! 
and the same kind of advances among the chains of wholesalers account for 25 % more ! 
the idea that americans have become better at all during the other rich countries stalled is therefore very wrong . 
the miracle of american productivity and the emergence of the trade of style wal-mart are practically synonymous . 
i have nothing against these great hypermarkets . 
they are a boon to consumers at low income , and offset in part the tepid growth wages that many of them have suffered over the past two decades . 
and i do not agree with some of my friends who snub the shops wal-mart and claim to have never set foot . 
as a consumer , i love the big-box blinds . 
it is certainly the case trading partners in america ; wal-mart alone account for more than 10 % of all american imports from china . 
but i have reservations about the model wal-mart used as pattern director of global growth . 
first , there is the question of its effect on the workers to low wages and on retailers smaller . 
the investigations reveal that , while remaining within the legality , its social policies exploit loopholes in the regulation which , for example , allow it to escape the burden of healthcare costs for many employees ( wal-mart provides health coverage to less than half of its employees ) . 
and the arrival of these hypers in a community crushing retailers long-established , and often turn their personality dramatically . 
yes , up to a certain point , it is the price of progress . 
but the loss of aesthetics and of the community does not depend merely through statistics on income and the price . 
the big-box blinds are not really good-looking , where their name [ big boxes ] . 
if their explosive growth continues over the next 20 years , the americans consid√©reront-ils one day their proliferation as a dramatic illustration of the failure of the models of balanced growth at the regional level ? 
admittedly , many europeans , and others , would treat the simulation video of holmes replicating the development of wal-mart as a horror movie . 
the french may have invented the hypermarket , ancestor of the big box store , but they have never had the intention to let him develop without control . 
the big question for the europeans is whether they can find ways to harness some efficiency gains epitomized by the model wal-mart without be overtaken by him . 
for americans , there is also the question of what to do when the phenomenon of blinds equity-price big-box is . 
if a large part of the american productivity really is reduced to let wal-mart and its cousins supermarkets continue their expansion insane , what happens when this source of growth are exhausts ? 
the american economy has many other forces , including its financial system higher and its dominant position in goods of high technology , but the fact is that the advantage of the united states in this sector has not so far been so striking that the phenomenon wal-mart . 
it is curious to see how many people seem to think that the us will grow faster than europe and japan over the next ten years , simply because that is what happened during the last ten years . 
wal-mart and others are a central element in our modern era of globalization . 
they are not really the epidemic that their explosive pattern of development leaves appear , but their emergence is not completely benign . 
those who wish to emulate the american productivity trends must ask themselves today what they would think the appearance of shops in the form of boxes street politics during their campaign , taking the wages down and causing the death of small retailers . 
the americans , for them , must think about the place where is the right balance between aesthetic , community and small price . 
accept science 
economic progress in the long term is especially allowed by the invention and dissemination of improved technologies . 
the scientific revolution has been made possible by the printing press prints , the industrial revolution by steam and if india escapes the famine , it is thanks to the rise in yields , the so-called " green revolution " . 
the era of globalisation that we live in has emerged with the dissemination of computers and the internet . 
thus , when we are looking for solutions to some of the most difficult global problems , we can also find them , at least in part , in the new technologies that could resolve old seemingly intractable problems . 
take the example of poverty in africa . 
all the possible explanations have been advanced , and are usually the finger on what africans are wrong . 
but a visit to the african villages made it clear that the problem is more linked to the fight for survival in physical conditions difficult than to any other inherent problem with african societies . 
african farmers produce about a third ( or less ) of food less per hectare than other operators of the world , which has resulted in a large-scale famine , exacerbated by the heavy burden of the disease . 
malaria is a unique challenge of its kind , mainly due to the species of mosquitoes in africa , particularly able to transmit the disease . 
other tropical diseases are parasitic scourges equally vehicles on the continent . 
add the practical difficulty represented by the roads in a bad state and the scarcity of cars and trucks , and the economic isolation follows . 
the challenges of the survival are enormous . 
practical solutions are accessible , because of the simple and inexpensive technology can solve some specific problems . 
we can address the low yields thanks to improved seeds , especially suited to african conditions associated with technologies to enrich the soil and to manage water . 
malaria can control through new nets to the long life and a new generation of effective medicines . 
other tropical diseases can also be controlled , and technology practice to get drinking water substantially reducing diarrheal diseases . 
the phones , the internet and wireless local more roads could contribute greatly to break the economic isolation african villages . 
the donor countries are constantly asking for the africans to change their trade policies , their government institutions , their public administrations and more . 
some of these changes are important but rich countries sometimes go beyond their role by focusing on everything , except on how to finance and to introduce practical technologies to solve practical problems . 
the mistakes of rich countries would not to consequence if african countries had enough money to adopt the technologies needed all alone , but africa is so poor that it needs financial assistance to escape poverty . 
the challenges of development in africa are just one example of how difficult problems of companies can be resolved through the development and dissemination of technology improved . 
the same will be true of the best way to solve the problem of climate change caused by man -- another of these seemingly intractable global problems . 
for the moment , the rich countries to alter the global climate with millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide each year by the use of coal , oil and natural gas . 
in the coming years , china and india will also contribute greatly to the increase in the rate of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere . 
and yet no country , rich or poor , did very keen to reduce its energy consumption , worried that such a move could threaten its jobs , its income and its economic growth . 
new technology will make a very important part of the solution . 
already , the " hybrid " car , which combine petrol and battery , can almost double the fuel efficiency and divide by two carbon dioxide emissions . 
in addition , engineers have developed techniques to capture and underground storage and course of carbon dioxide from burning coal in the plants . 
this new technology can reduce 80 % of the emission of carbon dioxide in the production of electricity . 
the costs are relatively modest . 
consider also the depopulation of the oceans due to overfishing . 
the global demand for fish is increasing , as well as global capacity of fishing , the threat of extinction some species . 
a aquaculture improved , in which the fish are raised in tanks and nurseries , is still far from a perfect technology , particularly for environmental reasons , and yet it is very promising . 
during a recent visit to africa , a prominent agricultural stated that in the world , the scientist is more than ever around the farmer , but further than ever of the legislator . 
politicians do not understand the science , and rarely seek the advice of scientists and engineers when they want to solve major problems . 
everything is seen from the perspective of politics and elections , and nothing is regarded as a technical problem requiring a technological expertise , which is why the african poverty is so often attributed to corruption rather than ecological challenges . 
it is easy to dismiss the suggestion that the technology can be the solution . 
after all , technological advances are also asking for a good government , market forces , effective university and more . 
the policy is also a role to play . 
in any case , it is time to recognise that the governments are poorly equipped to understand the technological challenges sophisticated and the opportunities that the world could benefit from them , and that new methods are necessary to ensure that we give to science and technology the position needed to tackle a wide range of global problems , taking more and more urgent . 
now it is time that all the major international agencies and all governments take responsibility to use the scientific expertise and technology they will need in the 21st century . 
unblock the situation in latin america 
one of the biggest headache for the global economy is undoubtedly the poor performance of latin america . 
since the early 1980s , latin america has been blocked , with revenues increasing per capita income slowly ( if there was ) in the majority of the region and with a great crisis repetition . 
many policies were tempted , particularly the liberalization of trade , the privatisation of state-owned companies ineffective and the budgetary reforms . 
however , something prevents latin america forward . 
the lack of robust growth is even more disconcerting in the light of the many benefits and social achievements of latin america . 
the natural resources are plentiful and the fertile lands abound . 
the health conditions are relatively acceptable and all the countries of latin america have made progress against illiteracy , the majority getting at least 90 % of adult literacy . 
in addition , fertility rates have been falling sharply , to achieve a rate which the populations of many countries stabilises probably in the coming decades . 
the condition of women has improved and the girls have equal access to education , with enrollment rate higher than the boys in many countries . 
latin america is probably known for its culture " macho " , but the rate of women in the active population continues to grow and they are increasingly more political and social positions . 
latin america is very proud of other advantages over the long term . 
most of its citizens live on the coast and enjoy privileged access to international trade , and other live in cities , another advantage for growth . 
indeed , the region is not poor according to international standards , but rather stuck in the beach of income means , between the world 's poorest countries and the high income countries of north america , europe and asia . 
why , then , the surprising lack of real growth over the last 25 years ? 
i reject the responsibility on two unsolved problems , but soluble . 
the first is there for centuries : the social divisions whose origins date back to the european conquest of the native americans in the 16th century . 
even more than in other countries , latin america is born during a violent conquest . 
the europeans have permeated the indian population and have also brought back , especially in the caribbean basin and in brazil , massive cargo of african slaves . 
the companies have become racially and ethnically complex when the european populations , indian and african have practised of mixed marriages , but the trend over the long term the european dominance , enslavement indigenous and african-american , and poverty firmly grounded have deeply marked the companies in latin america . 
even today , the income inequality in latin america are among the highest in the world , reflecting the old models of ethnic and racial division . 
the income inequality leaves a large shadow . 
the rich are fighting for a long time against taxes needed to increase investment in the education sector and the health of the poor , perpetuating the profound social divisions and leaving many individuals without the health and skills required by global competitiveness . 
the situation is improving today in some countries , such as brazil , which bodes well for the future . 
in the other countries , such as guatemala and parts of the andean region , the social divisions remain marred by violence and mistrust . 
in addition to this problem , a fundamental failure of the economic strategy has been largely ignored , a failure which is reflected in the major difference between the discussions on public policy in latin america and asia . 
in asia , the public debate is about the technology : how asia it can catch up ? 
asian governments act with tenacity to increase the scientific and technological capabilities of their economies . 
in latin america , the world 's technological revolution is much less discussed and national policies designed to promote the science and technology is rarely climbing in the foreground . 
result , latin america has not been able to draw properly party of global technological revolutions . 
the developing asian countries now produce of computers , semiconductors , pharmaceutical products and software . 
by contrast , even the seller star of latin america , chile , remains largely an export economy based on resources , heavily focused on the export of copper and agricultural products . 
these sectors are technologically sophisticated , but form a narrow base for the development on the long term . 
the situation is far from being desperate . 
brazil has shown predispositions to be an export power technology . 
he has managed , obviously , to export aircraft and many consumer goods sustainable . 
mexico has also started to mobilise a huge technological know-how . 
argentina , chile and other countries could become of agricultural producers , in the vanguard of the agro-biotechnologie for example , if they gave the penalty . 
however , the countries of latin america have not yet tried to trigger a technological revolution , certainly not with the degree of importance , the competence , commitment and the financing of the asian countries . 
such a push could play a major role in the take-up of economic growth . 
such a policy would commit to significantly increase spending on research and development , as did the asian countries developing . 
the countries of latin america must increase spending to 2 % of gdp ( currently 0,5 % ) , in part through public support for laboratories and universities and in part by benefits for research and development of the private sector . they should roll out the red carpet to multinational companies , as asia has done . 
they also need to focus more on training in science and technology and encourage a greater proportion of students to receive a university education . 
according to the government school and for the new universities as well as for universities agrandies can play a big role , as investment in computers and information technology in schools and communities . 
the social programme and the technological programme depend on one another . 
both require companies to latin america to invest more in individuals who are affected by these programmes , so that the latin americans can put itself at the forefront of progress in productivity in the world . 
if these investments affect all the countries of latin america , both rich and poor , the prospects of the region is illumineront considerably . 
house prices : a house of cards ? 
the first major city to know a boom was london , around 1996 . 
this attitude spread to los angeles , new york and sydney to 1997 and paris in 1998 , to miami , moscow and shanghai in 2001 and vancouver in 2002 . 
these cities and others have seen house prices surge since that time . prices are upwards of at least 50 % in constant prices since 2000 . 
this was the source of important windfall profits for the owners but also a source of problem for any person preparing to acquire property . 
today , rising home prices falters in some of these big cities . 
the rate of growth in london and new york has slowed down dramatically over the past year , and is down to 1 % of a real increase in the second quarter of 2004 . 
has sydney , the prices of homes are actually fell during the second quarter . 
is this the end of the boom ? 
no city in benefit ? 
worse still , the mood of the real-estate markets could lead to a fall in prices ? 
no one had predicted this boom , then predict its end is risky . 
housing prices have shown a terrible bottom-up movement against the previous warnings of the end of the festival . 
any prediction about the end of the boom requires an understanding of the reasons for its development in so many different cities . 
curiously , there is no explanation generally accepted because the ultimate causes of the boom is mainly psychological . 
economists prefer to discuss interest rates or the unemployment statistics , factors concrete and likely to be known . 
of course , these indicators were a legitimate role to play in the explanation of the housing markets , but they are not enough simply not to explain the recent booms . 
three psychological causes from all of this : first of all , a change in the perception of the public about the sources of value in a changing global economy , and then growing confidence of the public in the cities " glamour " whose name is known worldwide and finally the simple exhilarating dynamic of bubbles . 
each factor deserves greater if you want to understand the current conditions of the market and discern future trends in prices . 
first of all , the world economy seems more chaotic than it was ten years ago . 
the fall in share prices since 2000 in most countries gives an air little reassuring to financial assets , stimulating the " refuge to the quality " , or in this case to the stone . 
in addition , terrorism is now seen as a problem for everyone , indonesia , spain and russia having suffered their own tragedies . 
we are reassured by investing in stone , and there is little reason to expect an imminent change . 
the fear and soaring house prices to encourage each other . 
then , the public 's trust in the international cities glamour increases thanks to the explosive growth of global communication via the internet and the mobile telephone . 
just as people increasingly admire international celebrities , there is the centres of business , technology and culture -et whose names are familiar to everybody , uniquely valuable . 
as for the fear of terrorism and the lack of confidence in the stock markets , the geographical celebrity seems elastic not to say autorenforc√©e : new york , paris and london are famous , the more they are glamorous . 
finally , the contagion behind any speculative bubble cannot be ignored . 
the current boom has seen the contagion spread inside the markets and through the markets , the rising price of fuel popular excitement -et and further price increases in the same city , and then in other cities , to the other side of the planet . 
the inhabitants of shanghai does not perhaps struggling housing prices in london , but the leaders of public opinion in shanghai know what is happening in london , and all boom is producing in this city makes the possibility of a boom in shanghai plausible . 
by opposition to the two other psychological reasons , the speculative contagion has a natural end . 
a speculative bubble , which is itself only on the reaction to rising prices , cannot continue indefinitely . 
so , where does this leave us ? 
two of the psychological causes suggest a continuous rise in house prices , while the third suggests the end of this movement upward one of these days , without specifying when . 
i bet that some of the cities so strongly glamorous will continue to assist the slowdown in the growth of home prices , and then possibly to their decline . 
historically , the price of real estate has always demonstrated strong movements , and prices in all of these cities is still rising at a rate important , even if it is generally somewhat slower than it was a year or two . 
if we extrapolate the growth trends , it seems reasonable to forecast that prices will continue to grow substantially in most of these cities for a year or two , even if the growth rate continues to decline . 
the psychological factors are more important for the long-term forecasts , beyond a year ago , when the upward movement no longer plays an important role . 
at this point , the prices will probably unstable downwards , because the enthusiasm for investment in stone collapses probably at the same time that the decline in price growth . 
prices in cities glamour will fall significantly to the next recession or when the economy will suffer are next big shock or even if interest rates rise too quickly . 
then the contagion inside and through the markets fall , with falling prices for years . 
water for all 
this month , once again , the water has taken centre stage in the fourth world water forum in mexico . 
this is an opportune time : while the attention of a large part of the world is focused on issues of energy supply and security , hundreds of millions of people in developing countries , still see the supply of fresh water as just as important , if not more . 
the investigations by the world bank in developing countries show that , when you ask the poor to appoint the three most important challenges they face , their " good health " is still part of this list . 
and the key factor that determines whether they will keep this good health remains access to clean water . 
today , in the world , more than a billion people do not have access to it . 
because of this , they are always more easily in the grip of a bad health . 
the world bank estimates that in 2035 , nearly three billion people , almost all in developing countries , could live in conditions of lack of water very serious , particularly if they live in africa , the middle east or south asia . 
this will cause the obvious difficulties , but it also hamper economic growth needed to these millions of people to escape poverty . 
in latin america , nearly 15 % of the population , or nearly 76 million people , has no access to safe drinking water , and 116 million people have access to any health service . 
the numbers are worse for africa and parts of asia . 
this is a situation that few people face in rich countries . 
usually , the citizens of those countries benefit from public services that meet all their needs in water , since the drink until irrigation and health needs . 
in addition , other issues related to water , such as the risks presented floods , have been reduced to manageable levels . 
the rich industrial countries have invested very early and massively in infrastructure , the institutions and water management . 
the results , beyond the health benefits that this provides to all , have provided evidence of a record economic growth : consider the hydroelectric investments to understand the positive impact of projects management of water in many countries . 
of course , rich countries have some advantages : they have generally moderate climates where the rains are regular , and usually pose little risk of drought or flood . 
even so , they are not immune from disasters related to water , as the destruction of new orleans by hurricane katrina we showed . 
but the impact of such events on poor countries is far more important . 
the extreme fluctuations of the rains , floods and droughts can have social and economic effects and result in loss of life on a large scale . 
the coast of the gulf of mexico and the countries of central america are constantly the experience of such tragedies , the deprived communities are the most vulnerable and least able to deal with these events . 
ethiopia and yemen are two examples equally remarkable one than the other . 
the development potential of ethiopia is so closely linked to the seasonal rains that sharp movements in the rain , and the lack of infrastructure , has undermined the growth and perpetuated poverty . 
a simple drought can reduce the growth potential of 10 % in the long term . 
yemen , about him , has no permanent surface water and its citizens depend entirely on rainfall , groundwater and floods . 
to move forward , developing countries need new infrastructure and better management of water . 
any approach must be designed in connection with the specific context of each country and the needs of their respective people , but there is no forced to basis linked to investments of exploitation of water which ensures that local communities and the environment can learn tangible benefits quickly . 
in some countries , the implementation of new infrastructure for the water usually mean the creation of channels , pumping stations and dams . 
other countries may need more profound reservoirs , sewage treatment plants more modern systems or of water transport improved . 
all of this can possibly be designed to improve and extend the reserves of water for energy generation , irrigation , and industrial use and private , while guaranteeing a certain security against droughts and some protection against flooding . 
the key to the success of any increase investment in infrastructure of water st. to increase proportionally investments in the institutions that administer water . 
if the infrastructure is badly managed , this will not help to improve the health of populations or support economic growth : the organisation of water and water management must function pair . 
the infrastructure can and must be developed in parallel with good institutions , well run , in respect of the environment and with a fair share of costs and benefits . 
a policy of investment in the water that reduced the vulnerability of the poor and provides access to the water for all requires a personalized management and a special partnership between the donor countries , the governments of developing countries , the private sector and the local communities . 
delegates from the world water forum will have multiple opportunities to forge and strengthen these partnerships . 
if they succeed , the benefits that will draw the poor people of the world will be immense . 
germany in a state of economic shock 
over the past ten years , germany has experienced economic growth the slowest of the european union , and europe the slower growth in the world . 
from 1995 to 2005 , german growth will not exceeded 14,6 % , while the average of the old eu was 24 % , that of the united states 39,9 % , and the world economy 45,6 % . 
what explains so bad results of germany ? 
according to franz m√ºntefering , leader of the social democrat party at the head of germany , it is simply because the country is already where other people want to go . 
the slow growth , german support , is a sign of natural convergence . 
this theory is far from convincing . 
germany has recently been doubled in terms of per capita income by many eu countries , including ireland , the united kingdom , the netherlands and france , and its growth is slower than their own . 
another theory , more plausible , is that over the past fifteen years several external challenges , or shocks , have simultaneously rocked the country . 
trapped by its rigidity , its social system extended and a labour market very regulated , germany has been unable to react to these shocks and began to meet problems . 
this theory is not without reminiscent of the british historian arnold toynbee that empires crumble because they are unable to respond to the external challenges . 
the first shock was the intensification of globalisation , which has caused the massive influx of competition on low wages . 
even if globalisation is a gradual process , she won in energy when china has decided to enter the game . 
china is ten times the size of japan , and japan had not been very easy to manage . 
the instruments of precision and optical equipment in germany , for example , have lost their competitiveness when japan entered into stage . 
the second shock has been that of european integration , especially enlargement in the north and south . 
the dismantling of the eu 's internal frontiers has expanded all of a sudden the size of national markets and caused the economies of scale envisaged . 
but this phenomenon has favoured the small european countries as the biggest , and has involved more competition for germany , the biggest economy in europe . 
take nokia , the maker of mobile phones . 
thanks to the economies of scale made possible by the common market , nokia has been able to fully exploit its inventions , while german siemens had recently decided to drop the mobile phone market . 
the third shock has been the euro . the european currency has caused rapid convergence of long-term interest rates , which in some countries have reached up to 5 to 7 percentage points more than in germany . 
freed from the exchange rate risks , international investors are asking for more risk premium in these countries and gladly accept their provide all of the funds on favorable terms , what was once the preserve of germany . 
europe is that profits , because the capital are now better distributed and growth driven by the movement of economies of germany to remote areas and formerly disadvantaged in the euro zone . 
however , the benefit is doubtful for german workers who also would have wanted to take advantage of this capital . 
the fourth shock has taken the form of the eastward enlargement of the eu , which has caused extraordinary opportunities for trade and investment , but also the flurry of labor at low prices . 
on average , the levels of wages in the 10 countries which joined the eu in 2004 represent only 14 % of those of west germany . 
low wage competition has led to substantial relocation and off-shore activities that have allowed the german companies to remain competitive in reducing their request of labor national . 
given that neither the trade unions , nor the german social system could not accept pay cuts , the result has been an increase in unemployment and the slowdown in growth . 
the fifth shock , it is the unification of germany , a failure in terms of economy . 
gdp per person of working age in east germany accounted for 61 % of the level of west germany in 1996 , but it is waning today to 59 % . 
the slow growth of the east of the country has lowered the average german , while the huge demand for public funds is widening public debt . 
the weakness of the fiscal position in turn has undermined investor confidence , with obvious impact on economic growth . 
these five shocks are historical developments beneficial for the whole world , but problematic for germany . 
if the country wants to face up to its challenges and continue to grow , it needs to relax its labour market . 
this is that if wages are adjust downwards to adapt to the new global environment that german workers redeviendront competitive , and that the country is again a low unemployment rate , exploiting its human capital until the constraint of capacity . 
the new government that voters will likely choose in september will be faced with the difficult task of putting the germans face reality and introduce the necessary reforms . 
it was only then we will know if germany is able to face the challenge of toynbee ahead . 
the lessons of the tsunami 
many lessons emerge from the tsunami , cause of both of devastation and loss of human life in asia . 
this is proof of globalisation , whereas television showed the vivid images of the destruction of homes in the world . 
indeed , it is in these moments that the world really looks like a global village . 
of course , it seems that the information on the scale of the disaster take longer to reach the president bush 's ranch in crawford , texas . 
but , ultimately , he decided to interrupt his holiday to offer aid that the amount has ceased to be revised upwards in international competition that promised to benefit those who wanted desperately to be helped . 
american aid still seems mean-spirited by comparison with the amounts offered by countries that do not have a fraction of american wealth . 
australia , which is sparsely populated , has offered more than double american aid , japan has promised 50 % more than america and europe has embarked on a sum five times higher . 
this has helped many observers point out that the richest country in the world was in fact the more wretched in terms of international aid , especially when it is compared to the sums involved in defence and the war . 
this disaster is international , so it is appropriate that the united nations to take the lead in coordinating the humanitarian effort . 
unfortunately , in an effort that was widely seen as a new attempt to undermine multilateralism , the us tried to take the head of a " central " of assistance programme , ignoring the relentless efforts within the region and under the auspices of the united nations . 
what that has been the pattern of america , she decided later join wisely the united nations in their efforts . 
the rhetoric used to save the face of the bush administration , claiming that it was set up a core group in the absence of any other effort has slowly been dropped . 
the response of some countries in the region was really impressive , showing the progress made in the establishment of governments efficient and effective . 
myriad details were examined : thailand sent ambassadors in the affected regions of the country to help meet the needs of citizens , " aida " those who have lost everything , passport and goods , to return home , soigna wounded , mit systems in place of identification of the body and traita the difficulties posed by the shortage of body bags and the absence of refrigerated places for the conservation of the body . 
countries like thailand have seen that they could cope with the financial consequences for themselves have asked that humanitarian aid is being sent to other countries . 
they have asked that one thing : the reduction of tariffs and better access to foreign markets . 
they were asking for charity , just a chance to win their own income . 
they have not received in response , at least when i write these lines , that a silence relentless . 
moreover , the g7 has chooses to contribute significantly by offering to alleviate the debt . 
this is particularly important in the case of indonesia , whose debt service amounts to 132 billion dollars , including 70 due to public creditors or guaranteed by the government administrations . 
even without the throes of the tsunami , the weight of this debt would have been a huge disability in the development of this country still recovering from the consequences of the financial crisis of 1997 . 
indeed , the indonesian debt relief is a convincing case to the extent that most of the debts were incurred on the occasion of loans granted to the corrupt government of suharto . 
the leaders knew , or should have known , that part of the total claimed was not going to be attributed to the development of indonesia . 
in addition , a part of the debt was incurred during the crisis of 1997-98 , aggravated and extended by the policies imposed by the imf . 
no one pretends that it is possible to alter or to prevent the forces of nature . 
rather , we must learn to manage them . 
this is now warning systems improved to prevent possible tsunamis . 
we already have , however , received a warning in the field of climate change . 
most countries recognise this and gathered in rio and kyoto to act together : even if it is insufficient , the kyoto protocol was designed as a first step in the right direction . 
unfortunately , the warming of the planet will destroy probably the same countries that those who come to be devastated by the tsunami . 
the islands of low altitude as the maldives will be submerged . 
we are not yet a global village . 
after contesting the scientific evidence highlighting the problems , the biggest polluter in the world , the us , has simply refused to act beyond the simple appeal to a certain voluntary restriction that we see little to work , in america , in any case . 
the international community must still consider the treatment to treat this absurd that refuses to take responsibility for global citizen . 
the optimists say that the technology will enable us to solve these problems . 
the realists will see that in the long race between technology and the environment , it seems that the technology is to this day the big loser . 
nature , as shown by the tsunami , has its own clock . 
until we have learned to respect it , we will miss all the train . 
the accuracy of the experts 
every day , the experts we are bombarded with their views on subjects as diverse as the iraqi insurgents , coca growers bolivians , european central bankers and the politburo of north korea . 
how are they credible , these experts ? 
an optimistic view is that as long as those who sell expertise are competing vigorously for the attention of sagaces buyers ( the media ) , market mechanisms will ensure quality control . 
the experts published in the opinion pages of newspapers , or that go on television and radio , must surely enjoy a good reputation because otherwise they would have been removed . 
skeptics warn , however , that the media we impose their choice of speakers and that they are less interested in the debates reasoned that by how to adapt to the popular prejudices . 
as a result , the celebrity may very well be linked negatively , and not in a positive way , accuracy in the long term . 
until recently , no one knew who was right because nobody preserved trace of the results of these experts . 
but a staggered over 20 years , research suggests today that sceptics are the closest to the truth . 
i describe this project in detail in my book " expert political judgment : how good is it ? how can we know ? 
[ the political judgment of the experts : what is it ? 
how do i know ? the original idea was to ask for thousands of predictions from hundreds of experts about the fates of dozens of countries , and noting those predictions according to their accuracy . 
we have discovered that not only the media are not eliminating bad ideas , but they often favour , especially when the truth is too complex to be presented sharply . 
the evidence fall into two categories . 
first , as have warned the sceptics , when hordes of experts are fighting for the limelight , many are tempted to claim that they know more than in reality . 
the experts providing for the worst and the best are those who have the more inclined to exaggerate . 
between 1985 and 2005 , the experts were the most optimistic forecasts over 10 years that exaggerated the chances of major positive changes both in the financial markets ( by ex a dow jones to 36 000 ) and in terms of global politics ( for example , the calm in the middle east and dynamic growth in sub-saharan africa ) . 
they have assigned the odds of 65 % to rosy scenarios that materialised in only 15 % of cases . 
during the same period , the most pessimistic experts were even more mistaken , exaggerating the risks of negative changes even where the experts were too optimistic in good news , and by adding many other ( i am still waiting for the imminent disintegration of canada , nigeria , india , indonesia , south africa , belgium and sudan ) . 
they have attributed the odds of 70 % to dire scenarios that have realised that in 12 % of cases . 
in addition , as had again predicted the sceptics , experts claiming to know more in reality rarely pay for their mistakes . 
indeed , the media of their pay much attention while neglecting their colleagues more modest . 
you can see this process particularly highlighted when , following the philosopher sir isaiah berlin , we cat√©gorisons experts in " h√©rissons " and " foxes " . 
hedgehogs are those who have big ideas and amourachent grand theories : libertarianism , marxism , environmentalism , etc . 
their self-confidence can be contagious . 
they know how to maintain the momentum of a discussion by multiplying the reasons showing that they are right and that the others are wrong . 
that is what their wins the approval of the media . 
but they do not know at what time based on their mental brake by making concessions to other points of view . 
they take their theories too seriously . 
the result : hedgehogs commit more mistakes , but they accumulate more success on google . 
the eclectic foxes arrive better to calm their ideological enthusiasm . 
they feel more comfortable in the face of prolonged uncertainty about who has reason even in bitter debates , admit their shortcomings and give legitimacy to opposing views . 
they punctuate their conversations of conjonctions which limit the scope of their arguments , " but " , " however , " " although . " 
as they avoid too simplify , the foxes commit fewer errors . 
the foxes are often agree with hedgehogs until a certain point , before complicate things : " yes , my colleague was right when he said that the saudi monarchy is vulnerable , but remember that the states are rare and that the government has many ways to crush the opposition . " 
imagine that your job in the media depend on your ability to broaden your audience . 
who would you choose : an expert who balance of arguments antagonistic and concludes that the most likely outcome is that nothing will change , or an expert who takes the audience on tenterhooks with stories of radical islamists who take control and cause a spike in oil prices ? 
in short , the qualities that make the foxes more inclined to the accuracy make them less popular . 
at this point , sceptics little charitable gloussent that we have the media that we deserve . 
but this is not right . 
no society has even created a reliable method for assessing the results of the experts . 
even the citizens who adopted the accuracy have little means to know that they sacrifice when they change of the chain to move from boring foxes to h√©rissons charismatic . 
it is here that between a modest proposal that applies to all democracies : the market of ideas works better if it is easier for people to see exchanges between accuracy and entertainment , or between the accuracy and loyalty to a party . 
do not liraient-ils more reports of experts who have had the most often right ? 
in this case , the experts could become more reliable showing more humility , and the political debate begin to be less strident . 
okay , it is not easy to create ways to assess who was right and who would cover the whole spectrum of opinions reasonable . 
but in a world where , as yeats , " the worst are full of passionate intensity and the best lack any conviction , " it is worth trying . 
what future for europe ? 
in many aspects , 2005 represents the annus horibilis of europe . 
it has started well , with the approval of the proposed constitutional treaty by the spanish voters , but it has turned sour when french and dutch voters rejected it shortly after . 
those votes reflected in part the discontent of voters towards the internal policies as well as their disappointment with the conduct of government of european affairs . 
governments are then sent to offer them always more of these cases unsatisfactory . 
in the days after those elections , they do not inveigled to agree on the european union budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 . 
the french and british leaders have engaged in a dispute that has wrecked the summit which followed , just before britain takes over the rotating presidency of the european union in july . 
generally , the countries concerned use the presidency of the european union to demonstrate their ability to solve the problems and to push the european union . 
but , since the beginning of december , britain sleeps . 
in addition to the funeral of the proposed constitutional treaty , it has largely abandoned the issue of the budget . 
there is very little chance that it reaches to adopt the budget this year , and , at least to quickly resolve the dispute , the european union will have no operating budget for 2007 . 
even if the budget will eventually be adopted , the austrian presidency , which opens on january 1 , will definitely not depressing affairs . 
the biggest problem is the inability to accelerate its growth and to offer jobs to its citizens . 
this is mainly due to the big three , france , germany and italy , which produce 70 % of european gdp . 
the collective response , adopted in 2000 , was the " lisbon strategy " , which aims to make the european union " the most dynamic economy and more competitive in the field of knowledge in the world " in 2010 . 
a more realistic , it is designed to offer governments the necessary encouragement for the care of reforms of everything that slows economic growth and productivity . 
this means the clash of a myriad of interest groups , since the industrial lobbies until the unions and the frozen bureaucrats , who have ( so far ) managed to protect their area . 
the strategy is based on the peer pressure and is to point the finger at the governments , which are not going to confuse them . 
in fact , however , the peer pressure turned into collusion of peers . 
when the leaders of the european union met last spring to take stock of their progress , they have admitted a pitiful that the objectives of the lisbon strategy had little chance to be achieved . 
they could , at best , now , stop pretending to be this strategy and continue their progress in other areas . 
unfortunately , jos√© manuel barroso , who presided over the summit in 2000 , when he was prime minister of portugal and president of the european commission , had put his presidency in stake in the case of the lisbon strategy . 
we must expect to see the defend so desperate . 
one of the few good ideas to the lisbon strategy was to remove the barriers for the exchange of services . 
the competition of services in europe is restricted by countless national regulations which , for example , determine strictly regulated professions , such as hairdressing or plumbing . 
one of the key features of recent decades is the significant increase in productivity in the field of services in the united states , but this is absolutely not happened in europe . 
guess why . 
because the services account for 70 % of european gdp and the potential impact of a competition improved is important . 
however , it is always difficult , politically , to remove the protections . 
the european commission has made a proposal in 2005 , at the same time that the constitution was put to the vote . 
it is hardly surprising that this proposal has quickly was abandoned . 
today , while a large number of groups of private interests are trying to dilute it up to strip it of all its meaning , this battle will certainly be included in the agenda of the european union for 2006 . 
europe also blocks progress of the doha round in international trade negotiations , the fact of the agricultural lobby who fight to preserve its subsidies . 
many governments fear their farmers at the point of having no choice other than to not give in , whatever the circumstances . 
europe has accepted the idea of a single trade policy . 
when the differences are as deep as they are in the case of agriculture , there is no latitude for successful negotiations . 
there is little reason to remain optimistic . 
and what will the future of the ecb , which has just adjust its interest rate from 0,25 % after 30 months of waiting . 
the experts may not agree on the relevance of this decision , but no one is in agreement with the many political leaders who say that this small increase will derail the small resumption of economic growth . 
the acidity of political attacks against the ecb could trigger dangerous debates on the restriction of its independence . 
even if it is out of the question that to happen , because it would require changing the european treaty , all the noise is not healthy . 
it deflects the ecb its objectives and has flesh out the idea that europe is a bad thing , and , above all , it will be used as a scapegoat by the governments failing to explain their failures . 
we can expect other reactions anti-bce . 
is europe in a rut ? 
the current team of leaders has greatly disappointed . 
yet we have a chance to see the light at the end of the tunnel with their gradual replacement . 
in germany , the chancellor , angela merkel , seems more positive on the issue of europe and more focused on the reforms that his predecessor , but it has the hands linked by the grand coalition that supports it . 
in france , president jacques chirac , image par excellence of the leader hostage to its pressure groups , unsteady , so powerless towards the end of his mandate scheduled for 2007 . 
the two leaders appointed to replace it , dominique de villepin and nicolas sarkozy , both in government , clashing on the bottom of the agendas of reform , but the previous years an election do not encourage radical changes . 
italy , for its part , will have to decide if it wants to replace the prime minister , silvio berlusconi , who shows no interest in the reforms and european affairs , by romano prodi , man prudent and former president of the european commission . 
tony blair , once an ardent defender of europe ( at least according to the demanding standards of great britain ) , may well have to cede finally power to gordon brown , who is well known for his lack of warmth towards european integration . 
fortunately , britain has always is an outsider . 
finally , whatever the light at the end of the tunnel , it shines perhaps not before 2007 , after the french elections . 
tame politicians on both sides of the atlantic 
despite the occasional ronchonnements politicians , nobody seriously doubt the independence of the european central bank nor the fact that the monetary policy in force in the euro zone is therefore well protected against political pressures . 
but the recent death of the stability and growth pact , killed by germany , his father , with a france playing the role of co-conspirateur and complicit complacent , reminds us of a key lesson : elected politicians are difficult , if not impossible , to abandon an immense power in the area of tax policy . 
this situation applies across the atlantic . 
the us federal reserve is , of course , extremely independent . 
but any attempt to limit the fiscal discretion of the us federal government in the way of the stability pact ( for example , the law gramm / rudman notorious of the clinton era ) collapses always at the end to the pressure of the president and congress . 
in the years of election , monetary policy can be used to stimulate , if not more , an economy , just as tax policy , and that is the objective of politicians . 
but the unconsidered use of one of these two mechanisms in order to achieve short-term goals could create long-term costs , justifying certain restrictions imposed on the latitude that have politicians to influence the macroeconomic policies . 
when politicians can control inflation in exercising a decisive influence on the central banks , they can use their power to devalue the burden of public debt , thus avoiding the need for an additional tax to repay this debt . 
this has been the great lesson of the 1970s and early 1980s , when a rampant inflation has forced politicians to renounce this power to the benefit of independent central banks which only could convince the markets that price stability would be restored . 
the monetary policy , however , is not a single method of drafting economic policies . 
the aspects of fiscal policy could also be delegated to independent bureaucrats in order to keep the politicians on the ranks . 
why not , for example , given to an independent bureaucracy a few goals of redistribution or control over the level of public investment or management of the deficits ? 
an independent tax authority could probably apply the long-term objectives of a society in these areas better than the politicians who have their eyes set on the next elections . 
indeed , in principle , it is impossible to understand why the monetary policy and fiscal policy must be considered so differently , one being fully delegated to an agency bureaucrat and the other being completely discretionary and left in the hands of politicians . 
so , why this vast difference it exists in reality , both in america and in europe ? 
because the fiscal policy is the major tool used by politicians to attract and retain the support of a winning coalition of voters , composed of pensioners , officials and owners of the middle classes , while imposing costs on the coalition loser . 
it is not necessary to keep 100 % of the voters , but just a sufficient number to victory . 
the fiscal card plays a critical role in the choice of groups of voters to buy . 
the independent tax authorities ( or tax rules such as the stability pact ) hinder this political use of fiscal policy , which is expensive . 
after all , if politicians cannot win elections by taking the money of a few voters ( including future generations , who will have to bear part of the bill ) to restore to others , they will have to work much harder to show some ability to produce public benefits for all . 
this is a task much more difficult ! 
of course , the policy also includes effects of redistribution . 
think of the various effects of interest rates on debtors by opposition to the creditors . 
monetary policy is , however , a rather more clumsy , indirect and imprecise to choose the winners and losers that fiscal policy . 
independent central banks can sometimes be an embarrassment for the politicians , but at least they can serve as scapegoats when it is needed , a role which the political benefits outweigh the costs of the loss of control on a useful tool . 
these considerations should guide the choice of the system to replace the stability pact in europe . 
it is now quite clear that national governments , especially those of the large countries , will never accept limits on their hefty fiscal discretion . 
they can have temporarily withdrawn their freedom of manoeuvre in fiscal policy long enough to allow the launch of the euro , but in normal conditions , the national governments will claim their tax territory . 
the european commission must therefore cease to deliver a rearguard action that only weaken its credibility , particularly in the eyes of small countries , which are the only ones on which it is possible to apply pressure to accept unwanted fiscal rules . 
realistically , the commission can only ask the european national governments to ensure that their tax accounts are transparent and clear . 
it is impossible to prevent the use of fiscal policy . 
but at least the fiscal measures of a country should not be hidden in the notes obscure footnote in its budgets . 
even this limited target can be hard to achieve . 
a strategic lack of transparency is in the interest of astute politicians who want to keep a pressure group , by concealing the costs of the largesse of the public to the majority of citizens . 
the rules governing the behaviour of politicians must not be written as if officials disinterested and well-intentioned would apply them . 
politicians are ready to give a lot of trouble to satisfy their supporters and win elections . 
we can best hope to ensure that the worst acts they commit to be made to face discovered . 
the european union it will keep its promises to turkey ? 
there are more than 40 years , turkey has asked to become an associate member of the european economic community . 
the association agreement in 1963 has created a special relationship , crowned by the customs union in 1996 . 
for all these years , european governments have continued to reaffirm that turkey could become a fully-fledged member state , provided to respect the membership criteria . 
formal recognition of his candidacy in 1999 has pushed turkey to take a set of reforms without precedent in the field of human rights and the rights of minorities , especially the abolition of the death penalty , the adoption of guarantees against torture , the promotion of religious freedoms and the equality between the sexes and restricting the role of the army in political life . 
if the european union considers the membership criteria were met , it must begin negotiations at the beginning of the year 2005 . 
otherwise the eu reneging on its political commitments and seriously undermine his credibility in the world . 
yet , a little everywhere in europe , this membership is viewed with skepticism , because of the size of turkey and its economic situation , for fear of mass immigration and especially of " cultural and social differences , " a euphemism refers to islam . 
we cannot deny that some of these factors are considerable challenges . 
but they are often exaggerated and certainly not insurmountable . 
negotiations with turkey would be long and membership might not happen before 2015 . 
this period would allow turkey as the union to prepare . 
with 80 million inhabitants , turkey would become one of the largest member states of the european union . 
but the role of the size of the country is limited in the eu decision-making process , where the political influence depends more on the economic power . 
in addition , turkey is for several decades a responsible member of many european institutions , and there is no reason to think that it behaving differently in the union . 
because of the weakness of its economy , turkey could claim to be substantial subsidies . 
but these transfers would depend on financial policy of the eu at the time of the membership , the result of negotiations and the evolution of the economic situation . 
in all cases , the " cap " the budget practised by the eu would an explosion of financial cost of turkey 's accession . 
immigration should not cause unnecessary concern . 
human mobility is limited , and the turkish workers would probably the right to move freely in the european union after a long period of transition , perhaps not until 2025 . 
given the strong growth expected of the turkish economy and declining birth rates , experts estimate that there would be about 2,7 million immigrants . 
meanwhile , the reduction and the ageing of the population in most of europe have made immigration indispensable . 
but among the countries of origin likely of migrants , turkey offers the best chance of successful adaptation . 
it is the muslim population of turkey , which is the most emotion . 
many have the feeling that turkey has no place in a european company founded on a culture and christian traditions . 
it also fears that the islamists do a day of turkey a fundamentalist state . 
as unlikely as secularism is strongly rooted in turkey , this risk cannot be completely ruled out . 
but there are in any democracy , where extremist groups could divert the democratic process to achieve their ends . 
the best way to prevent such a disaster is probably to strengthen the democratic system , and for this to anchor turkey firmly in a bloc of countries them as democratic . 
as for the european union , it must decide whether it wants to be a " christian club " closed , or the opposite an open society , strengthened and enriched by its cultural and religious diversity . 
turkey 's accession would provide a strong response , with particular resonance in the muslim world . 
the need to challenge the arguments against turkey 's membership of the fact that its benefits are rarely mentioned : a single geopolitical position at the crossroads of the balkans , the south caucasus , central asia and the middle east - regions of vital importance for the security of europe - ; a transit country for energy supply ; of military capabilities , at a time when the eu is in the process of putting its new european defence policy ; and a strong economic potential , with a workforce with the young and dynamic . 
at the same time , we must take into account the risks of rejection of turkey : the likelihood of failure of the reform process , which would encourage the extremist movements and would cause instability and political unrest at the gates of the eu . 
turkey 's entry into the european union opens up broad prospects and comes challenges to overcome . 
but the prospects are far superior . 
the game of democracy 
in calcutta , when a younger kid came along and insisted to take part in the game played my friends , we let it go , but only after having chuchot√© in the ear of the other words 
when we were children , it was important to control the cruel art of 
the technique of 
this applies to children and adults also applies to international institutions . 
indeed , the organisations are officially committed to involve all nations in their decisions are often controlled by small groups of powerful nations , while others are only make a mockery of participation . 
the world trade organisation ( wto ) , supposedly based on the principle of a country a vote , sees in reality its agenda programmed in the wings by a small group of nations . 
it is now common for the international organisations which publish a report all involve " stakeholders " and reflect their views . 
the report is then evolutionary generally presented on a web site and all without exception ( ngos , unions and other civil society organisations ) are invited to make suggestions . 
this promotes a sense of participation , but as a friend , paid in these matters , has taught me , the secret is to finally ignore all the comments received and in drafting the report as if there was no website and as if any participation had been recorded . 
increasingly , the free expression of opinion influence or control the behaviour of the government . 
take the united states . 
americans have voiced their opinion freely , in newspapers , on television , in the discussion forums on the internet , on the war planned to george bush in iraq . 
never before was there so much opposition to a war 
what happened , or rather what has not happened , is admirable : almost no effort has been undertaken to muzzle the criticism of the government , as is the case in china and in several countries dictatorial . 
but the largest democracies in the world , the united states , india , the uk , etc . , are more adept at banning the opinions freely expressed aimed to restrict the actions of the government . 
the war in iraq is perhaps the best evidence . 
leave aside the immorality of the war , and god knows how it is immoral ! i wish to draw attention to this growing ability and on the tendency of democracies to " deal " with ( therefore neutralise ) public opinion . 
they have adopted the strategy of the 
when the mature democracies , they become more than ever paid out in the management of opinion and , in most cases , in shaping opinion . 
every comment by hans blix on un inspections he led in iraq , members of the bush administration paraphrasaient what blix said . 
that paraphrase subtly alter of the comments of blix in order to support the arguments of america in favour of the war . 
by repeating the comments retouched , the bush administration hoped that public opinion would agree with the war . 
it can be difficult to reverse a regime totalitariste and to hold elections , but the toughest job is to transform the votes of the voters in a true democracy . 
for individuals used to living in a totalitarian state , this is not easy to learn the meaning of the term " participation . " 
hence the popular belief that democracies , as wine , improve over age . 
although this may be true , the maturity has its own disadvantage . 
while citizens of a democracy continually learn to participate , democratic governments continually learn to reach their goals despite the participation . 
there is no denying that the civic participation all too often serves only to legitimise pretence . 
we need to recognize and deal with this problem in order to prevent the established democracies of atrophy and in order to help the new democracies to become more efficient . 
because it is not only morally wrong to leave of nations and communities feel marginalised and without voice ; it is the best way to frustration , rage and terrorism . 
redistribution of governance in asia 
the governance ( the way decisions that affect the public interest are made ) has become a key factor for determining the pace of development of a country . a successful governance leads changes resolved . 
the failures are punished by the malaise , the discontent and stagnation . 
on 18 april will be held in bangkok a conference to discuss the prospects for improving governance in asia . 
asian policymakers today must face an environment far different from that of their predecessors fifty years earlier . 
the asian population has more than doubled since 1950 , mainly in the poorest countries . 
the political system in these countries was adapted for the populations of little importance , stable and rural . 
today , these companies must also manage urban centres extended that talent and multiple applications from the urban populations . 
the world economy has also changed radically . 
the increase in the flow of goods , capital and knowledge in the world means that the foreign organisations and individuals have a greater influence , further complicating the task of national governments concerned by the internal management of their own nations . 
thus , the international institutions such as the wto have changed frames of reference within which economic decisions are taken . 
the changes in the local economies are also radicals . 
in some parts of asia , the levels of life soared . 
foreign investment own external to the regions , or even have damaged the structure of the domestic economies . 
the old models of economic growth , however , such as the orientation of exports or the selective use of import restrictions that produced satisfactory results in east asia in the last century , are less well adapted to the new laws of international exchange . 
so we need to create new rules of the game . 
in most asian countries , the official rules must be simplified and applied more fairly . 
an approach " to return to sources " is essential in three related areas in which the national governments must take the direction : the reduction of corruption , the strengthening of property rights and the consistent application of legal principles . 
few countries can score points in these areas . 
the close links between the business world and governments have been accused of being responsible for the financial crises that have hit south-east asia in 1997 . 
in some parts of south asia , violent conflicts and the power of the interests in place have endangered the legal principles . 
the result of such failures is that the elites flourish while the mass suffers . 
a clear structure of formal rules remains the best antidote to these failures because they reinforce the informal habits for both companies . 
the cases will not lead to court but in the meetings where the confidence and reputation are key elements . 
as demonstrated by robert putnam , the social theorist , " social capital " ( the networks , the standards and social trust which facilitate cooperation and coordination to the benefit of all ) is as much a factor as a result of economic growth . 
given the power to all members of civil society as possible door to instill more surely specific goals in the efforts to move the nations . 
the government , the private sector and civil society all have a role to play in the strengthening of social capital . 
but successful interactions between these sectors simply cannot be sought , without any input and it is essential that the role of everyone must clearly defined . 
number of asian governments recognize the need to redefine their role more clearly . 
following the 1997 crisis , governments have taken out a little more of the markets , recognising the limits of their capacity to act and how it is important to let private entrepreneurship develop . 
however , governments have a role to play in the promotion of a favourable environment in which the markets can operate . 
the control regulations and enforcement are two important ways but different work ( say through mixed partnerships between the public and the private sector ) which are increasingly included in many asian economies innovative . 
the valuable role of civil society in the expression of community views that governments cannot achieve is also acknowledged , but his relationship to the government and the business world is characterised more often by the conflict that cooperation . 
the role of the private sector in the decision-making process , too , must often be clarified : where the companies are too influential , compared to governments , their needs to operate benefit can lead to policies promoting the elites rather than the masses . 
the metaphor of the game ( with its rules and its participants ) leads some to think in terms of international competition . 
it is not very good since our interdependent world is not a zero-sum game , where the gains of a nation represent the loss of another . 
in fact , the nations are not engaged in a competition the opponent each other as is the case for companies . 
the trade represents a positive sum game where all countries benefit from the exploitation of their areas of comparative advantage . 
good governance can improve this positive sum game and ensure that companies and individuals from these countries participate in profits . 
it is in some way of thinking to governments as well as to entities entering into competition ( providing a better service to their people that other governments ) . 
what makes an important role in international comparisons of systems . 
in this spirit , the conference of the unctad-undp this month ( " governance in asia : underpinning competitiveness in a global economy , " the governance in asia : consolidate competitiveness in the global economy ) , will bring together policymakers from across asia to discuss the challenges facing the governance must face in asia . 
the role of government ( the only player to have the legitimacy of a popular mandate ) is fundamentally important in the direction of a nation going forward . 
the private sector and civil society are , of course , increasingly important partners for governments . 
the functioning of relations between these participants deeply will influence the future of development in asia . 
the 18 brumaire of arnold schwarzenegger 
replace a governor that they had re-elected barely a year earlier by arnold schwarzenegger must have given to the californian voters an enormous pleasure , although tinged with guilt . 
some members of the opposition in germany would dearly love to do the same with chancellor gerhard schr√∂der , although they have not ( yet ! 
) found of film star to replace him . 
several other european governments also know a certain unpopularity shortly after their election . 
this situation is also true in non-eu countries , such as the recently acclaimed , brazilian president luis inacio " lula " da silva , not to mention the south korean president to roh moo-hyun , who has called for a referendum to stop the decline in his popularity . 
it would seem that these days , the effects of the electoral success quickly fade . 
each country must therefore adopt a call-back procedure to preserve the legitimacy of the governments ? 
absolutely not . 
democracy , to borrow the terms of the philosopher karl popper , is defined by the ability to remove those who are in power without violence ; it is now , according to this definition , a method by trial and error . 
but the leaders must be given the chance to govern . 
in fact , they have to have a chance of making mistakes , as long as their decisions do not affect the foundations of the democratic order itself . 
the method by trial and error involves the possibility of being wrong before try again . 
the first mistake of californian voters is " the attractiveness of the immediate future , " which is not surprising in a state where the immediate satisfaction is supposedly a fundamental value . 
but this appears to be damning sometimes in the post-modern democracies of all the countries of the world . 
indeed , democracy today has adopted a pop culture of fads which disappear as fast as they came ; the pop group the hysterical fans today will be forgotten tomorrow and there are plenty of others that are waiting in the wings . 
in politics , this situation can be dangerous because it encourages speedy decisions , whatever their importance , according to popular opinion that prevails temporarily . 
the call for an increased number of referendums reflects and fuels this trend . 
the referendums are , for the most part , the snapshots . 
switzerland , with its generally slower and its in-depth political debate before the elections , is probably the only exception to this rule . 
in general , the referendums use to measure the popularity of political leaders at a given time , whatever the problem at stake . 
if and when britain will decide on the adoption of the euro , it is more likely that the outcome of this vote we learn all sorts of things on tony blair and on the european union , but very little on the merits of the common currency . 
thus , the arguments in favour of representative government is not negligible . 
democracy is to govern organising debates , taking important decisions after in-depth deliberations which , at least in the big country , must be conducted in a parliament of elected representatives . 
the parliaments wish sometimes act quickly , and they may be forced to do so , but , in general , they take enough time to examine the issues in the detail . 
the parliaments speak before form conclusions , where their name . 
take the case of germany , a country in which some leaders of the group of christians opposition democrats burn of desire to reduce the government schr√∂der . 
obviously , the proposed reforms and already partly enacted by the government are unpopular and there is little doubt that a year after his re-election , the coalition of social democrats and the greens did very little chance to convince the polls . 
but who can know what the voters will think in three years ago , when the government 's mandate will end ? 
by the next election , voters , with hindsight , could realise that there was no real alternative to the policies of schr√∂der and it may even be expected that the beneficial effects of these painful reforms their become apparent . 
the leaders need time to take and apply both unpopular decisions that popular . 
they need courage to lead to parliamentary majorities precarious often on the road to popularity with ups and downs . 
that is why they are forced to take the measures the more painful during their first year in office , and then radoucir to the approach of the next election . 
the partnership precarious of prime minister tony blair and the finance minister gordon brown perfectly illustrates this kind of tactic . 
the leaders who will never their popularity are not worthy of their position . 
california has also demonstrated the bad example and californians will probably have to pay a high price for their mistake . 
it will , however , probably not as high as paid by france a century and a half ago , when louis napoleon , elected by universal suffrage , was transformed , through a referendum excessively popular , by napoleon iii , this vote is the last in france until the end of the second empire . 
californians , of course , will not be deprived of the right to vote , but their stubbornness may generate a form unpredictable and irresponsible of state policy . 
it is certain that democracy implies a limited duration in the time during which the powerful of this world must be able to exercise their power without dissent . 
a functioning democracy must give them enough time to win the accession of elected representatives to legislate and to apply their programme . 
these two imperatives are inherently contradictory , but a representative parliamentary democracy is still the best way to ensure the balance between the two . 
anything else would be as stable as the ten best pop songs this week . 
herbert hoover and the stability pact 
in mid-july , the good and great finance ministers of the member countries of the european monetary union ( emu ) met to discuss the economic situation of the euro zone . 
they ruminated over the most recent economic forecast , which projects annual gdp growth in the eurozone this year at a pathetically anemic 0,7 % . 
then , with the exception of one minister , they have all decided that their economy was to suffer a little of this obscenity or worse . 
they have reaffirmed their commitment to the stability and growth pact , which requires countries of the eurozone tax increases and cuts in public spending , increasing the pressure on their economy . 
this pact is already pushing germany to the recession , the italian government debate to revise its growth forecasts quickly enough not to be overtaken by an index of production failing . 
however , this does not seem enough to force the official to review their priorities . 
some european finance ministers still consider the stability pact as the " cornerstone " of emu . 
others talk of the importance of obey the " rules of the game . " 
still others argue that recovery must be done " in the spirit of the pact , " even if it remains essential to restore economic growth . 
view of the other side of the atlantic , all of these reasons seem extremely strange . 
the last time that the us government has tried to ensure a balanced budget despite the recession , it was 70 years , under herbert hoover 's presidency at the beginning of the great depression . 
since a broad consensus has established in the united states on the cycles of economic depression which require the use of fiscal deficits to relieve the suffering , stimulate demand general and rush the recovery . 
economists call these cycles of tax driven " automatic stabilisers . " 
when household incomes are falling , the same is true of the income of the public sector . 
tax cuts can increase the disposable income . 
but , mainly , when household incomes fall , the government 's social spending increase , triggering the recovery in demand , production , investment and employment . 
the lower taxes and increasing spending broaden the budget deficit but soundly and effective . 
the american side of the atlantic , the usefulness of these fiscal stabilisers is not in question . 
on the contrary , every threat of recession , the political debate revolves around their strengthening by pulses 
not more than it is a question of fiscal discipline . 
every time that proposals to amend the constitution to balance the budget have surfaced , the proposals have always offered exceptions not only in the event of war but also in the event of a recession . 
we know the origins of the stability and growth pact . 
the countries of northern europe , particularly germany and the netherlands , have always keen to maintain a report low between their debt and their gdp and interest rates relatively low . 
when these countries have found that the southern european countries , italy and greece especially , had usual a report high between their debt and their gdp and nominal interest rate quite high because of their tolerance visible against inflation . 
the countries of northern europe feared that the deficits of the south can create finally pressure on the partial monetarisation their debt through inflation of the euro , or more precisely , their leaders feared that investors scared for the same reasons demand higher interest rates . 
the stability and growth pact was intended to keep the debt of the countries of the southern europe to low levels , thus keeping interest rates low enough to reassure investors about the fact that the national debt would never be allowed to rise to the point of generating inflationary pressure serious . 
yet if you look at the economic problems of the euro zone today , the threat of the nominal interest rate high in the long term is certainly not part of the ten major concerns of investors . 
at worst , investors do not fear that a high debt governments to slow inflation in actionnant the printing press . 
the problems of the european union come from an index of production stagnated , high structural unemployment , weak growth in productivity , a common agricultural policy unnecessary and unfair and the forecast structural adjustments to the expansion of the european union itself . 
to a certain point of view , it is good that the euro zone finance ministers are ready to maintain their national debt to the lowest in the long term : this is a sign that the victories on inflation won in the 1970s will not be purely and simply ignored . 
but it is dangerous to fixated on the past . 
there is no safer road towards economic disaster than those of historical blinkers . 
as in show herbert hoover , when you consider that the economic problems of the previous generation , we may not see the dangers that are directly in front of our eyes . 
the ghosts of past our economy 
in the famous novel by charles dickens , " a christmas carol " ( " a christmas song " ) , ebeneezer scrooge , a businessman without a soul , is harassed by the spirit of christmas past . 
today , economists are similarly disturbed by ghosts undesirable , when they think about the resurgence of economic ills that were believed to be dead and buried a long time ago . 
whether stephen roach of morgan stanley or paul krugman of princeton , the governors of the american federal reserve or anyone else in japan , the economists in the world are concerned about deflation . 
their concerns date back the thread of economic thought of fifty years ago , a time when economists had discovered that the only thing to do against deflation was to avoid it like the plague ! 
in 1933 , irving fisher --le predecessor of milton friedman , the head of the school monetarist am√©ricaine-- announced that governments could prevent deep depressions in avoiding deflation . 
deflation --le steady decline and continuous prix-- of businesses and consumers to reduce their spending and hoard cash . 
this reduces the ability of shops and banks to repay their debts and can trigger a series of bankruptcies enormous destroying confidence in the financial system , which then feeds the fear and herding . 
such encouragement to accumulate rather than to spend maintain the request to the lowest , and always downwards while unemployment grows and grows over a period of time very long that even politicians and economists who defend hard the policies of laissez-faire cannot accept . 
so , is that the keynesian solution : using the monetary policies ( lower interest rates ) and fiscal ( inflation of public spending and tax reduction ) to keep the economy away from the abyss that makes deflation as possible . 
however , if this issue was settled over fifty years earlier , why tantamount to haunt us ? 
why it represents a threat that worried both japan today and is worrying the united states ? 
at the end of the 1940s , those who pr√©sid√®rent to the creation of an international economic order of post-war tried to create an international monetary system that ( a ) would stabilise sufficiently exchange rates for producers and consumers outside the dangers of excessive fluctuations and irrational of exchange rates , ( b ) would allow nations to develop their own macroeconomic policies and ( c ) will report the catastrophic panics which not only affect the banks and the individuals , but also the entire nations who produced the international financial crisis destructive of the great depression . 
this result in the creation of the bretton-wood system , where the exchange rates are fixed but adjusted , which became over the years the floating system of the 1980s . 
then came the 1990s . 
suddenly , the financial crises incredibly destructive r√©apparurent following the popular panic in mexico , thailand , korea , brazil , etc . , and looked like the american financial panic of 1873 or the crisis creditanstalt austrian in 1931 . 
argentina 's crisis at the end of 2001 looked extraordinary way to argentina 's baring brothers crisis of in 1890 -- if it is not that politicians and international bankers seemed to have a much better idea of what to do to minimize the damage that they do not seem to be today . 
so , if those who b√¢tirent the international monetary system of post-war worked to put in place safeguards to protect us of the dangers of the international financial crisis created by the popular panics , why this kind of crisis rena√Æt-il today ? 
the truth is that the economic policies familiar with a series of disasters possible , confuse anyone who seems most threatening for anyone who seems most away . 
in the united states , the bush administration remains skeptical of the stimulative power of monetary policy and wants big fiscal deficits to reduce unemployment , hoping that the future dangers posed by persistent deficits -- low investment , slow growth , loss of confidence , and uncontrollable inflation rate depreciation change-- can be finessed , or will not be visible until after the departure of the bush team of the presidency . 
in europe , the european central bank believes that the danger of a uncontrolled inflation following a loss of public confidence in its commitment to low inflation outweighs the cost of unemployment , which is still too high . 
in developing countries , the capital controls to prevent financial crises is seen as an obstacle to the attraction of the necessary capital to industrialisation and as a potential source of corruption since the financial flows spend in one way or another in the hands of the nephew by alliance the deputy minister of finance . 
flexible exchange rates designed to allow markets to indicate the loss of confidence in the currency also put exporters in a competitive situation difficult compared to producers of foreign countries whose prices have been battered by exchange rate little predictable . 
even the substitution of imports , today much criticised , were adopted in the origin by developing countries for good ( and bad ) reasons : the closure " protectionist markets of developed countries during the great depression would have disastrous consequences on the economies of developing countries . 
the ghosts of past our economy back because the lessons of this are still saturated . 
politicians and policymakers put forward their economic approach as " the one and only doctrine " . 
but what they do , in fact , is to manage the most important issues of the day at the expense of the disappearance of institutions and policies put in place by their predecessors to control of the problems they received as the more urgent . 
the visitors night ebeneezer scrooge were able to convince him that it was wrong and to open our eyes on his mistakes . 
hope that economists today will also the lesson of their ghosts undesirable .

overcoming the irish cocktail 
justification for humanitarian intervention 
i have visited the former soviet republics of central asia in 1998 to take part in talks on democratic development that has taken place ( or which was due to take place ) in these newly independent countries . 
my hosts were former communist leaders now that assumed the role of presidents elected more or less democratically . 
each of them spoke without constraints of institutions , democratic procedures and respect for the law . 
but human rights were a matter entirely . 
i have presented in each country , a list of political prisoners , asking what was their fate . 
in one country , the president has immediately decided to release a man accused of plotting a coup . 
but even this apparent success was morally ambiguous . 
the president had not taken a political decision : he had given a personal favour . 
i had received a gift , itself just another demonstration of the arbitrary exercise of power of the president , and not a sign of respect for the moral principles . 
in one country , i have discussed with a leader of the opposition islamic fundamentalist , which was launched in a long civil war against the government . 
this man fancied himself president of " committee of national reconciliation " . 
armed guards to the teeth , so that it strongly supported the notion of democratisation . 
indeed , he regarded this notion as the surest way to power because the vast majority of the population thought exactly like him . 
democracy , insinuait-il more worrying , would allow him to " eliminate " ( he did not elaborate on the exact meaning of this term ) the population opposed to his ideas . 
in democracies deprived of democrats , it is even more complicated to discuss " human rights " of procedural formalities because these rights are not considered " rights " in the legal sense , but simply as access of conscience or as gifts in exchange for another valuable asset . 
this distinction is particularly important because it draws attention to the limited effectiveness of official legal standards as a means of promoting human rights . 
this gap between human rights and the behaviour of leaders has led to the most important change ever occurred in the conduct of international affairs of our time : the advent of " humanitarian intervention " . 
this change is initially produced outside the established international institutions and the un system taking its origin of the french group doctors without borders who believed that human rights were a value more important than national sovereignty . 
doctors without borders has introduced the concept of the " law of intervention " in the humanitarian disasters bypassing the restrictions of international law classic . 
the international system has also quickly adopted ( and transformed ) this notion , and several humanitarian interventions 
the nato intervention in kosovo is a precedent which the secretary of state colin powell has used to justify the war with iraq . 
but convincing , if that is the cause of a military humanitarian intervention , such actions should be taken under the aegis of the un charter . 
after all , the promotion of human rights has been the guiding principle of the establishment of the un . 
its task in this area has been declared in the universal declaration of human rights in 1948 and in the helsinki accords of 1975 , which lent human rights legal supremacy on the sovereignty of individual states . 
however , there is a blatant contradiction between the universality and the supremacy of human rights and the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of member states , which are also part of the documents of the un . 
one way to overcome this contradiction is to introduce in the un charter a new chapter dedicated to human rights and to reformulate the chapter iv , which concerns the use of force in international relations . 
the principle of sovereignty must also be redefined itself . 
the world needs a system of legal systems ( bilateral and multilateral agreements , institutions of control and appropriate monitoring ) to regulate the use of force for humanitarian reasons . 
the legal restrictions on humanitarian intervention are necessary because the dictators use it too often to justify a criminal aggression . 
adolf hitler has drawn up its strategy when it has dismantled czechoslovakia , supposedly to defend the sudeten germans , and later when it invaded my homeland , poland . 
as has again demonstrated milosevic in the 1990s , when he was trying to defend the innocent serbs in croatia and bosnia , justify the military intervention solely on the basis of moral principles leaves too much free rein to distort these principles and abuse . 
that is why the debates on the reform of the security council should focus not on the modification of its composition , but on his mission . 
the council must be made explicit responsible for the " safety of man " and its protection , in addition to his current role of safeguarding of more traditional notions of international security . 
the principle of not intervening in the internal affairs of a state has never been absolute and globalisation presents this principle with a challenge radical . 
the term " international relations " assume an order westphalien commitments among of sovereign nations , which has replaced the medieval order of communities defined by the personal allegiance to a king . 
but the next westphalien today is in decline , and the significance of the state boundaries .
