Another crucial step for the Balkans
Since the world has been focused on Iraq, North Korea and a possible crisis with Iran over nuclear weapons, Kosovo has gone somewhat unnoticed.
The public will soon have the opportunity to turn its attention once again toward this province after the decision is made regarding its fate.
The United States and their European friends have repeatedly stated their intention to take before the end of the year the difficult decision to separate or not Kosovo from Serbia.
This decision, crucial to the future of an unstable region, will test Western resolve and unity.
The talks this year in Vienna, orchestrated by the United Nations, have shown that an agreement between Serbia and Kosovo on a "final status" will not happen.
Negotiations are continuing, but, as UN negotiator and former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari said very tactfully in the Security Council, they are in actual fact dead.
No Serbian leader will accept the independence of Kosovo because nationalism remains the dominant political force in the country.
Indeed, the Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, the apostle of Serbian nationalism, has made every effort to undermine the interim government of Kosovo.
He is eager to hold a national referendum this very month on a new constitution without serious parliamentary debate or the usual prior education of the public.
The main objective of this new constitution consists in the preamble, which maintains Kosovo in its status as an inalienable part of Serbia.
The Kosovo Albanians have said they will accept no link with Serbia, so tiny that it is.
Throughout the 1990s, they virtually left Serb-managed Kosovo by creating parallel institutions.
Their mass forced exodus in 1999 and the NATO intervention that followed, putting an end to the Serbian reign and establishing a quasi-state under the auspices of the UN, has made any solution other than that of independence intolerable.
A month or two from now, the Contact Group in the Balkans, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Russia, will consider the recommendations of Ahtisaari on the final status of Kosovo and will perhaps offer a solution to the Security Council, which must make the final decision.
In public, all members of the contact group attempted to leave the question of Kosovo's final status open, but in private the United States and some of its allies told the two parties they propose the independence this year.
Some members of the Security Council, notably Russia and China, take a dim view of or remain sceptical about an imposed solution, and few governments are in favor of dividing up the territory of another nation, however compelling the circumstances may be.
The choice by the Security Council to approve independence depends largely on the possibility of preventing a Russian veto, which will require considerable diplomatic efforts.
The nature of the independence granted also has its importance.
Independent Kosovo should be able to live in safety and its minorities should be protected.
The north of Kosovo, today in great part under the control of Belgrade, must not be partitioned off in fact while not being so in name.
In order to reduce the blow dealt to Serbia, the Security Council must avoid granting independence in such a convoluted manner that the new state cannot really function.
If the Security Council fails to make a decision as to a final status, it will create a critical situation: Kosovo will declare its independence unilaterally and all the nations will have to decide whether or not to recognize the new country.
If that happens, it is highly likely that the Serbs in northern Kosovo will declare their own independence.
At least, Serbia will greatly campaign against any recognition.
In fact, the government of Serbia is already trying to convince the West to defer the decision until mid 2007.
He claims that if Kosovo becomes independent, the ultra-nationalist Radical Party will rise to power in the coming elections, and he believes that holding elections this year will prompt the Contact Group to reject his proposal in the Security Council.
Moreover, the government has encouraged the leaders of the Republika Srpska from Bosnia to threaten to hold their own referendum on the separation from a still fragile Bosnia.
And they keep pressing in vain for the removal of Ahtisaari in order to extend the Vienna talks.
The timing for the organisation of the constitutional referendum appears to be part of this dilatory strategy.
Some hope that postponement will stimulate violence in Kosovo and will push the West to reconsider the independence of Kosovo.
This tactic may be working.
Many EU countries are worried about the implications of the withdrawal of territory from of a country, as well as the impact of the independence of Kosovo on Serbian Democracy.
Being given the political instability of Serbia, they put in doubt the damage that would cause a delay in the short term, which would be mainly self-inflicted.
But delaying the decision would only allow Kostunica to find new ways to make even more difficult a decision by the Security Council.
The West should ignore the siren song of Belgrade.
Serbian politics will be chaotic and unstable in the near future, and the Serbian politicians will try to use this as an excuse to avoid facing the loss of Kosovo.
Similarly, establishing ties between Serbia and Kosovo, whatever the circumstances, will be problematic.
But a failure to make a definitive decision today on the final status of Kosovo will produce a situation that is worse than in the Balkans, will hold up Serbia's movement toward the West and its future accession to the EU, will condemn Kosovo's ethnic minorities to a dangerous ambiguity and will endanger fragile nations such as Bosnia and Macedonia.
The only realistic option for Kosovo is independence.
If Serbia wants to rejoin the West, it must not relinquish this opportunity by letting itself get trapped by its nationalist past.
A new and dangerous beginning for South Korea.
North Korea's decision to expel the UN atomic energy inspectors is one more reason to consider the election of Roh Moo Hyun to the presidency of South Korea two weeks earlier as a historic landslide.
The beginning of his mandate does not only coincide with one of the most dangerous events of Korea for decades, but his presidency will also hold spectator to a testing relationship between the U.S. and South Korea to a degree never achieved before.
The victory of Roh on Lee Hoi Chang shows a generational change in the Korean policy, with a young people determined to win a freedom of movement in its relations with the United States.
In fact, generation differences were the decisive factor in the presidential election race, replacing the regional feelings that dominated every presidential race before it.
According to a report, more than 60% of the 20- to 30-year-old population voted for Roh, creating a gap of 2.3% in this presidential race which, for the first time in 31 years, found two men face to face, fighting one on one.
The populist and nationalist position of Roh will be quickly and severely tested by the reality when he takes his post in February.
But if one associates the generational change that brought him to power with a strong popular will to continue with the commitments as regards North Korea, beyond the fact that North Korea continues to strengthen its nuclear power, and the recipe is complete for a disagreement with the United States.
Roh, a student who passed the bar examination without ever going to a university nor doing his duty, has managed to convince voters that he would open a new era in politics, reflecting a better South Korea enriched and with a strengthened middle class, sweeping away the political games that are dominated by insiders, regional disputes and the struggles of factions.
His style and rhetoric put forth a new image (for Korea!) of a man of the people engaged in eliminating the sclerotic networks of favoritism and corruption.
For the first time in the modern history of Korea, the presidential campaign has truly been the site of debates on the central issues which the country must face, rather than focusing on the parties and personalities.
The candidate Roh has called for new relations between South Korea and America, based on the principle of independence and equality.
Thus, he announced no longer wanting to be an extension of the US nor to go to Washington to take the traditional photo. He also promised to continue the policy of President Kim Dae Jung, called "the politics of the sun ray" in its involvement with the North.
It is remarkable that Roh won the election despite the decision of North Korea to reactivate its nuclear reactors arrested since 1994.
A few years earlier, that simple gesture would have condemned the candidacy of Roh.
That he has overcome this obstacle without changing his position on engagement with North Korea shows that times have changed quite radically.
The People's urgent desire for change rather than a comfortable situation has now become the main concern of North Korea.
The Roh election campaign also benefited from a growing trend of anti-Americanism.
The acquittal by an American military tribunal of two American soldiers who accidentally killed two Korean schoolchildren on board their armored vehicle in June last year set off demonstrations in streets all across the country.
Although President George W. Bush apologized twice for the deaths of two girls, demand continued to grow for modification of the agreement on the status of the armed forces (Status of Force Agreement, SOFA) which governs the legal treatment reserved for American troops stationed in South Korea.
The Koreans insist that the American soldiers who commit crimes should be judged by the Korean courts .
This expression of wounded national pride was possible after the extraordinary performance of the South Korean team at soccer's World Cup last summer, which helped convince the Koreans of the full maturity of their country, and who thus can now defend themselves without the presence of 37,000 American soldiers.
In fact many Koreans now see the American presence, and not the communist regime of North Korea, as the biggest obstacle to unification.
According to a recent poll, only 54.8% of Koreans still favour the maintenance of American troops in their country, while 31.7% oppose it.
These feelings will form part of the test of diplomacy, which will give shape to the presidency of Roh since its inception, because it needs to rethink the relationship between Korea and the United States even as the Bush administration is concerned about North Korea's nuclear ambitions and its role in the spread of weapons of mass destruction in rogue states.
For now, Korean voters, apparently insensitive to threats posed by the nuclear weapons of North Korea, support Roh's policy of maintaining dialogue and economic exchanges with the North.
Under the presidency of Roh, the domestic policy of South Korea and its relations with the United States and North Korea will necessitate an almost total revamping.
Will he be able to walk the tightrope of maintaining security in the peninsula while remaining committed to America and keeping the support of his electorate?
Knowing these targets would be a difficult test even for the most experienced and the most cynical politician, then knowing if President Roh can succeed would be a good omen.
Any failure, however, connotes so horrific outlook  that nobody can really wish him that.
To each his path towards peace
Over the next three weeks, the Israeli army will engage in an exercise without precedent: Instead of defending the country against external enemies or terrorists, it is going to evacuate, by force if necessary, 9,000 Israelis in their homes.
The unilateral withdrawal of Israel is the culmination of a deep political change caused by two convictions that are somewhat contradictory and which characterised the policies of the Prime Minister Ariel Sharon since 2003: first, that the "road map" initially launched by the United States is going nowhere, and then that the status quo is untenable.
For Sharon, there is no doubt that the 9,000 Jewish settlers who live among the 1.2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have no future.
Therefore, without negotiations, a unilateral withdrawal is the only sensible approach to reducing violence and stabilisation.
This policy has deeply disturbed Israel. The settlers, for most religious, but not all, have felt betrayed by Sharon, "the father of settlements."
It is today the Israeli left, although reluctantly, that realises the new pragmatism preached by Sharon is perhaps the first step in the right direction.
Just as de Gaulle in Algeria, Sharon has redesigned the maps of the Israeli policy.
The last few weeks have been the setting for massive demonstrations, some of them nearly violent. A number of settlers have declared that they would not obey the evacuation orders.
The army and the police have mobilized nearly 50,000 soldiers to carry out the evictions successfully.
This approach by force is traumatic not only for the settlers, but also for many other Israelis.
Only the next few days and weeks can tell us if the evacuation is going on peacefully or not.
Meanwhile, Sharon has paid dearly for his policy.
Right-wing parties have left the ruling coalition, it has lost its majority in his own Likud party, and its finance minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has left its government.
It is only by inviting Shimon Peres's Labour party into his Cabinet that Sharon managed to retain his parliamentary majority.
The question evidently arises on the situation after the withdrawal from Gaza.
Initially, this retreat leaves many governments sceptical, but they have come to realize, as they say in Washington, that this was the only thing to do.
Among them, as among the Palestinians, some hope that after the withdrawal from Gaza, it will be possible to return to the road map and resume negotiations that will lead to a final agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
It is a huge mistake.
Even if he is motivated by the best intentions, hopes to resurrect the road map is not realistic.
Future negotiations will have to address the issue of final borders between Israel and Palestine, the fate of the 200,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, the status of Jerusalem and the problem of the Palestinian refugees of 1947-48.
The chasm between the Israeli and Palestinian positions on these issues has not diminished since the unsuccessful negotiations at Camp David in 2000, while fear and lack of confidence have only grown.
To try to enter into negotiations under such circumstances would not only be a futile exercise, but could serve to further increase the alienation and suspicion on both sides.
The failure of the Annan Plan for Cyprus suggests that good intentions are not enough - and disagreements in Cyprus were miniscule compared to what divides Israelis and Palestinians.
What is therefore possible?
The only rational way to proceed is probably to recognize that the unilateral steps of each side can further promote the cause of reduced violence and final reconciliation.
On the Israeli side, other withdrawals of dozens of small isolated settlements from the West Bank, causing the evacuation of 20,000 to 30,000 settlers, could prove politically feasible and would provide the Palestinians with a contiguous territory in the West Bank.
For the Palestinians, consolidating control of a dozen security services and militias under the Palestinian Authority would be an significant step forward.
The Palestinian leader, Abu Mazen, acknowledges it, but the question is whether he is capable of it.
The Palestinian Authority could also take the difficult path of telling the refugees that, contrary to 50 years of Palestinian propaganda, they will not return to Israel, but will have to settle in the West Bank and Gaza, areas that will become part of the ultimate Palestinian State.
In an ideal world conflicts are resolved through agreements and treaties.
But in real life, as the examples of Cyprus, Bosnia and Kosovo illustrate, stabilization and the slow decline in violence can sometimes lead to the same goal, even without formal agreement.
Plausible fault of alternative, one can only hope that it will be also the case for the Israelis and the Palestinians.
A new world?
BERLIN: Like old horses becoming frisky again at the sound of the bugle, the strategists of the Cold War feel their adrenalin rate increasing when missile defense is once again in the headlines.
To be sure, the anti-missile defense proposed by Bill Clinton (reluctantly) and George W. Bush (enthusiastically) -- and solidly backed by the American Congress -- does not resemble the Star Wars dream of Ronald Reagan 20 years ago: the NMD (nuclear missile defense), an American anti-missile defense system, is only supposed to catch a modest number of warheads and thus does not furnish complete protection against enemy missiles.
But the question revives the old debates about deterrence, of mutual assured destruction and control of nuclear weapons, and reanimates the rivalry between the nuclear powers at a time when nuclear weapons have lost much of their raison-d'etre.
Strangely, even while he is not certain that the missile defence programme concluded, the debate rages on.
Even if the system works, it will take between 10 and 15 years, perhaps more, before it is operational.
Things are also heating up about something which, if it exists one day, may only have little impact.
Ordinarily cautious governments are now lining up as if the future awaited them in the wings.
How can this strange behaviour be explained ?
Certainly not by a blind faith in technology.
After all, the history of missile defense is full of examples of technological disappointments for its supporters, whether or not they are part of the government.
No sane person can assume that what has never succeeded before, that is destroying a small number of warheads in flight, is going to happen overnight.
Out of the three tests that were carried out so far, one failed in part, the other two completely, it is the reason why President Clinton has preferred to pass the problem on to his successor.
If President Bush is now, as he mentioned, working toward a new formula, it will take even more time to develop the structure and design a testing program.
And we cannot be sure that will work.
Governments are worried at the present time, not because of what will be possible or not, but about the intentions, real or supposed of America.
Although the Americans say loud and clear that the missile defence programme is not aimed against anyone in particular, that the only goal of the US is to protect their citizens from countries like Iraq or North Korea, almost everyone is convinced of the opposite: the Russians fear that Americans want to cement their military superiority (and the inferiority of Russia) permanently; the Chinese fear that the missile defence programme is a sign of America's determination that Taiwan remain independent; Europeans fear that America's plans will create tensions with Russia and between the United States of Europe.
Because what is of primary importance is political intentions and not technical capabilities, now that the missile defense program is creating problems: it is pushing Russia to confrontation, making China nervous and strengthening a European sense of a lack of unity with the United States.
The damage begins at the starting line while the path remains uncertain.
The political consequences are further reinforced by the fact that, thirty years ago, the United States and the Soviet Union gave up on establishing an effective defense against strategic nuclear missiles.
Normally, an American defense project still in an embryonic state, should not cause as much excitement as the NMD.
But the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty banning, for an undetermined amount of time, systems designed to protect both of these two countries against such nuclear attacks.
Given the way the United States proceeds with the nuclear missile defense program, it will either have to violate the treaty or give six months' advance notice to condemn it, which the two signatories are entitled to do if they feel it is vital to their security.
In the eyes of many, it would mean that America chooses to abandon the structure of the control of nuclear weapons built during the last part of the Cold War.
The Bush administration claims that, because the Cold War is over, the formal disappearance of the ABM Treaty would not endanger nuclear stability.
But the stability is as well as a problem of perception policy than of technical calculations.
By limiting the antimissile strategy, the old treaty offers some insurance of desuasion for the governments that have nuclear weapons.
Its demise would affect all other agreements on weapons controls.
Russia threatens of tearing them all up if the US leave the ABM treaty.
Even if this threat lacks credibility (it would first be harmful to Russian interests), it rests on a certain logic.
The main question posed by the NMD is not how to prepare for a world missile defense but how to alleviate the concerns regarding current policies.
A few attempts are made quietly in the background.
Legal experts in Washington suggest that a moderate amount of  preparation for missile construction and radar sites does not violate the ABM Treaty and therefore does not force the United States to denounce it.
For now, the Bush administration will wait for the test results before making a decision.
Moscow and Washington both suggested that a deep cut to their offensive nuclear arsenal is possible.
The assurance that the United States will include them in the deliberations makes the sceptical European allies more indulgent.
The most important of the measures meant to gain trust, a modification of the ABM Treaty in order to allow a limited antimissile defense, is being studied.
The previous "nyet" from Russia might not turn out to be final.
Thus the political turmoil which Russia and Europe are involved in will perhaps calm down.
But China?
It is not part of an alliance (like Europe) or a network of arms control treaties with which political solutions can be found (such as Russia), and it is a contributing factor to the instability in Asia and the nervousness in China.
There, the trust can only be built on a rapprochement between China and the United States.
Unfortunately, there is nothing to indicate that Washington was aware of the gravity of the problem.
The old cold war planners are very disappointed by it all.
As they revise the vocabulary and abbreviations of the royal era of deterrence, they discover that it is a lost world.
The missile defence does not threat strategic stability between the US and Russia but if it is poorly presented, it endangers the long term political vision.
In announcing its determination to carry out a future missile defense program, the United States has created a policy storm that it must deal with now if it wants to avoid the worst of the damage.
To avoid a lost generation
A little bit everywhere, unemployed young people adrift are a cause for worry.
They are a problem in developing countries which have an increasingly strong population explosion, the equivalent of "baby boom" in the West at the end of the second world war.
But the period that followed the war in most developed countries has been an era of unprecedented prosperity for the baby boom that now approaches retirement.
Will the future also be promising for the 1 billion and a some-odd young people aged 12 to 24 years in developing countries?
These countries should, with all possible urgency, combine the investments and the political measures necessary to encourage young people to get training, find work, remain in good health, start a family and exercise their citizenship.
The benefit is considerable if they succeed: accelerated development thanks to the contribution of a young population and a decrease in the dependency rate.
In East Asia, this "demographic dividend" is said to be the cause of more than a quarter of the economic growth in the region.
Developing countries have already invested a lot as far as younger people are concerned.
They are now better educated and healthier than previous generations.
More than 80% of children go to primary school, compared to 50% in 1970, and infant mortality has fallen from more than 10% to 6.5% during the same period.
But governments should not be satisfied with investing on behalf of children, they must also begin to deal with the new generation of young people.
However, in countries where the vast majority of children complete primary education, few of them have access to secondary school.
The young represent half of new cases of HIV infection.
In the Middle East and North Africa, a quarter of young people are without work.
All this raises difficult questions: what is it that hinders access to secondary education?
Is it illiteracy that sometimes remains high, even at the end of primary school, or the lack of resources?
Why are there not more young people who know how to protect themselves against AIDS?
Why do companies in these countries often complain of a shortage of skilled labour when so many students find themselves unemployed upon leaving university?
An effective policy directed toward the young is based on three different types of action: more opportunities for success offered to young people, more skills and the offer of a second chance.
Governments must offer more possibility for success to young people by improving the access to and quality of care and education.
It's only in secondary school that students benifit of there primary school teachings.
However, many young people are still unprepared for the secondary and positions are rare.
Today, employers want highly skilled workers.
In countries as diverse as Algeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Estonia and Zambia, qualifications and inadequate training are difficult obstacles to overcome.
If you want to prevent young people getting caught up in jobs without any hope of promotion or simply having no employment, they must be able to enjoy a better education and training that meets the needs of companies.
Many countries are now trying to facilitate access to secondary ("high school") education, particularly through "conditional aid programs" that allow for the distribution of funds to poor families whose children attend school regularly.
These programs have helped increase the number of pupils in secondary school in Mexico, Ecuador, Bangladesh and Cambodia.
But for these programmes to have a purpose, the pupils must have the skills necessary to enter secondary school.
In Morocco, for example, more than 80% of children accomplish a first round of education, but less than 20% reach the required level.
The measures are also needed to help young people make good decisions.
Although a government cannot replace the parents or the community, it can incite young people and their families to take care of themselves.
With the necessary information and adequate encouragement, the young will be better equipped to make decisions as to their health and their future.
In Cameroon, Horizon Jeunes, a program on sexual hygiene intended for the young people in the cities, helped to increase their knowledge in this area and change their behavior. Thus, the rate of young women insisting on the use of condoms rose from 58% to 76% in the group that took part in the program.
Another example: in the Dominican Republic, the rate of enrollment in high schools increased when students were informed of the amount of money earned by those who finished their secondary education, an amount that they had greatly underestimated.
In Bangladesh, the assistance project for the female secondary school has financially helped girls aged 11 to 14 to continue their studies and delay their marriage.
Governments should also offer a "second chance" to young people who have failed because of circumstances or bad choices.
The corresponding programmes must be well designed, well targeted and coordinated in a way that provides adequate support to their beneficiaries.
And so, in sub-Saharan Africa, thousands of young fighters -- 100,000 in Sudan alone -- hope to rebuild their lives for peacetime, but they are obviously in need of training and employment, medical care and psychological support.
With political will, measures based on the efforts of the young people themselves to increase their chances of success and their skills, and the offer of a second chance to those who need it, these countries could maximize their demographic advantage.
They can either seize this opportunity for growth to improve their development prospects or take the risk of a lost generation embittered at the lack of a future.
End with European paternalism
The Italian President of the European Union bears a huge responsibility, that of reinvigorating the expansion as an essential aspect of the new EU.
The best place to start would be to encourage a better attitude towards adopting the Euro by the countries entering the Union.
In fact, the paternalistic attitude of EU institutions to the country homebuyers threatens to create a two-tier Europe which will complicate the process of integration.
The conceding countries have held their market share by achieving trade integration with EU countries that are more advanced than other countries.
Three of them --Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania-- have a currency board system or a fixed exchange rate with the euro, like Bulgaria, which must join the EU in 2007.
The others have shown their interest for several years in adopting the euro from the beginning, unilaterally in some cases, even before they enter the EU -- a position openly advocated by the National Bank of Poland, and to a lesser degree by the National Bank of Hungary and the National Bank of the Czech Republic.
However, despite their progress in getting their rates of inflation and interest closer to European levels, a good many candidate countries fear that, with the total openness required for accession to the EU, they will be exposing themselves to the risk of sudden stoppages of capital flow and to currency crises.
They have learned the lessons of Latin America and Asia in the 1990s.
The euro adoption, would very easily permit them to escape such risks and to focus their efforts on the creation of a real growth for their economies.
However, the response of the European institutions and especially the European Central Bank and the European Commission was negative: the candidates were made to understand that they must first pass two years in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM II), where candidates for the Euro would have to show what their policies were able to accomplish.
At the start, even the currency boards were seen as unacceptable, though, as is often the case in Europe, exceptions have been made: countries with a currency board could keep them even after union membership.
The opposition of the ECB and the Commission for the early adoption of the euro is ill-informed.
What should count for the European Union remains that the policies of any member state are not harmful to the other member states.
As Leszek Balcerowicz, governor of the National Bank of Poland pointed out, the adoption of the Euro by the candidate countries will certainly benefit them while, in the worst case, having absolutely no effect on the current members.
Indeed, the combined economic weight of all the candidate nations is much too small -- only 6% of GDP of the expanded EU -- to exert any effect whatsoever on the Euro.
However, the continuing opposition to EU institutions has led most of the candidate nations to abandon the idea of adopting the Euro unilaterally or as soon as possible after their entry into the Union.
Unfortunately, the persistence of the ECB and of the Commission now provide ammunition to populist governments in the accessing countries who rely on the variation in exchange rates to escape fiscal discipline that implies adopting the euro.
However, such fiscal manoeuvers probably discalify a country that wants to go quickly in the euro zone.
In fact, member nations which have not established a spending cap have seen their budget deficits soar -- beyond 9% of GDP in Hungary in 2002 and more than 5% in Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia -- while significant capital movements have exerted strong pressure on their currencies causing them to rise.
This trend sets out the real economies of the candidate countries to the risks of reversal of capital flows and exchange crises that an early adoption of the euro would eliminate.
Ironically, the candidate nations find themselves being lectured to by officials of the ECB and the Commission on the compromise between nominal convergence and real convergence.
It would appear that Brussels' only imperative is the targeted growth of candidate countries, and that macroeconomic stability can wait.
Large budget deficits support growth, and inflation is clearly not a problem.
If this reasoning sounds familiar, it is perhaps because it repeats more or less the foundations of the non sustainable planning system in which the accession of candidate countries was suspended in the early 1990s.
It was, of course, the adoption of economic policies that focused on market forces in the former communist countries who brought them to the gates of EU membership.
Thus, the European institutions should abandon their paternalistic approach and take the concerns of the central banks of candidate countries seriously on the subject of the risks associated with maintaining their own currency over a long period during which their economy must be fully opened up to the movement of capital.
Today, the ECB and the European Commission give their de facto support to the positions of the populist governments in Eastern Europe which are already spending the funds they expect to get from the EU in the future.
It is high time that European institutions address in a more serious fashion the challenges and opportunities expansion presents.
They may start by considering the early adoption of the Euro by the candidate countries in a more favorable eye both for countries with a currency board system for those using a floating exchange rate.
Blair's European disaster
When the Dutch and French voters rejected the proposed EU constitution, everyone quickly realised that the European project was in a difficult situation.
The painful battle of last week in regard to the medium term future of the budget of the Union has further confirmed this verdict.
She also regretfully brought an end to the British presidency of the European Council, recalling that Britain continues to maintain its long-standing reputation of standing apart from the European Union.
The two facts are inextricably linked.
In France and Holland, voters have not explained why they voted against the draft constitution.
However, many commentators have believed that this vote expressed their protest against the admission of the ten new states, which was felt to be too hasty, especially with respect to the poorest countries of central and eastern Europe.
More specifically, it would seem that the voters have been afraid of losing their jobs to swarms of immigrants coming from the East. This fear has been widely illustrated during this time by the image of the inexpensive Polish plumber.
The irony, of course, is that most of the fifteen old member states have refused to the new member states full and immediate access to Western job markets.
In any case, it was too late to protest since the ten eastern countries had actually become full European Union members.
But now, the 25 states must face the economic consequences of this growth, not only on the issue of the size of the entire European budget for the next seven years, but also on the distribution of donor and recipient countries.
The key issue above all is knowing how much the older member states are prepared to pay to boost the lagging economies of the new member states.
In fact, the battle took place on three fronts and opposed Britain, France and the new member states.
Traditionally, a large majority of the budget went to agriculture and regions where development was lagging.
In practice, huge sums of money have been attributed whether to the major agricultural producers, whether to the poorest members such as Greece and Portugal.
At these two levels, the new member states expected to benefit significantly from the EU system.
Previously, in budgetary terms, the biggest loser as a result of the European measures was the United Kingdom. At the time when two-thirds of European spending was going toward agriculture, its agricultural sector was weak, and therefore the British benefitted little from European agricultural subsidies.
For a long time, they have complained about the unfairness of these rules, especially since at that time, the United Kingdom was one of the poorest members. It is in 1984 that the conservative government of Margaret Thatcher demanded and obtained a massive rebate on the  net contribution of Britain to the EU budget.
Today, the situation has changed in three key points. First, the reform of the European agricultural policy has begun and the proportion of the European agricultural budget has fallen from 60 to 40%.
Then, for many years Britain had a faster economic growth than most other member states so that it has become one of the richest countries in the EU, even in comparison with France and Germany. Finally, the new member states are so much poorer that the poorest of the old member states that they have a moral argument weight to ask a for a generous budget negotiation.
The start of negotiations, six months ago, coincides with the start of the presidency of the European Council.
Tony Blair, British Prime Minister, has galvanized politicians in Europe by declaring before Parliament in Brussels that he was "passionately pro-European."
That was the message that the British pro-Europeans hoped for a long time and that they expected vainly since the election of Blair in 1997.
Of course, he never expressed such a feeling when he was actually in Great Britain, over the course of the last eight years.
In addition, since Britain has been one of the strongest advocates of expansion regarding the countries of central and eastern Europe, one might have expected that, during budget negotiations, the Blair government would have behaved with a proportional amount of generosity and enthusiasm towards the new entrants.
Initially, this seemed to be the tactics chosen by the British government.
But contrary to all expectations, it adopted an ethically advantageous position in proposing to give up part of its budget rebate, on the sole condition that the rest of the European Union (and France, in particular) agree on the fundamental reforms in terms of European agricultural policy.
It took time for the British to understand that since President Jacques Chirac was a shaky and desperate president, remaining in the Élysée until 2007 but possessing no power, he did not have the means to make such a bargain.
Once the British became aware of this harsh reality, they played their pitiful last card in the handling of the negotiations. They made ridiculously paltry offers, all primarily designed to safeguard Britain's petty interests and did so mainly at the expense of the new member states.
How sad conclusion to a presidency opened with great fanfare, six months ago by the statements passionately pro-European of Tony Blair!
The full text of his speech is clear.
Blair is favorable toward Europe, but not toward this one.
He wants to be part of a political Europe, but only if the other member countries agree to follow the model of economic and social reform.
The problem is that economic and social reform is purely and simply a matter of national policy and is not part of the powers of the Union. If such a reform must take place in France or in Germany, this issue would be discussed only between politicians and the French or German voters.
It could be within the competence of the Union only if the EU becomes a real federation.
Can you say Blair is a federalist, then?
Of course not!
It is mostly a mindless nationalist who lives in fear of the sneaky tabloid press in his country.
Then, why did he assert his pro-European fervor?
Maybe he didn't reflect on the issue in the end.
Europe in the challenge of neoliberalism
For more than 20 years I have argued that the high rates of unemployment in Western Europe could not persist.
At the end of the 1970s, monetarists made a bet that only a modest and temporary increase in unemployment could contain the rampant and open-ended inflation of the industrial West, and that with this recession the cost of the return to effective price stability would have proved worthwhile.
In Britain and the United States, this monetarist challenge has seen a happy ending.
Not in Western Europe.
Over the past 25 years, European unemployment has increased as the monetary policy does, and interest rates were raised to combat inflation.
But while inflation has yielded, unemployment has not fallen, or almost not.
Even if the unemployment rate has not reached the level of the Great Depression, it has remained high enough to make long-term unemployment,, or the fear of long-term unemployment, a truly disturbing experience.
The governments of societies in which the official unemployment rate remains at 10% or more for several generations have poor economic management.
Consequently, it seemed to me for 20 years that the balancing act underlying the policy in Western Europe, collective bargaining and generous social insurance on one hand, and tight monetary policies on the other, was doomed to crack.
The European policymakers seem paralyzed by a double fear.
Europe's central bankers fear that their political masters order them to relax their monetary policy, that the structural reforms needed to release the aggregate offer be not given and that this results in a return to the inflation of the 1970s..
In short, they fear that all the sacrifices made to stabilize prices have been fruitless.
Politicians in Western Europe, on their part, fear the opposite effect.
They are concerned with the idea that, even after undertaking structural reforms to reduce the attractiveness of unemployment insurance, and motivate workers to go to businesses and companies to workers, central bankers will continue to press for tightening the purse strings.
In short, they fear that without increased production and employment, the net effect will simply be an increase in poverty.
Of course, these fears are accompanied with the hope that the structural reforms and monetary expansion work in harmony, provoking a boom in employment and production without causing substantial increase in inflation.
But the reality is that not any move towards the loosening of monetary policy has been put in place, particularly with the novice European Central Bank , keen to assert its credibility in the fight against inflation -- and that attempts to structural reforms are hesitant, cut and undertaken without enthusiasm.
I have been wrong for 20 years: Western European regimes have remained stable despite the exclusion of a large proportion of citizens from meaningful participation in the economic life.
The growth of economies in Western Europe countries has continued, despite the heavy burden that is 10% unemployed, but did not do so as quickly as it could.
Today, it seems, I am finally right, if it's not time to panic, at least it's time for me to worry.
The French have rejected the EU constitution, above all (at least according to appearances), because a greater European integration is feared to result into enormous costs and the disruption of neoliberalism.
It's one thing to support the "European project" when it comes to linking Germany and France so closely that nobody considers it worthwhile anymore to go to war to determine what language should be spoken in Alsace-Lorraine.
It is another matter when the European project means that French workers will have to face competition from Polish plumbers, Roumanian farmers and Turkish vendors.
In Germany, voters seem poised to evict the Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, because his lukewarm allegiance to the neo-liberal project displeases them.
The problem is that they may find themselves governed for four years by Angela Merkel, a Chancellor almost as committed to the neo-liberal project as I am.
I believe that Germany would be better in ten years, with more neoliberal policies.
But that does not appear to match the desire of German voters, making it impossible to predict what German politics will be like in four years.
Besides, you have to add in the displeasure of northern Europe with respect to the central bankers, particularly of the ECB, and with respect to the Euro.
Not that the end of the European monetary union is decided, but it is simply that some have begun to consider a bleak future where the end of the EMU would be put to the program.
This is enough to shake asset prices around the world.
The successes of Western Europe since World War II are among the most impressive and the most encouraging success of world history.
Everyone should hope that the united Europe today builds on these successes, rather than see generations of high unemployment rates put them in danger.
For this, the ECB's attitude will have to change.
Europe needs a monetary policy considering that the decrease in the Northern European unemployment rate is more important than the price stability of the continent.
The southern and eastern Europe will suffer inflation, it is unavoidable, because as the regions develop and industrialize, the terms of trade improve, and under the auspices of a monetary union, regional inflation can become a barrier to overcome.
The ECB should not try to balance the inflation in the southern and eastern with the deflation of the north attempting to reach artificial targets in the scale of the entire continent
Rescued by taxes
What do we owe to our great-great-great grandchildren?
What measures do we have to take today to reduce the risks posed to our descendants and our planet by the increasing likelihood of global warming and of climate change?
Almost all the world -- except for Exxon Mobil, US Vice-President Dick Cheney, their appointed servants and their manipulated acolytes -- understands that when human beings burning hydrocarbons, the carbon dioxide escapes into the atmosphere, where it acts as a massive cover that absorbs the infrared radiation emitted underneath, resulting in the warming of the planet.
Similarly, almost everyone understands that global warming could be whether more serious, or less serious than existing models suggest, but that this uncertainty is not an excuse to do nothing.
In fact, it should instead prompt us to better protect ourselves if we knew that global warming would occur exactly according to the average projections.
Finally, almost everyone agrees that governments, nonprofit organizations and oil companies should designate more money for research on carbon dioxide emission free energy technologies, or those able to remove pollutants from the atmosphere and oceans, cooling the planet by reflecting more solar radiation.
It is clear that it is the rich countries which must shoulder the burden of solving the problem of climate change over the course of the coming generations.
After all, they were allowed access to industrialization and wealth by polluting blithely.
Today, China, India and other fast-developing countries do not have this freedom of movement and it would be unfair to penalize them.
It is time now to build, not dismantle or undermine the international institutions which will have to manage our response to climate change in the coming years.
But should we do something different now and during the next decade?
Economists like to think in terms of cost.
And when they note a behavior with destructive side effects, they like to tax it.
The tax forces people to feel the damage they cause where it hurts -- in the pocketbook.
Imposing a tax on those who drive 4x4s in the city, for example, is a way to spur the collective intelligence to decide that adverse side effects are a good reason to change its behavior.
But it must be a fair tax.
A 4x4 that runs through 17 miles in the city and uses 3.7 litres of petrol, pumps about 3 kilograms of bioxyde of carbon into the atmosphere.
Should the "greenhouse" tax be 0,010 €, 0.38 or €1.15 per litre?
This choice will be determined by what we will learn over the years, but today, the amount of tax stems more from a philosophical question: how much do we think we owe our distant descendants?
Australian economist John Quiggin posted an informative discussion on his Web site (
However, critics of this calculation stress that the world today is poor. The average annual per capita, at purchasing power parity, stands at about €5,500.
One expects the improvement of technologies and their dissemination to make the world much richer by 2100: With an annual growth of 2 percent, it will reach almost 40,000 euros per head in terms of 2006 purchasing power.
These critics argue therefore we have much more need today of this  €55 marginal expense than people richer in 2100 will need the €400 that they would earn by being preserved the effects of climate change.
But what critics often fail to mention is that the same logic applies to today's world.
The average annual per capita income is now around €30,600 in the US, Japan and Western Europe and less than €4,600 for half of the poorest people in the world.
The same logic according to which we need €55 today, more than people from 2100 quote will need the additional €400, means the rich should be taxed more, since every additional €380 in taxes in rich countries corresponds to an increase in per capita income of €55 in poor countries.
In other words, if the rich are stingy today toward our much richer descendants, and if we decide to let them get by with an ecological disaster, we must now be generous with the poor of this world.
Conversely, if we are greedy today with the poor, we need to be generous with our descendants.
At least that is what we should do if our actions are based more on moral principles than on the leitmotif of Leonid Brezhnev: "What we have taken, we keep."
Take pharmacovigilance seriously
Health threats -- nuclear reactors, firearms and contaminated food -- threaten all of us; it is why governments are playing an active role in limiting them, by means of regulations which are often successful.
But the situation is very different when it comes to the safety of prescription-only medicine.
In fact, for the regulator, the pharmacovigilance is the forgotten relation of public protection.
The scope of the problem is yet enormous.
In the United States alone, it is estimated that side effects are responsible for the deaths of 100,000 patients each year.
If these figures are valid, it means that deaths caused by drugs rank fourth or fifth among the leading causes of death (according to the mortality estimates used).
In addition, the annual hospital costs directly attributable to adverse effects would run into the billions of dollars, not to mention the suffering caused by side effects which don't lead to hospitalization or death.
The difficulties of determining causes and effects should be taken into account.
It is sometimes difficult to know if the death or hospitalization of a patient is attributable to a particular drug, the underlying illness or a combination of both.
This phenomenon only underlines the need to ensure the safety of medicines.
The fact that all drugs, in addition to their benefits, produce adverse effects in some patients is one reason why pharmacovigilance exists.
It is necessary to weigh carefully the beneficial and undesired effects of medicines before approving them and using them.
These judgments vary, depending on whether they are issued by a pharmaceutical company, which expects the benefits of its sales, or by a patient who risks suffering a serious side effect.
The incomplete nature of knowledge complicates this estimate.
The rush to put new medicines on the market often leads to an incomplete research on their safety.
More than half of approved drugs cause a serious side effect that was unknown at the time they were authorized for sale.
One example: when the new class of analgesics called Cox-2 inhibitors  was put on the market, regulators, doctors and patients were unaware that these medicines could cause heart attacks and strokes.
Tens of thousands of innocent patients, perhaps more, have suffered from side effects before the withdrawal of the first two drugs in this class.
It is difficult to provide a complete and appropriate list of the harmful effects of drugs.
The rate of spontaneous alerts to the regulatory agencies is low, around 1%, and controls are passive in many countries.
One must also count with the general reluctance to report the adverse effects of drugs.
Doctors sometimes feel guilty and fear trials, and pharmaceutical companies are concerned about threats to their profits. The regulatory agencies must confront the question, "why this drug has been allowed?"
It is particularly difficult to blame adverse reactions to a drug when the symptom is common in the age group of the user or treated disease.
Because the risk of heart attack is important in the elderly, many  suffer from arthritis-related pain requiring treatment with painkillers, it took six years to make the link between Cox-2 inhibitors and a multiplication by two or three risk of heart attacks.
A recent Harris poll in the United States concluded that 60% of adults are either not very convinced or not convinced at all that drug manufacturers disclose their information on the undesirable side effects of their products.
This scepticism is justified: internal documents obtained from recent trials show that pharmaceutical companies often fail to submit critical safety information to the regulatory agencies, as the law requires, and fail to pass this information along to doctors and patients.
One of the problems is that the consequences of this neglect of the harmful effects of drugs are nonexistent or minimal.
It is time to be serious.
· Citizens and governments must make pharmacovigilance a priority, and commit the resources needed to solve the problem.
• The penalties imposed on pharmaceutical companies which fail to raise an alert and provide information on the safety of their medicines should be increased substantially to make them an effective deterrent.
The agencies in charge must have the means of enforcing the laws in order to implement stricter regulations.
• Pharmacovigilance's problem has to be considered a failure of the system.
It is not fair to blame serious adverse effects on doctors, particularly in the absence of comprehensive information on the safety of medicines.
The full cooperation of doctors is essential to solve the problem, but it means an end to their fear of being dragged in court.
This approach works well in the aviation industry: the pilots who point out the mistakes that they have nearly made are not penalized.
Patients must be better informed about the risks of medicines that are prescribed to them and more involved in their diagnosis and their reporting.
Instructions printed in tiny letters are useless.
• the control of side effects should be more proactive.
This calls for more funding, which should come from the main beneficiaries of the sale of medicines: the pharmaceutical industry, in the same way as the monitoring of air safety is funded by the airlines.
Above all else, improving pharmaco-vigilance will depend, if we want the efforts to succeed, upon the establishment of an independent body designed to promote, coordinate and give advice to the program of regulation.
The office exists in the United Kingdom.
Other governments should follow this model in order to fulfill their role, neglected so far, as the guardian of public health.
The virtual enemy
Five years have passed since the terrorist attacks of September 2001 on New York and Washington, and yet it seems that policymakers have learned little about how terrorist cells work and their weaknesses.
The Bush administration always uses the expression "war against terrorism" and behaves as if it were really a regular kind of war   where one government is in combat with another.
However, after five years of military efforts, strategies based on the targeting of a single opponent have only worsened the situation.
It is time to understand the new model of conflict that is currently emerging.
So that the paradigm "war" would work, the Bush administration referred to al Qaeda as a definite enemy.
In reality, there is no great organiser or financing of terrorist activity.
The attacks in Madrid, Bali and London, and several attempts thwarted the United States and Great Britain, were all marked by their scattered organisation.
It is conspiracies generated independently who have used the resources of ad hoc, often at home.
These small operations also lacked a common internal pattern.
The motives of terrorists differ from cell to cell, even from person to person.
Individuals can be motivated by profit, or the thirst for power, or for political and religious reasons, while others are acting out of hatred or out of high anxiety.
In addition, there are big differences in terms of risks, rewards and imperatives as one climbs the organizational chain or moves from one unit to another.
Conventional military models are equipped to decapitate something which, in this particular case, has no head.
The features of this new structure have already been studied in very different circumstances.
Terrorism is the violent version of an "agile virtual company".
A virtual company is a small group that assemble alone in an organization just large enough to implement a collective intention.
Virtual companies are unusually innovative, and in business, they are doubtless the only system capable of effectively creating a unique product.
The industry of film production is a blatant example of this.
In fact, it is without a doubt the business model of the future.
Profits from virtual corporations come from their casualness in terms of stability.
At present, most of the price of a product finances the huge and inefficient organization which assembled it.
Almost all the creativity and problem solving occur in small businesses and are "integrated" later by big companies, those whose infrastructure is expensive and fragile, and that retain the bulk of profits.
This model is the basis of the business world today, just as centralization has been its preferred defense strategy.
When you buy a General Motors car , 80 cents of every dollar spent goes back to GM, which manages itself almost alone.
Small suppliers provide you in fact with 80% of the value and innovation, but only receive 20% of the reward.
Ironically, in-depth research on alternative models has been funded by the US Department of Defense, which, as the biggest buyer of complex machinery in the world, wanted better quality goods, cheaper and made to order besides.
This research uncovered the requirements and mechanisms necessary for facilitating the autonomous establishment of small opportunistic groups and for enabling them to act like large companies.
Unfortunately, the research programme was cancelled before its findings could be applied to the business world, surely because it threatened big business.
It is often forgotten that American Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld has abandoned a comfortable retirement to reorganize the American army into a smaller and more agile force, using some of these ideas.
But the organisation of the invasion of Iraq, for which Rumsfeld had recommended the use of fewer troops than expected, shows a poor understanding of distributed systems.
While the troops were deployed with the goal of a quick and easy entry and exit, the Bush administration ended up using them for an old-style occupation.
The terrorists have shown a greater talent for capitalizing on the distributed models of operations.
A multitude of books is coming out in the Muslim world on strategic studies of jihad.
The most famous in the West is the Management of Savagery [the management of  brutality], but only because it has been translated and made public.
These books (and the trends they indicate) are becoming less dogmatic and increasingly complex in terms of adoption of the modern techniques of management.
Their research will surely include the young science of management of the virtual company: how to feed and support self-organized cells.
The first lesson for decision makers in the West to learn is perhaps the virtual companies rely on a culture of trust.
Some kinds of confidence can be based on an artificial concept of 'not us' rather than real values and direct experience.
This is why the actions of the Bush administration only reinforce the dynamics of online terrorist activity.
Bush's rhetoric "them and us" clearly defines an "other" and positions it as a cohesive enemy.
His "war" approach helps Islamic terrorists consider the West as a force just as united and malicious.
In the future, the model of the virtual company will shape the way business will be conducted, the way wars will be fought, and probably the way government services will be administered.
He promises to separate financial management from production management, which would imply increased innovation and more rapid economic growth.
However, if Western governments do not develop a deep understanding of how to operate these structures, they have no chance of combatting agile terrorist activity.
Expansion as a solidarity
Nowadays, it is often said that the European Union's sense of solidarity has been put in danger, not to say that it has exploded, by expanding to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
With Bulgaria and Romania approaching their turn to gain entry into the EU, and with the negotiations which have to be opened with Turkey and Croatia, it has become essential to call this notion into question.
The values and interests of the new EU members are most often consistent with those of the first 15 states.
It is true, of course, that expansion has fundamentally changed the Union and gave birth to new problems and political questions.
However, the new member states of Central and Eastern Europe are deeply embedded in the economic, social and cultural development of our continent.
The ties that bind us have been eroded by 40 years of Soviet rule, but this has not changed fundamentally the European nature of these countries.
My country, Poland, has always had deep cultural ties with other European countries, particularly France.
We participated in all the major European developments in terms of music, literature and cinema (such as, for example, Andrzej Wajda's Solidarity-era films such as "Danton," a French co-production.)
In sports too, eastern Europeans have for a long time been included  with the rest of Europe.
Indeed, before the first world war, the national football team in Germany was entirely composed of players with Polish surnames.
But, above all, there is a profound sense among the Poles, the Hungarians, and the Czechs as well as others who all feel they are Europeans.
Which is the true meaning of the word "solidarity" as the Petit Robert dictionary defines it: "relationship between people who are aware of a commonality of interest".
Solidarity as meaning a unit resulting from common interests also clearly exists in the 15 original members that members of the enlarged Union today.
The exceptions prove the rule.
The lack of unity in the European Union on the Iraq issue should not overshadow the agreements that the member states have reached on all the other important issues of international affairs.
For the economic questions, disagreements on a single regulation of the European Union, for example, should not obscure the fact that no member state, new or historic, has ever challenged the EU market.
Finally, the enlargement process itself is clearly a symbol of a social, civil and cultural European unity.
The fact that it provoked debate and discussion does not contradict the conviction shared by all, old and new member states alike, that they have an obligation to rebuild a continent after 40 years of division.
There remain a few questions which, if they are not the source of basic division, are disturbing.
Should we fear that Europe is now a continent purely Judeo-Christian and white?
Will the European Union's citizens whose origins are in other continents and whose religion is Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Buddhist be able to identify with "European" values and culture?
Are they able to feel European, as the Poles and Czechs have always done?
These questions are especially valuable, in fact they cannot be avoided, in the case of Turkey's possible admission to the European Union.
Is European integration driven by respect for the values of others?
Is it a matter of sharing them or contributing to it?
These are tricky questions.
They are particularly difficult if we look at culture as the cement of Europe's future.
All European countries probably thought at the beginning that non-European newcomers would be assimilated in the same way that the Polish immigrants were assimilated in the Ruhr German in the 19th century.
The fact that this has not happened, at least on a large scale, does not mean that this cannot happen.
One should only look at the number of respectable citizens of Turkish origin living in Germany.
Or the large number of second generation British Indians and Pakistanis that we now see wearing a tie, laptop in hand, always between two aircraft.
Europeans must however admit that these people represent only a minority.
A number of groups of immigrants in Europe are themselves rejected by their communities because of the impossible social and economic integration.
The constant threat of terrorism has made the insulation of Islamist groups in Europe even more dramatic.
The European Union cannot simply declare "solidarity" a core value and do nothing to encourage it among those who feel marginalized.
They must be allowed, also, to feel this "relationship between people who are aware of a community of interest".
The European solidarity cannot survive this neglect and will not survive it.
After Kyoto
The treaty of the Kyoto Protocol is now in force for the 126 nations who have signed it so far.
It is now time to begin to question the following: how to bring all the nations, including the major emitters, to discuss what actions to undertake after after the expiration of the treaty in 2012?
That is exactly what the European Commission has done recently in unveiling its first strategy for a post-Kyoto era, which will be examined by the European Council this coming March.
While the Kyoto Protocol is only a modest reduction of carbon emissions in industrialized countries (5.2% between 2008 and 2012 compared to 1990 levels, with variable targets depending on the country), real progress can be made by supporting the development efforts and preserving our planet.
In the first place, all countries must include climate concerns in the planning of their policies and improve their governance in key sectors such as energy, infrastructure and transport.
In other words, we must act by being aware that climate change and its effects on the inhabitants of rich and poor countries remain a threat to world security.
Ultimately, the long-term approach will probably include a system based on some rules, a system of incentives and some investments in the area of technological change.
The adaptation at national level will be increasingly recognised as a major issue that will require adequate funding.
The treatment of the effects of climate change and the treatment of emissions reductions should not rule each other out, but be complementary.
Imagining the post-Kyoto world will offer us a chance to start a new dialogue and to consider new options for climate change.
The nations could establish a more ambitious goal which would be to limit long-term change in the Earth's temperature, then allocate emissions rights among countries so as to ultimately restrict  temperature increases to an acceptable level.
That would require to increase energy research and development in order to develop both new and better technologies, a process that must be supported by more solid partnerships between the public and private.
Until now, with only 15% of the world population, rich countries are responsible for more than 75% of global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), and therefore most of the environmental damage.
It is however developing countries (and therefore poor countries around the world) who are most vulnerable.
It is unrealistic to ask the poor countries, where more than 1.6 billion people do not have access to energy and clean technologies, to support the costs associated with technological change as expected.
In collaboration with its partners, the World Bank supports financial strategies which aim to help developing countries regulate costs due to climate change.
To date, more than $1 billion invested in GEF projects (Global Environment Facility - funds for the global environment) and around $8 billion placed in co-financing, have been used in programs related to climate change.
While the regulatory mechanisms of Kyoto and the European system of tradeable emissions (European Trading Scheme) have contributed to the creation of an emerging market for carbon trading, interested parties are now worried about the immediate future.
Without regulatory framework after 2012, the new opportunities for engaging transactions based on projects will end by 2006/2007.
Given the long delay between the preparation of projects and the first benefits of emission reductions, project developers only have a few years to act before carbon payments stop making a significant contribution to financing projects in the current context.
The development of projects related to infrastructure is a long process that requires between 3 and 7 years, from identification via licensing, financing and construction, to the first certification of reductions in carbon emissions.
The projects must therefore be operational by 2007 at the latest.
The World Bank has greatly contributed to forward the financing of carbon as a tool of sustainable development and to facilitate private sector's participation in the market.
The Bank is focused on the representation of the interests of its borrowing countries, helping them to develop assets for the carbon trade according to their own priorities.
But without the involvement of governments to limit greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2012, the carbon market will remain uncertain and the private sector (indispensable to the success of the market) should not extend its participation in a significant and lasting manner.
According to a recent study of companies interested in the financing of carbon, commissioned by the World Bank, only one company out of five surveyed said that it was interested in emissions reductions after 2012.
We now have the opportunity to turn toward the future and mobilize the global community (all of the countries without exception, albeit with different responsibilities) in the quest for a safer world, a world which would avoid the terrible risks of the environmental degradation and social conflict that go along with inaction.
State of the art or art of the State?
September is traditionally the month when orchestras and opera companies leave the festivals of Aix, Salzburg, Tanglewood and many others to return home.
This season is also marked (on both sides of the Atlantic) by the return of concerns as to the means of financing classical music.
The American Symphonic life is eurocentric in almost all areas except for its funding.
While Americans depend on private donations deductible from tax and revenue to fund classical music performances, Europeans prefer direct governmental support.
Ironically, while the defenders of the arts in the United States have long demanded the adoption of the "European model", which has produced a rich and varied artistic lifestyle, Europe is being forced to change course and to guide its support system towards greater dependence on private money and revenue.
Unfortunately, the European system of direct government funding is a victim of slow European economic growth and budget deficits.
The problem is especially for countries that have adopted the euro, as public spending in the art sector will be limited during a time by the obligation to keep the deficit below 3% of GDP.
The resulting pressure on the European institutions performing arts causes concern on several levels.
Traditionally, the European social democracies prefer to distribute scarce goods and services such as concerts and operas, according to a queue system (financed by huge subsidies to keep prices low) rather than by the willingness of each to pay.
That will change from now on.
Supporters of the Performing Arts in Europe point to the United States where, among others, even major orchestra conductors must actively participate in seeking funding and play an active role in the local community on behalf of the orchestra.
They fear that the same thing will happen in Europe.
Some conductors, refusing to handle the begging bowl at the same time as the baton, refused important positions in the United States for this reason, believing that it would upset their art.
It is said that Daniel Barenboim left the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in part because he objected to the demands for fundraising that were put upon him.
But the North American experience shows that getting big names in the art world, like the heads of orchestras, to participate in fundraising, does not necessarily harm the artistic aspect of the profession.
Michael Tilson Thomas in San Francisco, for example, has combined effective fundraising with artistic direction to place the San Francisco Symphony as one of North America's top orchestras.
The Europeans, concerned that greater dependence on private money inevitably means conservative programming, should also be reassured to see that the San Francisco Symphony has one of the most audacious repertoires in the United States.
If the public has progressive tastes, private money and innovative programming are entirely compatible.
The corollary is that public money makes possible an adventurous programming even if the public's taste has a tendency to be conservative.
This is one reason why artists in Europe like public money; it frees them from a repertoire of only Beethoven and Mozart.
In addition, the public can come to appreciate a daring plan if someone proposes it to them.
Of course, if the public founds are reduced regarding showbusiness, not only these one will have to depend more of private founds, but the price of tickets will have to increase.
Some complain, and prefer the system of queuing for tickets because they fear that higher prices will compromise future audiences by excluding youth.
But low prices for the performing arts do not solve the thorny issue of young people's access.
First, young people may not take advantage of cheap seats, simply because whatever the cost, classical music does not interest them.
Then, even if they want to go there, it is sometimes impossible for them to get tickets, which are often no longer available because the subscriptions stay in the same hands year after year.
What is the interest of low prices, which serve mainly to subsidise the same subscriptions holders, if there is no room?
If the taste for classical music has to be subsidized, one must favor  better-targeted grants rather than low prices.
The best way to attract youth to the performing arts is to go through education.
Given that American orchestras can't count on schools or the government to provide the basic music education to ensure an ongoing audience for classical music, some orchestras are doing it themselves with private money.
In San Francisco, for example, the Symphony is running a project called Keeping Score, financed with private funds of up to $23 million, which includes a national TV series, radio broadcasts, an interactive music apprenticeship and school music programs.
This type of innovative program applies as much to European orchestras as to American.
The problem of youth and its access to the performing arts exists on both sides of the Atlantic.
Just like the poor quality of music education in the public schools.
If the orchestras don't take care of their own future, they may simply not to have one.
Respect for the law, Russian-style.
Throughout the world, we are concerned with the disappearances of political freedoms in Vladimir Putin's Russia.
The Russians themselves are practically the only ones not to worry about this creeping authoritarianism.
They seem less concerned about political freedoms that with social protection: pensions, family violence, children's rights or police brutality.
In fact, most Russians are indifferent to the government's efforts to restrict freedom of press and the right to protest.
This apathy makes my job as a mediator, a position established in the Duma (parliament) to protect political rights in Russia, difficult, if not impossible.
The ombudsman serves as a bridge between authorities and the people; he tries to resolve conflicts between state organs and ctizens.
My office is open not only to Russian citizens, but also to foreign nationals and stateless people who believe that their political rights have been threatened.
We apply the Russian constitution, but also the principles of international law and standards on human rights, sometimes even in contradiction to our Constitution.
For example, as a mediator, I am opposed to the restriction of the right of the Russians to be jurors.
Those who wanted to limit the use of panels supposedly feared for national security.
My office worked closely with the state to ensure that most of the trials proceed with jury.
Similarly, my office has defended the weekly liberal Novoe Vremya, subject to pressure by the City of Moscow on the pretext of trade litigation concerning a lease.
The dispute is not resolved, but following my speech, the Moscow authorities were forced to take account of the negative public attitude to their attempts to censor the newspaper.
Of course Russia provides examples of problems relating to the fundamental political freedoms and much more in the headlines, as the dirty war in Chechnya or the Yukos affair.
My office concerns itself with Chechnya as much as possible, although this is not easy from Moscow.
I could spend all my time there, but Russia has 89 regions and innumerable human rights problems to solve.
This is why I suggested to Mr Putin that Chechnya be given its own regional mediator permanently.
The new Chechen authorities appear to be delighted.
With respect to the Yukos affair, my office cannot intervene in any ongoing legal proceedings.
The lawyers for the former Director General of Yukos, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, filed a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
If Khodorkovsky contests the final decision of the Russian courts, he will no doubt appeal before this juisdiction.
Only then will I be able to give my opinion.
Many observers insist, however, that people who are the subject of a criminal investigation should be released on bail and not in jail.
For others, this is not possible in Khodorkovsky's case: He is very wealthy and could easily escape justice and flee abroad.
That's precisely what's the other people accused in the Yukos affair did.
All these serious problems in the area of human rights highlight the incompleteness of Russian legal institutions.
For example, the Duma has put in much too much time passing a law concerning pressure groups, which in most advanced democracies clearly defines acceptable and unacceptable behavior.
Khodorkovsky perhaps would not have so much trouble if such laws existed.
But the lack of legislation is directly linked to the absence of clear ideas.
Human rights in Russia are often trampled simply because the people do not know they have those rights.
The most important objective for my office is that everyone learns to better defend their rights, and that the authorities take in account complaints of ordinary russian citizens.
Unfortunately, most of bureaucrats still despise the values of Human Rights.
But the real difficulty for my office is not ignorance nor legal loopholes: it is the fact that in a legal system inadequately developed as the one of Russia, my authority is essentially personal, and requires the support of the media.
The notions of human rights are still rudimentary, and can be expected as an awareness that spreads gradually.
My strategic objective is thus to make better known the mediator's office, in order to get more respect and recognition from the citizens and the state.
It is almost impossible without co-operation with non-governmental human rights organizations in Russia.
I also consider that one of my tasks is to encourage contacts between these groups and the authorities.
The government's response to these initiatives will help to better know whether and to what extent the Putin government intends to include the political and human rights in the framework of its "dictatorship of law".
The revolutionary conservative pope
Twenty-five years ago, the Polish people were surprised that one of them, Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Krakow, had been appointed to the papacy.
Some were frightened, others have shed tears of joy.
Here's, as a famous writer wrote, "the second Baptism of Poland."
But even in our euphoria, we did not expect the new pope to change not only Poland, but the entire world.
His first visit to his native country, shortly after his induction, showed the world the power of the new pope.
The communist police has disappeared from the main streets in Warsaw, the streets have become models of order.
After decades of being deprived of their independence, the Poles have suddenly regained their capacity for self-determination.
By saying out loud that "there can be no Europe without an independent Poland on its map," the pope has managed to sweep away the unfair post-war colonisation which had subjected Poland to Soviet power.
Then, at Auschwitz, the Pope said: "I speak on behalf of all those whose rights are unknown and trampled in the world, I speak because I am involved, we are all linked by the truth."
At this point, in this Golgotha of modern times, he called the Poles who remembered their families, gassed in the Auschwitz crematories and those who froze in the concentration camps in Siberia, in a brotherhood devoted to combating even justified hatred and revenge.
Some see the Pope as the man who has led a religious revival; others take him for a man of peace.
Some see him as a defender of the poor, others a criticism of the theology of liberation.
For the people of Poland, John Paul II, by making the human rights, the focal point of his teaching, will be forever the man who gave us the courage and hope, who has restored our historical identity.
Indeed, during the first decade of his reign, the Pope gave all his efforts to the fight against the dictatorship, and particularly the communist dictatorship.
The strategy made by the Pope for the Catholic Church and its ability to mobilize millions of believers to its cause have meant that no one can never repeat the question posed by Stalin: "How many divisions the Pope has?"
John Paul II demonstrated that moral strength was a weapon powerful enough to undo the division of the world established at Yalta.
Perhaps in part because of their staunchly anti-communist position, the Catholic Church and John Paul II often receive the label of ‘conservatives’.
This accusation suggests that the Church cannot cohabitate easily with a pluralist democracy.
In the fight against communism, the Polish church has certainly been rather conservative, thank God!
It has shown conservative in its absolute loyalty to the evangelical values, to the truth of faith and to its historical identity.
For a system which officially advocated atheism and legalized lying, the church has embodied a living reproach.
However, with the disappearance of communism, the problem encountered by John Paul II and his church at the moment is this: in what language can evangelical values be expressed in a world in which evil is not represented by a political system, but is present in each soul?
What is the message of the Pope for the post-communist world he helped to create?
John Paul II undoubtedly keep his distance with the liberal economic ideas wich he often treat as permissive and morally relative.
The Pope's statements on behalf of collective values are often marked by criticism of individualism.
He considers the shortcomings of liberalism as being particularly pernicious in the post-communist countries.
The market economy, despite its practical success, often seems, in his eyes, lacking of a heart and a human face.
He believes that the market promotes entrepreneurship at the expense of human solidarity.
John Paul II is not highly enthusiastic about modern western civilization, with its separation from the world of values, and he contrasts it with those societies which have just emerged from several decades of dictatorship.
As Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the pope has a tendency to believe that this is primarily in the resistance to totalitarianism that man can become truly free and safeguard the fundamental values of civilisation.
I confess that I consider the legacy of Communism with more skepticism.
Totalitarian pressure has in fact created exceptional men such as John Paul II and Alexander Solzhenitsyn, people who consider that religious faith has bought freedom from lies and solitude.
But it has also created men such as Andrei Sakharov and Vaclav Havel, who have defended their supreme values by referring to a secular humanism and speaking in its name.
However, for most people, life under a totalitarian dictatorship was certainly nothing ennobling; rather it acted as a daily immersion into lies, spiritual depravity and material corruption.
This is why the post-communist companies do not demonstrate nobility or show any disinterestedness that is notably different from the west.
The defeat of communism has left a large black hole in the souls of communities, a hole that is now filled by ideas of nationalism, intolerance and Western consumerism.
But the first hunch of John Paul II is correct: the post-communist world (the eastern and western) is a spiritual crisis and the Pope wishes to undermine it by leading it to realize the importance of values higher.
Indeed, by his words and the example he gives, the Pope disrupts the world: it wants to live in wealth and comfort, and the Pope reminds us that we also need to live with dignity.
No single label can apply to John Paul II who is often a mixture of contradictory characteristics: rejection of compromise/ecumenism, tenacity/enthusiasm, intellectual openness/insistence on theological orthodoxy.
This is a conservative lovers of freedom and a supporter of peace, which condemns the injustice, but that reminds us that Mercy is more important than justice.
It is in that matter that he embodies the paradox which Christianity represents: the sacred and sustainable principles associated with the understanding and tolerance.
Twenty-five years after the departure of John Paul II in Rome, we, the Polish, remain grateful for getting us to regain our freedom.
It is a good thing that John Paul II be with us.
A world in which everything changes needs a watchdog to look after what does not change.
The interventionist syndrome
Kosovo is often used as a test-case for the concept of "humanitarian" intervention.
But while Iraq enters into the spiral of chaos, diplomats and national leaders are wondering again if it is appropriate for the alliances of nations or the international community to intervene when a sovereign country seems unable or unwilling to defend its citizens against genocide, war crimes, or ethnic cleansing.
At the center of this debate is the so-called doctrine of "responsibility to protect."
As a mediator in Kosovo, appointed by the United Nations over five years I have had the unique opportunity to observe the effects of this doctrine after NATO intervention in the former Yugoslavia in 1999.
Kosovo has thus become an international example of society-building, conducted by the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).
Experience is the right word here.
Indeed, Kosovo has turned into a tube test of the international intervention.
I have lived and worked long enough in Kosovo to see the result, and I claim that such experiments require more thorough research.
It seems clear that the need for an international intervention in a crisis situation depends on each specific period, and a rapid response is often necessary.
However, setting aside military factors, where such interventions are considered it is vitally important to concentrate the international policy discussions on the rapid deployment of a civilian presence and on security ties between one another.
It is even more true when the human suffering is caused by the conflict of communities, as was the case in Kosovo.
The immediate deployment of a civilian presence and adequate security immediately after the end of the NATO bombing of 1999 could have provided appropriate means to protect against the backlash that allowed the victims to become executioners.
The peacekeeping forces of NATO were not tasked with preventing abductions and disappearances, revenge killings and the massive destruction of property by ethnic Albanians, which resulted in a large reverse ethnic cleansing of the non-Albanian (predominantly Serbian) population.
A consequence of this neglect, a residue of social and political venom pervades Kosovo.
Instead of calming the community conflicts, inter-ethnic hatred is fiercer than ever.
Besides the lack of civilian and security presence to reassure each community, the general lack of legal mechanism to quickly render justice for crimes committed during and after the intervention has created further tension.
This tension is so pervasive, in fact, that any hopes of wrapping up the necessary reconciliation process must now be delayed to the distant future.
Similarly, in Kosovo the international community has devoted little time to helping the former combatants onsider their collective responsibility for the atrocities, whethertheir personal involvement was directly or indirect.
Without such an effort, trying to improve the situation is tantamount to build a house on a pile of sand.
This lack of foresight and of projects in the aftermath of armed intervention is not only dangerous for the people officially "saved", it is also counterproductive.
When a humanitarian intervention is not structured to guarantee basic security, the underlying antagonism that inspired the intervention is, at its core, only strengthened, not diminished.
Six years after NATO intervention, Kosovo is farther than ever from stability and social peace.
Despite repeated assurances from the UN authorities that Kosovo is on the path of reconciliation and genuine autonomy, the NATO representatives indicate that there are plans to maintain a long-term military presence in the province to "ensure that the political process will be put in place with success."
This leads me to another key point: a possible exit strategy is as important to the success of any humanitarian intervention in the future that the entry strategy.
For international intervention to have a real chance of success, it is advisable from the beginning to define the criteria of "success."
One such clarity can properly be an end to the commitment of international players.
In Kosovo, such clarity is and has been lacking; as a result, NATO and the UN have no clear idea about the time or the means by which they must both withdraw.
One day, someone quite rightly said that it is easy to bomb, but much more difficult to rebuild; it is relatively easy to dissolve a military regime, but it is much more difficult to build a robust civil and durable society in its place.
The United Nations General Assembly should keep this idea in mind when it begins to codify the doctrine of "responsibility to protect."
The divisions of the right in Central Europe
Will Eastern Europe reach a certain political stability?
Since 1989, the election results did not stop oscillating between right and left.
Vicktor Orban, the young and bright Hungarian prime minister will he put an end to this situation ?
Thanks to a brutal program designed to absorb its political rivals on the right, Fidesz (the Hungarian Civic Union party) has come to have almost as many members as the Socialist Party on its left.
He also benefited from the internal conflicts in the Socialist Party, which have harmed one of its main assets: his strict discipline and professionalism, inherited from communism.
Vicktor Orban's efforts to gather the divided right under the banner of FIDESZ have been partial successful and are unique in Eastern Europe.
Since the collapse of communism in the Czech Republic, in Hungary, Poland and in Slovakia, the moderate right-wing parties are fragmented and lack a genuine political perspective.
Although these countries have not yet fully recovered from several decades of communist management, the divisions within the right have facilitated the election victory for the left, sometimes represented by former communists.
The right-wing forces in central Europe have to confront problems similar to those faced by right-wing parties elsewhere in Europe, where Social-Democrats, salvaging liberal ideas, manage to succeed in occupying all alone the center of the political chessboard.
In central Europe, this phenomenon was amplified by the fact that the ruling parties, of all political persuasions, had to privatize the economy and introduce under pressure from the European Union reforms which in the West would have been put in place by the right.
In several Central European countries, the left have been better positioned to accomplish these reforms than the right because, paradoxically, they have a greater legitimacy for that.
Many people believe that the socialists get involved in privatisation or attack social protection unless it is absolutely necessity.
In Central Europe, the fundamental problem of the right is its lack of a  clearly defined identity.
Although politicians of the moderate right wing formally claim  traditional ideologies, liberalism or conservatism for example, their electorate, little accustomed to Western political concepts, does not always understand the significance of these terms.
Numerous polls show that a significant part of the electorate of various countries in central Europe align themselves to the right, but decades of paternalistic communism have moved the center of gravity in the region far to the left.
Thus, a person can simultaneously declare herself liberal and ask that the government continue to subsidize the energy, education and housing.
Under the communist regimes, the ideology was just a vulgar instrument at the power service.
As this time, even today many people accept formally ideological labels, but does not want insofar as they can remove a tangible benefit in the short term.
This cynicism about ideologies leads to the electorate's abrupt changes of heart.
The problem of identity is further exacerbated by the upsurge of nationalism. Most of the central European countries in which the building of a national identity was delayed by communism succumb to nationalist sentiments that can be manipulated by politicians.
Although some of them say they are right-wing, the image of Vladimir Meciar, the former Slovak Prime Minister, are in fact populist and authoritarian demagogues.
The current situation of the right in the countries of central Europe is also explained by their history and tradition.
The political evolution in Czechoslovakia during the last 20 years of Communism has alienated the Czech Republic and Slovakia from Poland and Hungary.
While Poland and Hungary knew under communism an internal liberalization which has allowed a part of the activity to escape semi-officially to communist control, Czechoslovakia knew a strict neo-Stalinist regime after the Soviet invasion of 1968.
In 1989, when the communist regime collapsed, the Communist parties in Poland and Hungary have turned into left-wing parties, democratic and credible. They were able to effectively oppose the right-wing parties that were created.
But in Czechoslovakia, the rigid communist party has not been able to give birth to a Democratic Party, anchored to the left.
Faced with this gap, the moderate right wing had a free hand and was able to retain a certain unity until 1997.
But the lack of a strong opposition led to the collapse of the right, which had become divided and lost a common language.
In Slovakia, country where the nationalist sentiments have played an important role after 1989, the political forces do not split for the moment on a left-right axis.
The main political battles are taking place between the essentially antidemocratic nationalist and populist forces on one side, and the forces fighting for democracy on the other.
The threat of Meciar's return to power led all the Democrats, from both right and left, to stand up together.
Even in these circumstances, the right remains divided, thereby allowing a possible return to power by Meciar.
In Hungary, the right has been a victim of the opposition between the conservatives and the populists on one side and the liberals from mainly urban classes on the other.
The right-wing parties have not come to an agreement as to whether they need to align with the traditional ideologies inspired by the West or with a form of conservative nationalism like that of Hungary.
Although the current ruling coalition, made up of conservatives and populists, has achieved some successes, the moment of truth for the right has not yet arrived.
The Polish right wing represents the hardest case.
Its problems date back to the communist era, when the Solidarity trade union became the main movement of opposition against the communists, during the time that unions are generally left.
Since the fall of communism, various groups of Solidarity have wanted to embody the right, sowing confusion in the political discourse.
The Christian Democrat parties linked to the church and the liberal parties have been to some extent marginalized.
The situation is made more complex by the need to include the populist and nationalist parties. They are relatively strong, because they can rely on the farming community which is an important electoral base in Poland.
As in other post-communist countries, it is essentially the democratic forces of the left who have benefited from divisions of the right.
Fed up with WalMart?
Do you want to know what video clip will soon be making policymakers throughout the world tremble?
The economist Thomas Holmes, following a scenario that looks like a disturbing way the spread of a global epidemic, has prepared a dynamic map simulation showing the expansion of the United States Wal-Mart stores.
Starting with the epicentre in Bentonville in Arkansas, where Sam Walton opened his first store in 1962, huge Wal-Mart big-box stores [magasins-boîtes] have now multiplied to the point that the average American lives less than seven kilometers from one of these retailers.
It is interesting to note that the shops are changing like the petals of a flower; ever thickening and expanding.
Rather than jumping directly to the coasts, since 80% of Americans live within a radius of 80 km from the Atlantic or the Pacific, Wal-Mart has spread in a more organic and indirect way, with a chain of suppliers that is constantly expanding.
Even if every new shop steals some of the clientele of Wal-Mart stores in the vicinity, the effectiveness of supply steadily improving helps maintain the overall growth of the chain.
Love it or hate it, Wal-Mart is undeniably the perfect example of the costs and benefits of modern globalization.
Consumers spend considerably less there than in traditional stores.
For example, economists believe that groceries at Wal-Mart are 25% cheaper than in any other supermarket chain.
The difference in price for many other consumer products is even greater.
Consider this astonishing fact: along with some other stores of the same sort, like Target, Best Buy and Home Depot, Wal-Mart accounts for about 50% of the vaunted increase in productivity in the U.S. as compared to Europe over the course of the past ten years.
Fifty percent!
And the same kind of progress among the chains of Wholesalers account for 25% more!
The idea that Americans have become better in all things while the other rich countries stagnated is very wrong.
The miracle of US productivity and the emergence of trade in the style of Wal-Mart are practically synonymous.
I have nothing against these big hypermarkets.
They are a godsend for low income consumers, and offset in part the tepid growth in wages from which many of them have suffered over the course of the past two decades.
And I disagree with some of my friends who snub the Wal-Mart stores and claim there have never set foot.
As a consumer, I love the big-box stores.
It is also certainly the case of America's trading partners; Wal-Mart alone accounts for more than 10% of all American imports from China.
But I nevertheless have some reservations about the Wal-Mart model being used as a blueprint of global growth.
First, there is the question of its effect on the workers on low wages and on the smaller retailers.
The investigations reveal that, while remaining within the law, its social policies exploit the gaps in regulation, which, for example, allow it to escape the burden of healthcare costs for many employees (Wal-Mart provides health coverage to less than half of its employees).
And the arrival of these hypers in a community crushes long-established retailers, and often transforms the community's personality is a startling way.
Yes, up to a certain point, it is the price to pay for progress.
But the loss of aesthetics and community is not simply calculated based on statistics on income and prices.
The big-box stores are not really cute, hence the name [big boxes].
If their explosive growth continues over the next 20 years, will Americans one day consider their proliferation a spectacular example of the failure of growth models which are weighted toward the regional level?
Indeed, many Europeans, and others, would consider the  video simulation of Holmes replicating the development of Wal-Mart as a horror film.
The French may have invented the hypermarket, ancestor of the big box store, but they never intended to allow it to develop unrestricted.
The big question for Europeans is whether they can find ways to use some of the efficiency gains encapsulated by the Wal-Mart model without being overtaken by it.
For Americans, there is also the question  of knowing what to do when the big-box stores phenomenon will slow down.
If a large part of US productivity is truly reduced to nothing more than letting Wal-Mart and its supermarket cousins continue their insane expansion, what happens when this source of growth is exhausted?
The US economy has many other forces, including its financial system and its dominant position in terms of capital goods, but the fact is that the advantage of the United States in this sector has not yet been as striking as the Wal-Mart phenomenon.
It is curious to see how many people seem to think that the US will grow faster than Europe and Japan over the next ten years, simply because it happened during the last ten years.
Wal-Mart and its ilk are a central element of our modern era of globalization.
They are not really the epidemic that their explosive growth pattern resembles, but their emergence is not completely benign.
Those who wish to emulate the trends in US productivity must ask themselves today what they would think of the emergence of stores in the shape of boxes dotting their countryside, pulling wages down and causing the death of small retail businesses.
The Americans, meanwhile, must think where is the balance between aesthetics, community, and low prices.
Accept the science.
The economic progress in the long term is mainly allowed by the invention and the spread of improved technologies.
The scientific revolution has been made possible by the press prints, the industrial revolution in the steam engine and if India from the famine, it is thanks to higher yields, the so-called "green revolution."
The era of globalization that we live emerged with the spread of computers and Internet.
In this way, when we look for solutions to some of the most difficult world problems, we can also find them, at least in part, in new technologies likely to resolve old, seemingly insolvable problems.
Take the example of poverty in Africa.
All the possible explanations were made, and usually the finger focus on what Africans did wrong.
But a visit to African villages makes it clear that the problem is more conditioned by the fight for survival in poor physical conditions than by any other problem, inherent to African societies.
The African farmers produce about one third (or less) of food less per hectare than other farmers of the world, which led to a large-scale famine, exacerbated by the heavy burden of disease.
Malaria is a unique challenge of its kind, mainly due to the species of mosquitoes in Africa, which are particularly suited to transmitting the disease.
Other tropical parasitic diseases are also heavy curses on the continent.
Add to that the practical difficulty represented by the roads in poor condition and the scarcity of cars and trucks, and the economic isolation follows.
The challenges of survival are thus enormous.
Practical solutions are available however, because simple and inexpensive technologies can solve some specific problems.
We can overcome the low crop yields with improved seed varieties specially adapted to African conditions, combined with technologies to enrich the soil and water management.
Malaria can be controlled through new long life mosquito nets and a new generation of effective medicines.
Other tropical diseases can also be controlled, and practical technologies to get drinking water can reduce substantially diarrheal diseases.
Mobile phones, wireless local Internet, and more roads could contribute greatly to breaking the economic isolation of African villages.
The donor countries are always asking the Africans to change their trade policies, their government institutions, their administrations, and more.
Some of these changes are important but the rich countries go sometimes beyond their role by focusing on everything, except on how to finance and to introduce practical technologies to solve practical problems.
The mistakes of the wealthy countries would not be significant if the African countries had enough money to acquire the necessary technologies by themselves, but Africa is so poor that it needs financial assistance in order to escape from poverty.
The challenges of development in Africa are just one example of how difficult social problems can be solved thanks to the design and the spread of improved technologies.
The same will be a correct way to best solve the problem of climate change caused by man--one of these global problems is seemingly unsolvable.
For now, rich countries change the global climate by emitting millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide each year by the use of coal, oil and natural gas.
In the coming years, China and India will also significatly contribute to increase the amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
And yet no country, it is rich or poor, is keen to reduce energy consumption, concerned that such a move could threaten its jobs, its income and its economic growth.
The new technologies will provide a very important part of the solution.
Already, "hybrid" automobiles, which combine fuel and battery, can almost double the fuel efficiency and divide by two carbon dioxide emissions.
In addition, engineers have developed techniques for the capture and safe underground storage of the carbon dioxide resulting from the burning of coal for power stations.
This new technology can reduce by 80% carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production.
The costs are relatively modest.
Let us also consider the depopulation of the oceans due to overfishing.
The global demand for fish is increasing, as well as the world's capacity for fishing, which threatens certain species with extinction.
An improved aquaculture, where fish are raised in containers and fish-tanks, is still far from being a perfect technology, particularly for environmental reasons, and yet it is very promising.
During a recent visit to Africa, a prominent agronomist stated that in today's world, the scientist is closer than ever to the farmer, but farther than ever from the legislator.
Politicians do not understand science, and rarely seek the opinion of scientists and engineers when they want to solve big problems.
Everything is viewed in terms of politics and elections, and nothing is considered a technical problem requiring technological expertise, which is why African poverty is so often attributed to corruption rather than to environmental challenges.
It is easy to dismiss the suggestion that technology can be the solution.
After all, technological progress also requires good governance, market forces, effective universities and more.
Politics also has a role to play.
Anyway, it is time to recognize that governments are poorly equipped to understand sophisticated technological challenges and opportunities the world could benefit from, and that new systems are needed to ensure science and technology are accorded the necessary authority to tackle a broad range of global problems which are becoming more and more urgent.
It is time today that all the major international agencies and governments take responsibility to use the scientific expertise and technology they will need in the 21st century.
Unblocking the Situation in Latin America
One of the biggest headaches of the world economy is undoubtedly the poor performance of Latin America.
Since the early 1980s, Latin America has found itself blocked, with per capita income (when there was any) growing slowly in most of the region and with one major crisis after another.
Many policies have been attempted, particularly the liberalization of trade, the privatisation of inefficient state-owned companies and fiscal reforms.
However, something prevents Latin America to move forward.
The lack of robust growth is even more disconcerting in light of the many benefits and social achievements of Latin America.
The natural resources are abundant and the fertile earths abound.
The health conditions are fairly acceptable and all Latin American countries have made progress against illiteracy, the majority reaching at least 90% of adult literacy.
In addition, the fertility rates have fallen sharply, to reach a rate where the populations of many countries will stabilise probably for the next decades.
The condition of women has improved and the girls are granted equal access to education, with tuition rates higher than boys in many countries.
Latin America is undoubtedly known for its "macho" culture, but the rate of women in the working population continues to grow and they are occupying more and more high-profile social and political positions.
Latin America is glorified by other advantages over the long term.
Most of its citizens live on the coasts and enjoy privileged access to international trade, and others live in cities, another advantage for growth.
Indeed, the region is not poor, according to international standards, but rather mired in the area of average earnings, between the world's poorest countries and the high-income countries of North America, Europe and Eastern Asia.
Why, then, the surprising lack of real growth in the past 25 years?
I reject the responsibility on two unsolved but soluble problems.
The first has existed for centuries: social divisions whose origins date back to the European conquest of Native Americans in the 16th Century.
More than other countries, Latin America was born during a violent conquest.
The Europeans subjugated the Amerindian people and also brought back, especially in the Caribbean basin and in Brazil, massive cargoes of African slaves.
Societies have become racially and ethnically complex since European, Native American and African populations have practiced mixed marriage, but the trend over the long term of European dominance, of indigenous and African-American enslavement, and of strongly rooted poverty have deeply scarred societies in Latin America.
Even today, the income inequality of Latin America are among the world's largest, reflecting the old models of ethnic and racial division.
Income inequality casts a large shadow.
The rich have been fighting for a long time against the taxes needed to increase investment in the areas of education and healthcare for the poor, thus perpetuating profound social divisions and leaving many people without healthcare and without the skills required by global competitiveness.
The situation is improving today in some countries, such as Brazil, which bodes well for the future.
In other countries, such as Guatemala and parts of the Andean region, the social divisions are marred by violence and mistrust.
In addition to this problem, a fundamental failure of the economic strategy has been largely ignored, a failure that is reflected in the major difference between the discussions on public policy in Latin America and Asia.
In Asia, the public debate is about the technology: how can Asia can catch up?
The Asian governments act with determination to increase the scientific and technological capacities of their economies.
In Latin America, the world technological revolution is much less discussed and the national policies to promote science and technology reach rarely the forefront.
Resulting in Latin America not taking proper advantage of the world technological revolution.
The developing Asian countries now produce computers, semiconductors, pharmaceutical products and software.
By contrast, even the star seller in Latin America, Chile, remains largely an export economy based on resources, heavily focused on exports of copper and agricultural products.
These sectors are technologically sophisticated, but form a narrow base for long-term development.
The situation is far from hopeless.
Brazil has shown predispositions to be a technological goods exporting power.
It has succeeded, obviously, to export aircrafts and many consumer goods.
Mexico has also started to mobilize a considerable amount of technological know-how.
Argentina, Chile and other countries could become noteworthy agricultural producers, in the vanguard of the agro-biotechnology for example, if they bothered.
However, Latin American countries have not yet tried to trigger a technological revolution, certainly not with the level of importance, competence, commitment and financing of the Asian countries.
Such an upsurge could play a major role in the take-off of economic growth.
Such a policy would commit to significantly increase spending on research and development, as the developing Asian countries have done.
The Latin American countries must increase spending to reach up to 2% of GDP (currently 0.5%), in part through public support for laboratories and universities, and in part by benefits for research and development of the private sector. They must unroll the red carpet for high-tech multinational companies, as Asia did.
They also need to focus more on training in science and technology and encourage a greater proportion of students to receive a university education.
The government stipends for tuition and for new universities and bigger universities can play an expanded role, as can investment in computers and information technology in schools and communities.
The social and technological program will depend on each another.
Both of them are asking Latin American companies to invest more in the people who are affected by these programs, so that the Latin Americans can position themselves at the forefront with respect to global productivity.
If these investments touch every country in Latin America, both rich and poor, the prospects of the region will improve considerably.
The price of real estate: a house of cards?
The first important city to see a boom was London, around 1996.
This attitude spread to Los Angeles, New York and Sydney around 1997 and Paris in 1998, all the way to Miami, Moscow and Shanghai in 2001 and Vancouver in 2002.
These cities and others have seen house prices inflate since then. Prices have risen to at least 50% in fixed prices since 2000.
This was the source of major unexpected profits for owners, but also the source of a problem for anyone preparing to buy a property.
Today, the rise of home prices subsides in some of these big cities.
The growth rate in London and New York slowed down dramatically during the course of the last year, and it fell to about a 1% real increase since the second quarter of 2004.
In Sydney, the prices of homes actually fell during the second quarter.
Is it the end of the boom ?
No other city would benefit from it?
Worse still, could the mood of real estate markets lead to a drop in prices?
No one had foreseen this boom, so to predict its end is risky.
Housing prices have shown a strong upward movement against the post-holiday warnings.
Any prediction about the end of the boom requires an understanding of the reasons for its development in so many different cities.
Curiously, there is no generally accepted explanation because the ultimate causes of the boom are primarily psychological.
Economists prefer to discuss interest rates or unemployment statistics, concrete and knowable factors.
Of course, these indicators have a legitimate role to play in explaining the property markets, but they are simply not sufficient to explain the recent boom.
Three psychological causes emerge from all of that: first, a change to the public perception about the sources of value in a changing global economy and growing confidence the public has in the cities' "glamour" whose name is known internationally and finally the simple dynamic of exciting speculative bubbles.
Each factor deserves more attention if you want to understand the present market conditions and see the future price trends.
First, the world economy seems more chaotic than it was ten years ago.
Plummeting share prices in most countries since 2000 offer little reassurance as to most financial assets, encouraging the move to "safe haven investments," real estate in this case.
Moreover, terrorism is now seen as a problem for everyone; Indonesia, Spain and Russia have suffered their own tragedies.
We are reassured by investing in real estate, and there is little reason to expect an imminent change.
Fear and soaring real estate prices are encouraging each other.
Then, public confidence in the cities' international glamor is growing, thanks to the explosive growth of global communications through the Internet and mobile phone.
Just as we admire international celebrities, we recognize famous international centers of business, technology and culture - whose names are familiar to everybody, possessing universally a unique value.
As for fear of terrorism and the lack of confidence in the stock markets, the geographical celebrity seems elastic, not to say self-enforced: the more New York, Paris and London are famous, the more they are attractive.
Finally, the contagious speculation behind any bubble cannot be ignored.
The current boom has seen the contagion spread within markets and across markets, with rising prices fueling popular excitement and thus further fueling the rise itself, in the same city and then in other cities, until it reaches the other side of the globe.
Residents of Shanghai may not discuss real estate prices in London, but the leaders of public opinion in Shanghai know what is going on in London, and any boom in that city makes the possibility of a boom in Shanghai plausible.
In contrast to the two other psychological reasons, speculative contagion has a natural end.
A speculative bubble, which sustains itself solely on the reaction to rising prices, cannot continue indefinitely.
So, where will it take us?
Two of the psychological causes suggest a continuing increase in house prices while the third suggests the end of this rising movement one of these days, without saying when.
I'll bet that some highly attractive cities will continue to experience a slowing of growth in housing prices, then eventually a decline.
Historically, housing prices have always demonstrated strong movements, and prices in all of these cities are still going up at a significant rate, even if it is generally a bit slower than a year or two ago.
If we extrapolate the trends of growth, it seems reasonable to forecast that prices will continue to grow significantly in most of these cities for a year or two, even if the rate of growth continues to decline.
The psychological factors are more important for the long-term prognosis, beyond a year, when the upward movement no longer plays such an important role.
At this stage, prices are likely to show unstable drop, because enthusiasm for investing in stone will probably collapse at the same time as the decline in price growth.
The prices in glamorous cities will fall significantly in the next recession or when the economy will suffer it's next major impact or if interest rates rise too quickly.
Then the contagion within and across the markets will fall, making prices faill for years.
Water for all
This month, once more, water takes centre stage at the fourth World Water Forum in Mexico.
This is an opportune moment: While the attention of most of the world is focused on energy issues, supply and security, hundreds of millions of people in developing countries, still see the supply of fresh water as equally important, if not more.
The investigations conducted by the World Bank in developing countries show that, when you ask poor people to name the three most important challenges they face, "good health" is always part of this list.
And the key factor that determines whether they will remain healthy is  the access to clean water.
Today, in the world over a billion people do not have access.
So they are always easier prey to ill health.
The World Bank estimates that by 2035, nearly three billion people, almost all in developing countries, could live in conditions of very serious water shortages, especially if they live in Africa, the Middle East or South Asia.
This will cause obvious difficulties, but will also hinder the economic growth needed for millions of people to escape poverty.
In Latin America, nearly 15% of the population, so nearly 76 million people, has no access to drinking water, and 116 million people don't have access to health service.
The numbers are worse for Africa and certain parts of Asia.
This is a situation that few people have to face in rich countries.
Normally, the citizens of these countries benefit from public services that meet all their water needs, from drinking to irrigation and sanitation needs.
In addition, other issues related to water, such as the risks posed by floods, have been reduced to manageable levels.
The rich industrial countries invested very early and very heavily in infrastructure, institutions and water management.
The results, beyond the health benefits that it provides to all, have provided evidence of record economic growth: it is enough to examine the hydro-electric investments to understand the positive impact of projects for the management of water in many countries.
Of course, rich countries have some advantages: they enjoy generally temperate climates, where the rains are regular, and have usually little risk of drought or flood.
Even so, they are not immune to water-related disasters, as the destruction of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina has shown us.
But the impact of such events on poor countries is far more important.
The extreme variations of the rains, floods and droughts can have social and economic impact and result in loss of life on a large scale.
The coasts of the Gulf of Mexico and the Central American countries are constantly experiencing such tragedies, with the deprived communities being the most vulnerable and the least able to deal with these events.
The Ethiopia and Yemen are two comparable outstanding examples.
The development potential of the Ethiopia is so intimately linked to seasonal rains that huge variations in the rain, and the lack of infrastructure, has undermined the growth and perpetuated poverty.
A simple drought can reduce the potential for growth by 10% in the long term.
Yemen, meanwhile, has no permanent surface water and its citizens are entirely reliant on rainfall, groundwater and floods.
To move forward, developing countries need new infrastructures and better management of water.
All approaches must be designed in conjunction with the specific context of each country and the needs of their respective people, but there is no constraint linked with the investment in the use of water that ensures that local communities and the environment can obtain tangible benefits quickly.
In some countries, the implementation of new water infrastructures usually means the creation of canals, pumping stations and dams.
Other countries may need deeper reservoirs, more modern sewage treatment plants or improved water transportation systems.
All of that may be designed to improve and extend the water supply for energy generation, irrigation, and industrial and private use, while at the same time ensuring some degree of security against droughts and some protection against floods.
The key to the success of any expansion of investment in water infrastructure, is to proportionally increase investment in the institutions managing water.
If the infrastructure is poorly managed, it does not help to improve the health of populations or to support economic growth: the organisation of water and water management must work together.
The infrastructure can and should be developed in parallel with good, well-managed institutions related to the environment and with an equitable balance of costs and benefits.
A policy of investment in water that reduces the vulnerability of the poor and provides access to water for all requires a personalized management and a special partnership between the donor countries, developing country governments, the private sector and local communities.
Delegates of the World Water Forum will have multiple opportunities to build and strengthen these partnerships.
If successful, the benefits that poor people worldwide will draw will be immense.
Germany in a state of economic shock
Over the past ten years, Germany has experienced the slowest economic growth of the European Union, and Europe the slowest growth in the world.
From 1995 to 2005, German growth will not exceed 14.6%, whereas the old EU average was 24%, 39.9% in the United States, and the global economy was 45.6%.
What can explain such bad results in Germany?
According to Franz Müntefering, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party, the ruling party of Germany, it is simply because the country is already where others wish to be.
The slow growth in Germany, he maintained, is a sign of natural convergence.
This theory is far from convincing.
Germany has recently been surpassed in terms of per capita income by many EU countries including Ireland, the United Kingdom, Holland and France, and its growth remains slower than theirs.
Another theory, more plausible, is that over the last 15 years several external challenges, or shocks, have simultaneously rocked the country.
Trapped by its rigidity, its social system extended and a labour market highly regulated, Germany has been unable to react to these shocks and began to encounter problems.
This theory calls to mind a theory of the British historian Arnold Toynbee, which says that empires crumble because they are unable to respond to external challenges.
The first shock was the intensification of globalization, which provoked a massive surge of competition based on low wages.
Even if globalization is a progressive process, it gained energy when China has decided to enter the game.
China is ten times the size of Japan, and Japan had not been very easy to manage.
German precision instruments and optical equipment, for example, lost their competitiveness when Japan took the stage.
The second shock has been one of European integration, especially the expansion in the north and south.
The dismantling of the internal borders of the EU has all of a sudden extended the size of national markets and resulted in the planned economies of scale.
But this phenomenon has favoured small European countries more then large ones, and has meant more competition for Germany, the largest economy in Europe.
Take, Nokia, the mobile phone manufacturer .
Thanks to the economies of scale made possible by the common market, Nokia has been able to fully exploit their inventions, while Germany's Siemens had recently decided to drop the mobile phone market.
The third shock has been the euro. European currency has provoked a rapid convergence of long-term interest rates, which in certain countries have reached up to 5 to 7 percentage points more than in Germany.
Freed from exchange rate risks, international investors do not ask these countries for more risk premium and are happy to provide funds on favorable terms to all of them, which was formerly Germany's prerogative.
Europe only benefits from the situation, as the capital is now better distributed and growth stimulated with the migration of the German economy to the remote locations, which were previously disadvantaged in the euro zone.
However, the benefit is doubtful for German workers  who have also wanted to take advantage of this capital.
The fourth shock took the form of the enlargement to the east of the EU, which led to extraordinary opportunities for trade and investment, but also to a surge of low-priced labor.
In average, the wage levels in the 10 countries that joined the EU in 2004 represent only 14% of West Germany's.
The low wage competition has led to substantial outsourcing and offshore activities that have allowed German companies to remain competitive by reducing their demand for domestic labor.
Since neither the trade unions nor the German social system could accept pay cuts, the consequences have been rising unemployment and slow growth.
The fifth shock is the unification of Germany, a failure in economic terms.
The GDP per person of working age in eastern Germany was 61% of the level of West Germany in 1996, but it is waning today to 59%.
The slow growth of the eastern part of the country has brought down the German average, while the huge demand for public funds is only deepening the public debt.
The weakness of the fiscal position has in turn undermined investor confidence, with obvious impact on economic growth.
These five shocks are historic developments beneficial for the whole world, but problematic for Germany.
If the country wants to face challenges and continue to grow, it needs to relax its labour market.
Only if wages adjust downward to accommodate the new global environment that German workers will be competitive again, and the country will know a low unemployment rate again, by exploiting its human capital until capacity constraint.
The new government that voters will likely choose in September will be facing the difficult task of getting Germans to face reality and introducing necessary reforms.
Only then we will know if Germany is able to confront the Toynbee challenge that awaits it.
The lessons of the tsunami
Many lessons emerge from the tsunami, the cause of so much devastation and loss of human life in Asia.
This is a proof of globalization, while television showed the striking images of the destruction of homes in the whole world.
Indeed, it is in these times that the world really does seem to be a global village.
Of course, it seems that information on the scale of the disaster put more time to reach President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas.
But, finally, he decided to interrupt his vacation to offer some aid, the amount of which has been constantly revised upwards in an international competition which seemed likely to profit those who were waiting desperately to be helped.
American aid still appears to be shabby compared to the amount offered by countries that do have a fraction of American wealth.
Australia, which is sparsely populated, offered more than double American aid, Japan promised 50% more than America and Europe is committed to a sum five times greater.
This has helped many observers point out that the richest country in the world was the poorest in terms of international aid, especially when this sum is compared to what is being spent in defense and war.
This disaster is international, so it is also appropriate that the United Nations take the lead in coordinating the humanitarian effort.
Unfortunately, in an effort which was widely perceived as another attempt to undermine multilateralism, the United States tried to take over the leadership of a "central group" assistance program, ignoring ongoing efforts within the region under the aegis of the United Nations.
Whatever America's motive was, it judiciously decided afterwards to join the United Nations in its efforts.
The rhetoric used to save the face of the Bush administration claiming that they were developing a core group in the absence of any other effort has been slowly abandoned.
The response of some countries in the region was really impressive, showing the battle waged in the establishment of efficient and effective governments and staff.
Countless details were examined: Thailand sent ambassadors in the country's affected areas to help meet the needs of citizens, helped those who had lost everything, passport and goods, to return home, cared for the injured, set up systems for identifying bodies and dealt with the difficulties posed by the shortage of body bags and the lack of chilled areas to store bodies.
Countries who like Thailand realised that they could cope with the financial consequences themselves have asked for humanitarian aid to be sent to other countries.
They have asked for only one thing: the reduction of tariffs and better access to foreign markets.
They weren't asking for charity, just a chance to earn their own income.
They only received in response, at least at the time I am writing, an relentless silent .
Futhermore, the G7 has chosen to contribute significantly by offering to reduce the debt.
This is particularly important in the case of Indonesia, whose debt service now amounts to $132 billion, of which $70 billion is due to public creditors or is guaranteed by government agencies.
Even without the horrors of the tsunami, the burden of that debt would have represented a major obstacle in the development of this country, recovering as it was from the consequences of the 1997 financial crisis.
Indeed, the Indonesian debt relief is a convincing case as most of the debts were incurred in loans to the corrupt government of Suharto.
The leaders knew or should have known that part of the total of money lent would not be attributed to the development of Indonesia.
Moreover, part of the debt was incurred during the crisis of 1997-98, aggravated and extended by the policies imposed by the IMF.
No one pretends that it is possible to alter or prevent the forces of nature.
Instead, we must learn to manage them.
There is now talk of improved warning systems to prevent possible tsunamis.
We already have, however, received a warning on the issue of climate change.
Most countries recognize it and went to Rio and Kyoto to act together: even if it is insufficient, the Kyoto Protocol was designed as a good first step.
Unfortunately, global warming will probably destroy the same countries that have just been ravaged by the tsunami.
Islands which do not rise far above sea level, such as the Maldives, will be submerged.
We are not a global village yet .
After contesting the scientific evidence highlighting the problems, the biggest polluter of the planet, the United States, has simply refused to act beyond mere appeal to a certain voluntary restriction that we see little achievement in America in any case.
The international community must still consider the treatment to apply to this aberrant member who refuses to take his responsibilities as a global citizen.
The optimists will say that technology can solve these problems.
Realists will note that in the long-distance race between technology and the environment, it seems that as of our day technology is the loser.
Nature, as shown by the tsunami, possesses its own clock.
As long as we haven't learned to respect it, we will all miss the train.
The accuracy of experts
Every day, experts bombard us with their views on subjects as varied as Iraqi insurgents, Bolivia's coca growers, central european bankers and the Politburo of North Korea. 
Up until what point are these experts credible?
An optimistic view is that as long as those who sell expertise compete vigorously for the attention of shrewd buyers (the media), market mechanisms will ensure quality control.
The experts published in the pages of newspapers, or who appear on the television and the radio, must surely have a good reputation, because otherwise they would have been eliminated.
Skeptics, however, warn that the media impose on us their choice of speakers and they are less interested in reasoned debate than in catering to popular prejudices.
Accordingly, celebrity may well be linked negatively, and not positively, to long-term accuracy.
Until recently, nobody knew who was right because nobody kept track of the results of these experts.
But a research over the last 20 years ago suggests today that sceptics are the closest to the truth.
I describe this project in detail in my book Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How Can We Know?
[the political judgment of experts: What is it worth?
How do we know? The original idea was to ask for thousands of predictions from hundreds of experts about the fates of dozens of countries, and note those predictions according to their accuracy.
We have discovered that media does not eliminate the bad ideas, but often reinforces them, especially when the truth is too complex to be presented clearly.
The evidence fall into two categories.
First, as have warned the sceptics, when hordes of experts are fighting for the limelight, many are tempted to claim that they know more than in reality.
Experts who forecast the worst and the best are those who tend to exaggerate.
Between 1985 and 2005, experts the most optimistic forecasts over 10 years ago which frontlines the chances of major changes on both the financial markets (e.g. a Dow Jones to 36,000) and in terms of global politics (for example the calm in the Middle East and dynamic growth in sub-Saharan Africa).
They gave a likelihood of 65% to optimistic scenarios that materialised in just 15% of cases.
During the same period of time, the most pessimistic experts were even more misguided, exaggerating the risks of adverse changes in the very place where over optimistic experts were overfllowing whit good news, and by adding many other's (still, I await the imminent disintegration of Canada, Nigeria, India, Indonesia, South Africa, Belgium and Sudan).
They gave the likelihood of 70% to disaster scenarios which were realized in only 12% of the cases.
In addition, as had once again been predicted the sceptics, experts claim to know more than they actually pay rarely their mistakes.
Indeed, the media pay much attention to them while neglecting their humbler colleagues.
On can see this process particularly highlighted when, in following the philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin, we categorize the experts as "hedgehogs" and "foxes".
The hedgehogs are those who have great ideas and become infatuated with grand theories: libertarians ideas, Marxism, environmentalism, etc.
Their self-confidence can be contaigeous
They know how to maintain the momentum of a discussion by increasing the number of reasons showing that they are right and that the others are wrong.
This is what earns them the approval of the media.
But they do not know when to press on their mental brake by making concessions to other points of view.
They take their theories too seriously.
Result: the hedgehogs commit more mistakes, but they accumulate more success on Google.
The eclectic foxes are better off calming their ideological enthusiasm.
They feel more comfortable in the face of prolonged uncertainty about who is right even within the framework of bitter debates, admit their shortcomings and accord legitimacy to opposing points of view.
They punctuate their conversations with qualifiers which limit the scope of their arguments: "but", "however", and "even though".
As they scurry of oversimplifying,  foxes make fewer mistakes.
To put it simply, the foxes are often in agreement with the hedgehogs up to a point: "Yes, my colleague was right when he said that the Saudi monarchy is vulnerable, but remember that coups d'etats are rare and the government has many ways to crush the opposition."
Imagine that your job in the media depends on your ability to expand your audience.
Who would you pick: an expert who balances conflicting arguments and concludes that the most likely result is that nothing will change, or an expert who gets the public spellbound with stories of islamic radicts taking control and provoking a rise in the prices of oil?
In short, the qualities that make foxes more inclined to accuracy also make them less popular.
At this point, uncharitable skeptics chuckle that we have the media that we deserve.
But this is not fair.
No society has yet created a reliable method for evaluating the results of experts.
Even those citizens who value accuracy have little way of knowing they are sacrificing it when they change the channel to switch from boring foxes to charismatic hedgehogs.
It is there that between stage a modest proposal which applies to all the democracies: the market of ideas works better if it is easier for citizens to see the exchanges between accuracy and entertainment, or between the accuracy and loyalty to a party.
Don't they read more the reports of experts who have most often been right?
In this case, the experts could become more reliable showing more humility, and the political debate begin to be less strident.
Agreed, it is not easy to create ways to assess who was right and that would cover the full spectrum of reasonable opinions.
But in a world where, as Yeats said, "the worst are filled with passionate intensity and the best have a lack of conviction," it is worth trying.
What is Europe's future?
In many ways, 2005 represents the annus horibilis of Europe.
It started well, with the approval of the proposed constitutional treaty by the Spanish voters, but it turned to vinegar when the French and Dutch voters rejected it shortly after.
These votes reflected in part the displeasure of voters to the domestic policies as well as their disappointment regarding the governmental conduct of European affairs.
Governments are then hurriedly sent to offer more of these unsatisfactory cases.
In the days after those elections, they failed to agree on the European Union's budget for the period from 2007 to 2013.
The French and British leaders have engaged in a dispute that has wrecked the following summit, just before Britain takes the presidency in July.
Generally, the countries involved are using the European Union presidency to show their ability to solve problems and move the European Union forward.
But, since early December, Britain slumbers.
Besides burying the proposed constitutional treaty, it largely abandoned the issue of the budget.
There is very unlikely that she will succeed in getting the budget this year, and, unless the dispute is quickly resolved, the European Union will have no operating budget for 2007.
Even if the budget is finally adopted, the Austrian presidency, which begins on January 1st, will not be lacking for depressing situations.
The biggest problem remains the European inability to accelerate its growth pace and to offer jobs to its citizens.
This is mainly due to the big three, France, Germany and Italy, who produces 70% of European GDP.
The collective response, adopted in 2000, was the "Lisbon strategy," which aims to make the European Union "the most dynamic economy and the most competitive in terms of knowledge in the world" in 2010.
More realistically, it is designed to offer governments the necessary incentives to establish reforms to deal with everything that is slowing down economic growth and productivity.
That means facing a myriad of interest groups, from industrial lobbies to unions and entrenched bureaucracies that have, (so far) managed to protect their area.
The strategy is based on peer pressure and consists of pointing out governments who are not making progress in order to shame them.
In fact, however, peer pressure has turned into collusion of peers.
When European Union leaders met in the spring to assess their progress, they sadly admitted that the objectives of the Lisbon strategy had little chance to be achieved.
They could, at best, now, stop pretending to cling to this strategy and continue their progress in other areas.
Unfortunately, José Manuel Barroso, who presided over the summit in 2000, when he was prime minister of Portugal and the active chairman of the European Commission, had put his presidency at stake with the Lisbon strategy.
We should expect to see him defend her desperately.
One of the few good ideas of the Lisbon strategy was to remove the customs barriers for the exchange of services.
Competition in services in Europe is restricted by innumerable national regulations which, for example, strictly regulate professions, such as hairdressing and plumbing.
One of the key features of recent decades has been the significant increase in productivity in the services field in the U.S., but this has absolutely not happened in Europe.
Guess why.
Because the services account for 70% of the european GDP and the potential impact of increased competition is important.
However, it is always difficult, politically, to remove the protections.
The European Commission has made a proposal in 2005, even as the Constitution was subject to voting.
It is hardly surprising that this proposal was quickly abandoned.
Today, since a large number of private interest groups are trying to dilute it until removing all its meaning, this battle is assuredly registered on the agenda of the European Union for 2006.
Europe also blocks progress of the Doha cycle in international trade negotiations, due to the farming lobby that fights to preserve its subsidies.
Many are the governments which fear their farmers to the point of not having any other choice but to not give in, whatever the circumstances.
Europe has accepted the idea of a trade policy.
When the disagreements are as profound as they are in the case of agriculture, there is no latitude for conducting successful negotiations.
There is little reason to remain optimistic.
And what will the future be for ECB, which had to adjust its key interest rates by 0.25% after 30 months of waiting.
Experts may not agree on the relevance of this decision, but no one agrees with the many political leaders who argue that this small increase will derail the slight recovery in economic growth.
The acidity of political attacks against the ECB could trigger dangerous debates on the restriction of its independence.
Even if it is out of the question that this will happen, because it would necessitate amending the Treaty, all this brouhaha is not healthy.
It diverts the ECB from its objectives and inflates the notion that Europe is a bad thing, and, above all, that will be used as a scapegoat by failing governments to explain away their failures.
We can expect other anti-bce reactions.
Is Europe in a rut?
The current team of leaders has been a great disappointment.
We nevertheless have a chance to see the light at the end of the tunnel with their gradual replacement.
In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel, seems more positive on the issue of Europe and more focused on reforms than her predecessor, but her hands are tied by the grand coalition that supports her.
In France, President Jacques Chirac, image by excellence of the leader hostage to its pressure groups, swaying in a helpless way towards the end of his mandate, expected in 2007.
The two frontrunners to replace him, Dominique de Villepin and Nicolas Sarkozy, both members of the government, are clashing as to their agendas for reform, but the years before an election do not encourage radical changes.
Italy, will have to decide if it wants to replace Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who shows no interest for reforms and European affairs, by Romano Prodi, a cautious man and former European Commission president.
Tony Blair, once a staunch defender of Europe (at least according to the low standards of Britain), may well have to give the power to Gordon Brown, who is known for its lack of warmth towards European integration.
Fortunately, Britain has always been an outsider.
Finally, whatever the light at the end of the tunnel, it may not shine before 2007, after the elections in France.
Tame politicians on both sides of the Atlantic
Despite the occasional murmuring of politicians, no one seriously doubts the independence of the European Central Bank, nor the fact that monetary policy in the eurozone is therefore well protected against political pressures.
But the recent death of the Stability and Growth Pact, killed by Germany, its father, with France playing the role of co-conspirator and complacent accomplice, reminds us of a much-needed lesson: elected politicians find it difficult, if not impossible, to give up their immense power in the area of fiscal policy.
This situation applies on both sides of the Atlantic.
The  American Federal Reserve is obviously very independent.
But any attempt aimed at limiting the American federal government's fiscal discretion in the way the Stability Pact does (as, for example, the notorious Gramm-Rudman Act of the Clinton era) always collapses in the end under pressure from the President and the Congress.
In the years of election, monetary policy can be used to stimulate, if not more, an economy, just as tax policy, and therein lies the objective of politicians.
But the ill-considered use of one of these two mechanisms to achieve short-term objectives could create long-term costs, justifying some restrictions imposed on the latitude politicians have in influencing  macroeconomic policies.
When politicians can control inflation with a decisive influence on the central banks, they can use their power to devalue the burden of public debt, thus avoiding the need for extra tax to repay that debt.
This was the great lesson of the 1970s and early 1980s, when runaway inflation forced politicians to give up this power for the benefit of independent central banks, who alone could convince the markets that price stability would be restored.
The monetary policy, however, is not a unique mode of economic policy making.
The aspects of fiscal policy could also be delegated to independent bureaucrats in order to keep politicians on the ranks.
Why not, for example, give an independent bureaucracy a few redistribution goals or control over the level of public investment and the management of deficits?
An independent tax authority could doubtless apply the long-term goals of a society in these areas better than politicians, who have their eyes fixed on the next elections.
Indeed, in principle, it is impossible to understand why the monetary and fiscal policy should be considered so different, one being fully delegated to an agency bureaucrat and the other being completely unregulated, left in the hands of politicians.
So why does this vast difference really exist, as much in America as in Europe?
Because the tax policy is the major tool used by politicians to attract and retain the support of a coalition to win voters made up of pensioners, officials and middle class property owners, while imposing costs on the losing coalition.
It is not necessary to satisfy 100% of the voters, but just a sufficient number to win the victory.
The map of tax plays a critical role in the choice of groups of voters to buy.
The independent tax authorities (or tax rules such as the stability pact) hinder this political use of fiscal policy, which is expensive.
After all, if politicians cannot win elections by taking money from some voters (including future generations, which must bear some of the cost) to give it to others, they must work much harder to show some ability to produce public benefits for all.
It is a much more difficult task!
Of course, the policy also includes the effects of redistribution.
Think of the various effects of interest rates on debtors versus creditors.
The monetary policy is however a much more awkward, indirect and imprecise way of choosing fiscal policy winners and losers .
Independent central banks can sometimes be a nuisance for politicians, but at least, they can be used as scapegoats when necessary, a role whose political benefits outweigh the costs of the loss of control over a useful tool.
These considerations should guide the choice of the system to replace the stability pact in Europe.
It is now quite clear that national governments, particularly those of major countries, will never accept significant limits on their fiscal discretion.
They may have suspended their freedom of maneuver tax long enough to allow the launch of the Euro, but in normal conditions, national governments will reclaim their land tax.
The European Commission must stop fighting a rearguard battle which only serves to undermine its credibility, especially in the eyes of the small nations, which are the only ones on which it is possible to exert pressure so that they will accept unwanted tax regulations.
Realistically, the commission can only make requests to national governments to ensure that their tax accounts are transparent and clear.
It is impossible to prevent the political use of tax policy.
But at least the fiscal measures of a country should not be hidden in obscure footnotes at the bottom of the page in their budgets.
Even this limited target can be hard to achieve.
A lack of strategic openness is in the interests of astute politicians who want to settle a lobby group while covering the costs of public largesse to the majority of citizens.
The rules which govern the behavior of politicians should not be written as if unbiased and well-intentioned civil servants were going to be applying them.
Politicians are ready to go to a lot of trouble to satisfy their supporters and win the elections.
We can at best hope to ensure that the worst acts they commit are done openly.
Will the European Union uphold its promises to Turkey?
More than 40 years ago, Turkey has applied to become an associate member of the European Economic Community.
The association agreement in 1963 has created a special relationship, crowned by the customs union in 1996.
For all these years, European governments have been reaffirming that Turkey could become a member state, provided it abides by the membership criteria.
The formal recognition of its candidacy in 1999 urged Turkey to undertake an unprecedented package of reforms in the area of human rights and the rights of minorities, notably the abolition of capital punishment, the adoption of guarantees against torture, the promotion of religious freedom and equality between the sexes and the restriction of the role of the Army in political life.
If the European Union considers that the membership criteria have been met, it must start negotiations at the beginning of 2005.
The EU would otherwise be breaking its political commitments and would seriously undermine it's credibility in the world.
However, all over Europe this accession is viewed with skepticism, because of the size of Turkey and because of its economic situation, because of a fear of massive immigration and above all because of "cultural and social differences," a euphemism referring to Islam.
We cannot deny that some of these factors are huge challenges.
But they are often exaggerated and certainly not insurmountable.
The negotiations with Turkey would be long and membership might not happen before 2015.
This time would allow Turkey as well as the Union to prepare.
With 80 million inhabitants, Turkey would become one of the largest member states of the European Union.
But the role of a country's size is limited in the decision-making process of the EU, where political influence depends more on economic power.
In addition, Turkey has for several decades been a responsible member of many European institutions, and there is no reason to think it would behave differently in the Union.
Because of the weakness of its economy, Turkey could lay claim to significant amounts of aid.
But these transfers would depend on the EU monetary policy at the time of membership, the outcome of negotiations and development of the Turkish economic situation.
In any case, putting a "ceiling" on the budget as practiced by the EU would avoid an explosion of the financial cost of Turkey's accession.
Immigration should not cause either pointless concern.
Human mobility is limited, and Turkish workers would probably not have the right to move freely within the European Union until after a long period of transition, perhaps not before 2025.
Given the strong growth expected in the Turkish economy and the decrease in birth rates, experts estimate there would then be around 2.7 million immigrants.
Meanwhile, shrinking and aging population in the bulk of Europe have made immigration a necessity.
But among the most probable countries of origin  of the migrants, Turkey offers the best chances of successful adaptation.
It is the Muslim population of Turkey who raises the most feelings.
Many have the feeling that Turkey has no place in a European company based on a culture and Christian traditions.
It also feared that Islamists make a fundamentalist state out of Turkey someday.
As improbable as it may seem, since secularism is strongly rooted in Turkey, this risk cannot be totally ruled out.
But it exists in any democracy, where extremist groups could divert the democratic process to achieve their aims.
The best way to avoid such a disaster is undoubtedly to strengthen the democratic system, and, in order to do that, to anchor Turkey firmly within a bloc of countries that are also democratic.
As to the European Union, it must decide whether it wants to be a "Christian club" closed, or on the contrary an open society, strengthened and enriched by its cultural and religious diversity.
Turkey's accession would make a strong response, with particular resonance in the Muslim world.
The need to challenge the arguments against Turkey's accession means that its benefits are rarely mentioned: a unique geopolitical location at the crossroads of the Balkans, South Caucasus, Central Asia and Middle East -regions of vital importance for the security of Europe-; a major transit country for energy supplies; military capacity at a time when the EU is developing its new European defence policy; and a strong economic potential, with a young and dynamic workforce.
At the same time, one must take into account the risk of rejecting Turkey: the probability of the failure of the reform process, which would encourage the extremist movements and cause instability and political turmoil at the gates of the EU.
Turkey's entry into the European Union opens up broad prospects and  also comes with challenges to overcome.
But the prospects are far superior.
The game of the democracy.
In Calcutta, where a younger boy went and insisted on participating in the game that my friends were playing, we let him come, but only after whispered in the ear of the other words
When we were children, it was important to master the cruel art of
The technique of the
That which applies to children and adults also applies to international institutions.
Indeed, the organizations which have officially committed to involving all of the nations in their decision making are often controlled by small groups of powerful nations, while others will only make a semblance of participation.
The World Trade Organization (WTO), supposedly founded on the principle of one country one vote, in reality has its agenda programmed in the wings by a small group of nations.
It is now common for international organizations which publish a report implicate all "stakeholders" and reflect their views.
The evolutive report is generally presented on a website and all without exception (NGOs, unions and other civil society organisations) are invited to make suggestions.
This step promotes a sense of participation, but, as a friend who is well-versed in these matters taught me, the secret is to finally ignore all the comments received and write the report as if there were no website and as if no participation had been noted.
Increasingly, free expression of opinion does not influence or control the government's behaviour.
Consider the U.S.
The Americans have expressed their opinion freely, in the newspapers, on television, in discussion forums on the Internet, about the Iraq war planned by George Bush.
Never before had there been so much opposition to a war
What happened, or rather what didn't happen, is admirable: almost no effort was undertaken to muzzle the government critics, as was the case in China and in several dictatorial countries.
But the major democracies of the world, the United States, India, the UK, etc., are becoming more and more adept at banning freely expressed opinions aimed at restricting government actions.
The war taking place in Iraq is probably the best evidence.
Let's leave aside the immorality of war, and God knows how immoral it is ! I want to draw attention on this growing ability and on the trend of democracies to "treat" with (to neutralize) public opinion.
They have adopted the strategy of
When the democracies ripen, they become more than ever expert in the management of the opinion, and in most cases in shaping public opinion.
After every comment Hans Blix made about the UN inspections he ran in Iraq, members of the Bush administration paraphrased what Blix was saying.
This paraphrase subtly modified Blix's comments in order to support America's arguments in favour of war.
By repeating the distorted comments, the Bush administration hoped that public opinion would be swayed toward the war.
It can be difficult to overturn a totalitarian regime and hold elections, but the hardest job is to turn the votes of voters into a real democracy.
For those accustomed to living in a totalitarian state, it is not easy to learn the meaning of the word "participation".
Hence the popular belief that democracies, like wine, improve with age.
Although that may be true, maturity has its own inconveniences.
While the citizens of a democracy are continually learn to participate, democratic governments learn constantly to reach their goals despite the participation.
There is no use in denying that civic participation too often serves only to legitimize shams.
We must recognize and address this problem in order to prevent the atrophy of established democracies  and to help new democracies to become more efficient.
Because it is not only morally wrong to allow nations and communities feel marginalized and without a voice; it is the best way to frustration, rage and terrorism.
The redistribution of governance in Asia
The government (the way decisions that affect public interest are taken) became a key factor in determining the pace of development of a country. A successful governance leads to solved changes.
Failures are punished by malaise, discontent and stagnation.
On April 18th a conference will be held in Bangkok to discuss the prospects for improving governance in Asia.
Today's Asian policymakers have to confront a very different environment from that of their predecessors fifty years earlier.
The Asiatic population has more than doubled since 1950, mainly in the poorest countries.
The political system in these countries was adapted for small, stable and rural populations.
Today, these societies (or companies) must administer extended  urban centers as well as talents and multiple requests from the urban populations.
The world economy has also changed dramatically.
The increase the flow of goods, capital and expertise in the world means that foreign organisations and individuals have greater influence, further complicating the task of national governments concerned by the internal management of their own nations.
Thus, the international institutions such as the WTO have changed the terms of reference from which economic decisions are taken.
The changes coming in local economies are equally radical.
In some parts of Asia, living standards have soared.
Region-specific foreign investments even external altered the structure of domestic economies.
The old models of economic growth, however, such as the encouragement of exports and the selective use of import restrictions, which have been producing good results in Eastern Asia in the last century, are less well adapted to the new international exchange laws.
So we have to create new rules of the game.
In most Asian countries, the official rules must be simplified and applied more fairly.
A "return to the sources" approach is essential in three related areas in which the national governments must take control: reducing corruption, strengthening property rights and the consistent application of legal principles.
Few countries can score points in these areas.
The close links between business and governments have been accused of being responsible for the financial crises that have hit Southeast Asia in 1997.
In some regions of South Asia, violent conflicts and the power of interests in place have jeopardized the legal principles.
The result of such failures is that the elites flourish while the masses suffer.
A clear structure of formal rules remains the best antidote to these failures because they reinforce the informal customs on which so many societies are based.
Business is not conducted in court but in the meetings where the confidence and reputation are essential elements.
As pointed out by Robert Putnam, the social theorist, "social capital" (the networks, standards and social trust which facilitate cooperation and coordination for the benefit of all) is as much a factor as a result of economic growth.
Giving power to as many members of the civil society as possible more surely tends to instill specific goals into the efforts deployed to help nations advance.
The government, the private sector and civil society all have a role in strengthening the social capital.
But some successful interactions between these sectors  cannot simply be desired without any input and it is essential for everyone's role to be clearly defined.
Many Asian governments recognize the need to redefine their role more clearly.
Following the crisis of 1997, governments have stepped back a little from the markets, recognizing the limits of their ability to act, and the importance of allowing private entrepreneurship to develop.
However, governments have a role to play in encouraging a supportive environment in which the markets can operate.
The regulation of control and application are two important but different ways of working (let's say through mixed partnerships between private and public sectors) that are increasingly used in many innovative Asian economies.
The valuable role of civil society in the expression of community opinion, that governments cannot attain, has also been recognised, but its relationship to the government and to the business world is more often characterized by conflict than cooperation.
The role of the private sector in the decision-making must also often be clearer: where companies are too influential in relation to governments, their needs to operate in a profitable manner can lead to policies promoting the elites rather than the masses.
The metaphor of the game (with its rules and its participants) leads some to think in terms of international competition.
It is not very good since our interdependent world is not a zero-sum game, where the gains of a nation represent the losses of another.
In fact, nations are not engaged in a competition between each other as is the case for companies.
Commercial trade is a positive sum game where all the countries benefit from the exploitation of their areas of comparable advantage.
A good governance can improve this positive sum game and ensure that businesses and individuals in these countries participate in profits.
It can be the right thing to consider governments as entities, competing with each other ( to offer a better service to their people than other governments).
Which confers an important role upon the international comparisons of systems
In this spirit, the conference of the UNCTAD-UNDP this month ("Governance in Asia: Underpinning Competitiveness in a Global Economy"), will bring together policymakers across Asia to discuss challenges facing the Asian governments.
The role of government (the only player to have the legitimacy of a popular mandate) is fundamentally important in the direction of a nation going forward.
The private sector and civil society are, of course, more and more often important partners for governments.
The operation of the relations between these participants will influence deeply the future of the development in Asia.
The 18 Brumaire of Arnold Schwarzenegger
Replacing a governor that they had reelected scarcely a year earlier with Arnold Schwarzenegger should have brought Californian voters a great pleasure, though tinged with guilt.
Some members of the opposition in Germany would love to do the same with Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, although they have not (yet!
) found the movie star to replace him.
Several other European governments have also experienced a certain lack of popularity shortly after their election.
This situation is also true in non-European countries, as with, for example, the recently acclaimed Brazilian President Luis Inacio "Lula" da Silva, not to mention South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun, the latter having called for a referendum to halt the decline in his popularity.
It seems that today, the effects of electoral success quickly subside.
Should each country therefore adopt a recall procedure to preserve the legitimacy of governments?
Absolutely not.
Democracy, to borrow the terms of the philosopher Karl Popper, is defined by the ability to remove those in power without violence; it is then, according to this definition, a method of trial and error.
But the leaders must have the chance to govern.
Indeed, they must have a chance to make mistakes, so long as their decisions do not affect the very foundations of the democratic order.
The method by trials and errors entails the possibility of being wrong before trying again.
The first error of California voters involves "the lure of immediacy," which is hardly surprising in a state where instant gratification is considered a value in itself.
But this desire sometimes seems damning in post-modern democracies throughout the world.
Indeed, democracy today has adopted a pop culture of fads which disappear as quickly as they appeared; today's pop group with its hysterical fans will be forgotten tomorrow and there are many others waiting in the wings.
In politics, this situation can prove to be dangerous because it encourages quick decisions, whatever their importance, according to the popular opinion that prevails at the time.
The call to an increasing number of referendums reflects and enlivens this trend.
Referendums are, for the most part, snapshots.
Switzerland, with its usually slower pace and its in-depth political debates before the elections, is probably the only exception to this rule.
In general, the referendums are used to measure the popularity of political leaders at a given time, whatever the problem at stake.
If and when Britain decides upon the adoption of the Euro, it is more likely that the outcome of this vote will teach us all sorts of things about Tony Blair and the European Union, but very little about the merits of the common currency.
Thus, the arguments in favour of a representative government remain not negligible.
Democracy is governing by organizing debates, making important decisions after in-depth deliberations which, at least in the major countries, must be conducted in a parliament by elected representatives.
Parliaments sometimes act quickly, and perhaps they are obliged to do so, but in general, they take enough time to examine issues in detail.
The parliaments speak before forming conclusions, hence their name.
Let's take the case of Germany, a country in which some leaders of the opposition Christian Democrats group burn with the desire to reduce the Schröder government to nothing.
Evidently, the proposed reforms that have already been enacted by the government are unpopular and there is little doubt that a year after its re-election, the coalition of Social Democrats and Greens has very little chance to convince at the ballot boxes.
But who can know what voters will think in three years, when the government's term ends?
In the next election, voters, with hindsight, could realize that there was no real alternative to the policies of Schroeder and it could even be that the beneficial effects expected from these painful reforms become apparent before then.
The leaders need time to make and enforce unpopular as popular decisions.
They need courage to lead often precarious parliamentary majorities on the road to popularity which has its ups and downs.
This is why they are forced to take the most painful measures during the first year of their term, only to tone things down when the next election approaches.
The precarious partnership of Prime Minister Tony Blair and Finance Minister Gordon Brown illustrates this kind of tactics perfectly.
Leaders who never risk their popularity are not worthy of their position.
California has thus shown a bad example and Californians will probably pay a high price for their mistake.
It will however probably not be as high as the one paid by France one century and a half ago, when Louis Napoleon, elected by universal suffrage, became, through a excessively popular referendum, Napoleon III, this vote being the last one in France until the end of the Second Empire.
The Californians, of course, will not be denied the right to vote, but their obstinacy may generate an unpredictable and irresponsible form of state policymaking.
It is certain that democracy means a limited period of time during which the world's powers must be able to exercise their power unchallenged.
For a democracy to be efficacious, it must allow enough time for its  elected representatives to take office, to legislate and to implement their program.
These two imperatives are by nature contradictory, but a representative parliamentary democracy is still the best way to ensure balance between the two.
Any other regime would be as stable as the ten best pop songs this week.
Herbert Hoover and the stability pact
In mid-July, the high and mighty finance ministers of the member states of the European Monetary Union (EMU) met to discuss the economic situation in the Eurozone.
They have ruminated about the most recent economic forecasts, which project an annual growth of GDP in the Eurozone this year at the woefully anemic level of 0.7%.
Then, except for a single minister, they all decided that their economy should suffer a little from this scandal or even worse.
They have reaffirmed their commitment to the Growth and Stability Pact, which requires the Eurozone countries to raise taxes and lower public spending, increasing the pressure on their economies.
The pact is already pushing Germany into recession, the Italian government is struggling to revise its growth forecasts quickly enough not to be overtaken by a failing index of production.
Yet, this does not seem like enough to force officials to review their priorities.
Some European finance ministers still consider the stability pact as the "cornerstone" of the EMU.
Others speak of the importance of obeying the "rule of the game".
Others believe that recovery must be done "in the spirit of the pact," even if it remains essential to restore economic growth.
Seen from the other side of the Atlantic, all these reasons seem very strange.
The last time that the American government tried to ensure a balanced budget despite the recession was 70 years ago, under Herbert Hoover's presidency at the beginning of the Great Depression.
Since a broad consensus is established in the United States on the cycles of economic depression which require the use of the budget deficits to relieve the sufferings, to stimulate the general request and to precipitate the recovery.
Economists call these cyclical tax surges, "automatic stabilisers."
When household incomes fall, so does the income of the public sector.
Income tax reductions can increase disposable income.
But, principally, when household incomes are falling, the social costs of the government are increasing, triggering the recovery of demand, production, investment and employment.
The lower income taxes and higher costs, expand the budget deficit, but in a healthy and effective way.
On the american side of the Atlantic, the usefulness of these fiscal stabilizers is not in doubt.
Instead, with every recession threat, the political debate revolves around their strengthening by impetus
No more than it is a matter of fiscal discipline.
Every time that proposals to amend the Constitution in order to balance the budget have surfaced, the proposals have always offered exceptions not only in case of war but also in case of recession.
We understand the origins of the stability pact and growth.
Northern European countries, particularly Germany and Holland, are always keen to maintain a loose relationship between their debt and GDP and relatively low interest rates.
When these countries have noticed that the southern European countries, Italy and Greece especially, used to had a high ratio between their debt and their GDP and high enough nominal interest rates due to their visible tolerance against inflation.
The countries of Northern Europe feared that the deficits of the South might finally create a pressure for partial monetarization of their debt through inflation of the Euro; or more precisely, their leaders feared that investors who were fearful for the same reasons would demand higher interest rates.
The growth and stability pact was intended to maintain the debt of southern European countries at low levels, and now interest rates (are) low enough to reassure investors about the fact that national debt would never be allowed to rise to the point of generating inflationary pressure.
However, if one examines the economic problems of the Euro zone today, the threat of nominally elevated interest rates over the long term is certainly not part of the ten major concerns among investors.
At worst, investors do not fear that a high debt leads governments to slow inflation by printing banknotes.
The problems of the European Union are due to a stagnant production index, increased structural unemployment, a weak increase in productivity growth, a useless and unfair common agricultural policy and the forecast of structural adjustments in view of the expansion of the European Union itself.
In a certain point of view, it is right that the euro zone finance ministers are ready to maintain a lower national debt on the long-term: this is a sign that the victories over inflation won in the 1970s will purely and simply not be ignored.
But it is dangerous to be obsessed by the past.
There is no safer way to economic disaster than historial blindness.
As demonstrated by Herbert Hoover, when one only considers the economic problems of the previous generation, one risks not seeing the dangers that are right before our eyes.
The ghosts of our economy past
In the famous novel, "A Christmas Carol," by Charles Dickens,  Ebeneezer Scrooge, a businessman without a soul, was harassed by the spirit of Christmas past.
Today, economists are similarly disturbed by undesirable ghost when they think about the resurgence of economic woes that were believed dead and buried a long time.
Whether it's Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley or Paul Krugman of Princeton, the Board of Governors of the American Federal Reserve or whoever it might be in Japan, economists the world over are concerned about deflation.
Their concerns date back to the economic thinking of fifty years ago, when economists had discovered that the only thing to do against deflation was to avoid it like the plague!
In 1933, Irving Fisher -- Milton Friedman's predecessor as the head of the American monetary school -- announced that governments should prevent large depressions by avoiding deflation.
Deflation -- the steady and continuing deterioration of the prices -- urged the world of business and consumers to reduce their spending and hoarding their cash.
This reduces the ability of shops and banks to repay their debts and can trigger a number of enormous bankruptcies destroying confidence in the financial system, which then fuels fear and hoarding.
Such incentives for hoarding rather than for spending maintain demand at its lowest and still falling level, while unemployment develops and grows over such a long period of time that even politicians and economists who ardently argue against laissez-faire policies cannot accept it.
Thus, is that the solution: use the Keynesian monetary policies (lower interest rates) and tax (inflation of public spending and tax reduction) to keep the economy away from the Gulf which makes deflation possible.
But if this issue was settled more than 50 years ago, why does it come back to haunt us?
Why does this represent a threat that worries Japan so much today and should we be worried in the United States?
At the end of the 1940s, those who presided over the creation of a post-war international economic order tried to create an international monetary system which (a) permitted sufficient stabilization of exchange rates so that producers and consumers could avoid the dangers of excessive and irrational fluctuations in exchange rates, (b) allowed nations to establish their own macroeconomic policies and (c) anticipated catastrophic panics which affect not only banks and private individuals, but also entire nations and which caused the destructive international financial crisis called the Great Depression.
This results in the creation of the system Bretton-Wood, where the exchange rates are fixed and variable, which became over the years the floating system of the 1980's.
Then came the 90s.
Suddenly, the incredibly destructive financial crises reappeared following public panic in Mexico, Thailand, Korea, Brazil, etc., and resembled the American financial panic of 1873 or the Austrian Creditanstalt crisis in 1931.
The Argentine crisis at the end of the year 2001 bore a truly striking resemblance to the Argentine crisis of Baring Brothers, in 1890 – except for the fact that the politicians and international bankers seemed to have a much better idea of what had to be done to minimize the damage than they appear to have today.
So, if those who built the international monetary system of post-war worked to put in place safeguards to protect us from the dangers of international financial crisis created by the popular panics, why is this kind of crisis being reborn today?
The truth is that economic policies are juggling a whole series of possible disasters, tossing from one hand to another the one that seems to be the most threatening and the one that seems to be the most remote.
In the United States, the Bush administration remains skeptical about the ability of monetary policies to stimulate and wants to maintain large budget deficits to reduce unemployment, hoping that the future dangers posed by persistent deficits -- reduced investments, sluggish growth, loss of confidence, uncontrollable inflation and depreciation in exchange rates -- can be skillfully manipulated or will not become evident until after the Bush team's departure from the presidency.
In Europe, the European Central Bank believes that the danger of uncontrolled inflation, following a loss of public confidence in its commitment to low inflation, outweighs the costs of a still too high unemployment.
In developing countries, the control of capital in order to prevent financial crises is perceived as an obstacle to the attraction of the capital needed for industrialization, and as a potential source of corruption since the financial flow passes in one way or another through the hands of the nephew by marriage of the Deputy Minister of Finance.
Flexible exchange rates designed to allow markets to indicate the loss of confidence in the currency put exporters in a competitive and difficult situation compared to the producers of foreign countries whose prices are manipulated by unpredictable exchange rates.
Even the policies of import substitution, much criticized today, were originally adopted by developing countries for good (and bad) reasons: the protectionist closing of the markets in the developed countries during the Great Depression had disastrous consequences for the economies of the developing countries.
The ghosts of our past economy come back because the present lessons are still overwhelmed.
Politicians and people who decide show up their economic approach as "the one and only doctrine."
But what they do, in fact, is to manage the most important issues of the moment at the expense of the disappearance of institutions and policies put in place by their predecessors to control the problems that they received as the most urgent.
Ebenezer Scrooge's nocturnal visitors were able to convince him that he was wrong and to open his eyes to his mistakes.
Lets hope that today's economists will also learn from their undesirable ghosts.
In the shadow of the D-mark
Overcoming the Irish cocktail.
Justification for humanitarian intervention
I visited the former Soviet republics of Central Asia in 1998 to take part in talks on democratic development, which took place (or should have taken place) in these newly independent countries.
My hosts were former communist leaders who now assumed the role of more or less democratically elected presidents.
Each of them spoke without constraints of institutions, democratic procedures and respect for the law.
But human rights were a different matter entirely.
I have presented in each country a list of political prisoners, asking what was their fate.
In only one country, the president has immediately decided to release a man accused of organizing a coup.
But even this seeming success proved to be morally ambiguous.
The president had not taken a political decision: he had done a personal favour.
I had received a gift, in itself simply another demonstration of the arbitrary exercise of the strength of the president, and not proof of respect for moral principles.
In one country, I spoke with an Islamic fundamentalist opposition leader, who was launched into a long civil war against the government.
This man fancied himself president of the "National reconciliation committee."
Armed guards to the teeth circled him, although he strongly supported the concept of democracy.
Indeed, he regarded this idea as the most reliable way to power because the vast majority of people thought exactly like him.
He insinuated in a disturbing way that democracy would allow him to "eliminate" those who were opposed to his ideas. (He did not elaborate on the exact meaning of that term.)
In the democracies deprived of democrats, it is even more complicated to discuss human rights than procedural formalities, because these rights are not considered "rights" in the legal sense, but simply as fits of conscience or as gifts to exchange for another valuable asset.
This distinction is particularly important because it draws attention to the limited effectiveness of official legal standards as a means of promoting human rights.
The gap between human rights and the behavior of leaders has led to the greatest change ever in the conduct of international affairs in our time: the advent of "humanitarian intervention."
This change originally occurred outside the established international institutions and the UN system by taking root in a French group Doctors Without Borders who believed that human rights were a more important value than national sovereignty.
Doctors Without Borders has introduced the concept of the "right to intervention" in humanitarian disasters by circumventing the restrictions of classical international law.
Moreover, the international system quickly adopted (and transformed) this notion and several humanitarian interventions
The NATO intervention in Kosovo is a precedent that the American Secretary of State Colin Powell has used to justify the war with Iraq.
But, as convincing as the cause of a military humanitarian intervention may be, such actions must be taken under the auspices of the UN Charter.
After all, the promotion of human rights has been the guiding principle of the establishment of the UN.
His task in this area was declared in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and in the Helsinki accords in 1975, which gave human rights legal supremacy over the sovereignty of individual states.
However, an obvious contradiction exists between the universality and the supremacy of the human rights, as well as the principles of sovereignty and noninterference within the internal matters of the states; which also form the integral part of the documents of the UN.
One way of dealing with this inconsistency is to introduce a new chapter dedicated to human rights into the UN Charter and to reformulate Chapter 4, which concerns the use of force in international relations.
The principle of sovereignty must also be redefined itself.
The world needs a system for granting legal agreements (bilateral and multilateral agreements, institutions of appropriate control and surveillance) to regulate the use of force for humanitarian reasons.
The legal restrictions on humanitarian intervention are necessary because dictators use it too often to justify a criminal assault.
Adolf Hitler drew up its strategy when he dismantled Czechoslovakia, supposedly to defend the Sudeten Germans, and later when he invaded my homeland, Poland.
As Milosevic demonstrated in the 1990s, when he claimed to defend the innocent Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia, justifying military intervention based solely on moral principles leaves too much free rein to distort these principles and abuse.
This is why the debates on the reform of the Security Council should focus not on the modification of its composition, but on its mission.
The council must be explicitly accountable for the "security of mankind" and protection, in addition to its current role of safeguarding of more traditional notions of international security.
The principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of a nation has never been absolute and globalization is confronting this principle with a radical challenge.
The term "international relations" presupposes a Westphalian set of commitments among the sovereign nations, which has replaced the medieval communities defined by personal allegiance to a king.
But the Westphalian system is now in decline, so is the meaning of the state borders.
